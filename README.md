## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the setup instructions in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
3. Run the analysis scripts as described in the setup guide

## Project Overview

This project analyzes contribution guidelines in open-source projects through three main research questions:

1. What are the prevalent contribution guidelines documented in open source projects?
   - Analyzes the presence and patterns of contribution guidelines across different programming languages
   - Identifies standardized guidelines and their adoption rates
   - Examines language-specific patterns in guideline implementation

2. To what extent do PR contributions adhere to the documented contributing guidelines?
   - Tracks changes in guidelines across different project stages
   - Analyzes the evolution of guideline complexity and coverage
   - Identifies patterns in guideline adoption and modification

3. How does adherence to contribution guidelines associate with PR acceptance?
   - Correlates guideline presence with project metrics
   - Analyzes the impact of guidelines on project health
   - Examines the relationship between guideline quality and project success
