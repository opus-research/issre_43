You will receive a JSON file containing clustered contribution guidelines for open source repositories. Each cluster groups guidelines that are similar in meaning or topic.

Your task is to produce a refined, unified, and concise set of high-quality, general-purpose contribution guidelines. Follow these specific steps:

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Normalize Casing and Remove Duplicates:**
   - Treat guidelines with varying casing as identical (e.g., "Adhere to the Coding Style" and "adhere to the coding style" should be considered the same).
   - Completely remove exact duplicates.

2. **Merge Similar or Overlapping Sentences:**
   - Combine guidelines with clear semantic similarity or common meaning into a unified guideline.
   - Examples:
     - "Be Respectful and Collaborative", "Be Respectful and Communicative", "Be Respectful and Considerate", "Be Respectful and Constructive" → "Code of Conduct"
     - "Automated Testing", "Automated Tests", "Create Tests", "Testing" → "Write Automated Tests"

3. **Generalize or Rephrase Clearly:**
   - When merging terms, generalize or rephrase if necessary, but do not overly broaden terms.
   - Exclude overly broad single-word terms (e.g., "acknowledgment") if they naturally fall within a more descriptive guideline.
   - Ensure no similar guidelines end up unnecessarily grouped in a "Miscellaneous" category.

4. **Provide Explanations:**
   - Clearly explain the meaning and purpose of each final guideline in a brief, informative sentence.

5. **Count and List Original Elements:**
   - For each final guideline, list the original elements that were merged and provide the total count of those original elements.

### Output Structure:
Provide your response in the following JSON format:

{
  "final_guidelines": [
    {"Guideline Name": "Clear and concise explanation..."},
    {"Another Guideline": "Another clear explanation..."},
    ...
  ],
  "cluster_mapping": {
    "Guideline Name": {
      "number_of_elements": 4,
      "elements": [
        "Original Element 1",
        "Original Element 2",
        "Original Element 3",
        "Original Element 4"
      ]
    },
    "Another Guideline": {
      "number_of_elements": 3,
      "elements": [
        "Element A",
        "Element B",
        "Element C"
      ]
    },
    ...
  }
}

### Important Notes:
- Be precise in merging terms and avoid creating overly broad or vague categories.
- Aim for clarity, consistency, and conciseness in the final guidelines.
- Ensure all original guidelines are meaningfully grouped without unnecessary miscellaneous clusters.
