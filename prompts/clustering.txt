Read the following document, in triple quotes:

\"\"\"{doc}\"\"\"

This document is part of the documentation for an open-source GitHub project. These documents often 
contain instructions or rules (often called contribution guidelines) on how developers should 
contribute to that specific open-source project.

Summarize, in a JSON those contribution guidelines. Utilize the following template 
{{"guidelines": [{{"title": "short title for the guideline, "description": "a description for that guideline"}}, ...]}}.

Regarding the information contained in each object in the JSON array: the title field should be a 
short title describing the guideline, and the description should be a longer description of the
guideline, and your reasoning for why it is considered a guideline.
