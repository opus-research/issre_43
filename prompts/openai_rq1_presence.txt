You will receive:
1. A list of standardized contribution guidelines, each with a short description.
2. A dictionary of multiple projects. Each project contains a list of guidelines extracted from its CONTRIBUTING.md file.

Your task:
- For each project, go through the standardized list of guidelines.
- For each guideline, check if it is present in the project's list of guidelines.
- Use semantic understanding and synonyms where appropriate (e.g., "Write Automated Tests" is present if the project includes "Write Tests for New Features").
- Return a JSON array where each item is an object with:
  - The project name (as a key)
  - A dictionary of standardized guideline names as keys, with values "yes" or "no"

Only output the JSON array. Do not include explanations or additional text.
