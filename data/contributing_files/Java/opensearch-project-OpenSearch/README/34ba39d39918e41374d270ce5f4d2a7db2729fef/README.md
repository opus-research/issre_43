# OpenSearch

Hello!

OpenSearch is an open source search and analytics engine derived from Elasticsearch 7.10.2, and is currently in a pre-alpha state. While we're still in the process of getting set up, we are excited to build the best distributed search engine on the planet with you.

We'll update this page as the state of the project changes, so please check back frequently.

## Current state of the world
We officially began work on the new fork on January 21st, 2021.  Since then, we've been removing non-Apache code and doing a full rename of the project.

### What works

* All references to non-Apache 2.0 code should be removed, and we should be using the new project name everywhere.
* ./gradlew precommit should be passing.   Please let us know if you see issues.
* CI/CD with a DCO check.

### What doesn't work

* Unit Tests
* Integration Tests
* Version Checks

### Guiding Principles

**Great software**. If it doesn’t solve your problems, everything else is moot. It’s going to be software you love to use.

**Open source like we mean it**. We are invested in this being a successful open source project for the long term. It’s all Apache 2.0. There’s no Contributor License Agreement. Easy.

**A level playing field**. We will not tweak the software so that it runs better for any vendor (including AWS) at the expense of others. If this happens, call it out and we will fix it as a community.

**Used everywhere**. Our goal is for as many people as possible to use it in their business, their software, and their projects. Use it however you want. Surprise us!

**Made with your input**. We will ask for public input on direction, requirements, and implementation for any feature we build.

**Open to contributions**. Great open source software is built together, with a diverse community of contributors. If you want to get involved at any level - big, small, or huge - we will find a way to make that happen. We don’t know what that looks like yet, and we look forward to figuring it out together.

**Respectful, approachable, and friendly**. This will be a community where you will be heard, accepted, and valued, whether you are a new or experienced user or contributor.

**A place to invent**. You will be able to innovate rapidly. This project will have a stable and predictable foundation that is modular, making it easy to extend.

### Watch the forum, because there are a bunch of things we want to talk about
As we've been working, we've come up with a bunch of questions that we wanted to get community feedback on.  Now that we're done with this first pass of renaming, you'll see us posting those questions to the [forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/).  Please let us know your thoughts!
