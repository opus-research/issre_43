# OpenSearch

Hello!

OpenSearch is an open source search and analytics engine derived from Elasticsearch 7.10.2, and is currently in a pre-alpha state. While we're still in the process of getting set up, we are excited to build the best distributed search engine on the planet with you.

We'll update this page as the state of the project changes, so please check back frequently.

## Current state of the world
We officially began work on the new fork on January 21st, 2021.  Since then, we've been removing non-Apache code and doing a full rename of the project.  For more details, <add link to blogpost>

### What works

* All references to non-Apache 2.0 code should be removed, and we should be using the new project name everywhere.
* ./gradlew precommit should be passing.   Please let us know if you see issues.
* CI/CD with a DCO check.

### What doesn't work

* Unit Tests
* Integration Tests
* Version Checks

### Guiding Principles

* Great software. If it doesn’t solve a user's problem, everything else is moot. It shall be software you love to use.

* Open source like we mean it. Contributors shall be invested in this being a successful open source project for the long term. It’s all Apache 2.0. There’s no Contributor License Agreement. Easy.

* A level playing field. Contributors shall not tweak the software so that it runs better for any vendor at the expense of others. If this happens, call it out and the contributors shall fix it together as a community.

* Used everywhere. The project goal is for as many people as possible to use it in their business, their software, and their projects. Use it however you want. Surprise the community!

* Made with community input. Project maintainers shall ask for public input on direction, requirements, and implementation for any feature built.

* Open to all contributions. Great open source software is built together, with a diverse community of contributors. If you want to get involved at any level - big, small, or huge - the project maintainers shall find a way to make it happen.

* Respectful, approachable, and friendly. This will be a community where all will be heard, accepted, and valued, whether a new or experienced user or contributor.

* A place to invent and innovate. You will be able to innovate rapidly. This project shall have a stable and predictable foundation that is modular, making it easy to extend.

### Watch the forum, because there are a bunch of things we want to talk about
As we've been working, we've come up with a bunch of questions that we wanted to get community feedback on.  Now that we're done with this first pass of renaming, you'll see us posting those questions to the forum.  Please let us know your thoughts!
