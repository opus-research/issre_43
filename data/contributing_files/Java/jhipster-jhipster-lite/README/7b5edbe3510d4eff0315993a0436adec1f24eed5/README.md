## Description

JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop & deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures.

**JHipster Lite** will help you to start your project, by generating step by step only what you need.

- The generated code uses [Hexagonal Architecture](./documentation/hexagonal-architecture.md)
- The technical code is separated from your business code
- You will only generate the code you want, no additional unused code
- The best quality as possible: ðŸ’¯% coverage, 0 code smell, no duplication ðŸ˜Ž

## Choosing

The original JHipster and JHLite are **not the same thing**, they are **not generating the same code** and **not serving the same purpose**! Here are some choice elements you can take into account:

![Choosing JHipster](documentation/JHLiteChoice.png)

## Prerequisites

### Java

You need to have Java 17 :

- [JDK 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)

### Node.js and NPM

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): we use Node to run a development web server and build the project. Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.

```
npm ci
```

You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

## Test the project

To launch tests:

```
./mvnw clean test
```

To launch tests and integration tests:

```
./mvnw clean verify
```

## Prettier

We use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and [prettier-java](https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java) to format our code.

To check format:

```
npm run prettier:check
```

To launch format all code:

```
npm run prettier:format
```

## Sonar Analysis

To launch local Sonar Analysis:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Then:

```
./mvnw clean verify sonar:sonar
```

So you can check the result at http://localhost:9001

## Run the project

You can run the project using Maven, as `spring-boot:run` is the default target:

```
./mvnw
```

Or, first, you can package as jar:

```
./mvnw package
```

Then, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

So you can navigate to http://localhost:7471 in your browser.

## Docker/Podman Quickstart

To start a local instance of JHipster Lite, go to your desired application folder and run:

```
docker run --rm --pull=always -p 7471:7471 -v $(pwd):/tmp/jhlite:Z -it jhipster/jhipster-lite:latest
```

Or with podman:

```
podman run --rm --pull=always -p 7471:7471 -v $(pwd):/tmp/jhlite:Z -u root -it jhipster/jhipster-lite:latest
```

Then, go to [http://localhost:7471](http://localhost:7471)

## e2e tests

You need to run the project first. Then, you can run the end-to-end tests:

```
npm run e2e
```

Or in headless mode:

```
npm run e2e:headless
```

## Glyph

If you need to add a new glyph icon, please notice we are using [Fontello](https://fontello.com/). Please read the [help](https://github.com/fontello/fontello/wiki/Help) Fontello section for any questions.

To add a new glyph using Fontello, please launch:

```shell
npm run glyph:open
```

Then, when you've finished, please download the config only and replace it under `src/main/glyph/config.json`.

Now you're able to launch:

```shell
npm run glyph:build
```

This will replace the current _CSS_ and _font_ files into the sources.

## Generate your project

Once started, go to http://localhost:7471, select your option and generate the code you want, step by step, and only what you need.
