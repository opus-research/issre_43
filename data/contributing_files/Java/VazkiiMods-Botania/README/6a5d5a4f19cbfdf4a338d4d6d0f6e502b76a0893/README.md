Welcome to the BotaniaV2 repository.  

Botania is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod based on adding natural magic to the game. It's inspired by other magic mods, such as [Thaumcraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2011841-) or [Blood Magic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1899223-).  

This version is a fork of williewillus' fork of my Botania mod, so in a way we've just gone in a big circle.
