[OpenNMS][]
===========

[OpenNMS][] is the world's first enterprise grade network management application platform developed under the open source model.

Well, what does that mean?

*	World's First

	The OpenNMS project started in July 1999 and was registered on SourceForge in March 2000. It has years of experience on the alternatives.

*	Enterprise Grade

	It was designed from "day one" to monitor tens of thousands to ultimately unlimited devices with a single instance. It brings the power, scalability, and flexibility that enterprises and carriers demand.

*	Application Platform

	While OpenNMS is useful "out of the box," it is designed to be highly customizable to create a unique and integrated management solution.

* Open Source

	OpenNMS is 100% free and open source software, with no license fees, software subscriptions, or special "enterprise" versions.
