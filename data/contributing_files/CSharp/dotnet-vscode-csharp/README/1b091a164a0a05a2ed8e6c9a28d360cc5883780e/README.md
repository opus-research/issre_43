## C# for VIsual Studio Code
C# is an extension that contributes to the larger [C# Dev Kit extension]() for Visual Studio Code to provide performant and reliable language support. Under the hood, this extension is powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) Tools Host which integrates with open source components like Roslyn (Link to Roslyn) and Razor (link to Razor) to provide rich type information and a faster, more reliable C# experience.


C# is the default language support for [C# Dev Kit]() and is shipped as part of that extension as a required dependency.


## Recommended Install
While it is possible to use the C# extension as a standalone extension, we highly recommend using the [C# Dev Kit extension]().

Installing [C# Dev Kit]() will automatically install this extension as a required dependency
* If working on a solution that requires versions prior to .NET 6, install a Full Framework runtime and MSBuild tooling.
  * Set omnisharp.useModernNet to false and dotnet.server.useOmnisharp to true
  * Windows: .NET Framework along with MSBuild Tools 
  * MacOS/Linux: Mono with MSBuild 

## Features
  * Refactoring
  * Code Navigation (GTD, FAR)
  * Code Completions
  * Roslyn powered semantic awareness

## How to use Omnisharp?
If you don‚Äôt want to take advantage of the great Language Server features, you can revert back to using Omnisharp by going to the Extension settings and setting `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp` to true. This will require that you restart VS Code to take effect.


## Found a Bug?
To file a new issue to include all the related config information directly from vscode by entering the command pallette with Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and running CSharp: Report an issue command. This will open a browser window with all the necessary information related to the installed extensions, dotnet version, mono version, etc. Enter all the remaining information and hit submit.
