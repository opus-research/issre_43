## C# for Visual Studio Code
C# is the feature-rich, language support for C# and is shipped as part of [C# Dev Kit][csdevkitextension]. This version of the extension is currently in pre-release and available for you to use today.

C# is an extension that contributes to the [C# Dev Kit extension][csdevkitextension] for Visual Studio Code to provide performant and reliable language support. Under the hood, this extension is powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) Tools Host which integrates with open source components like [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)  and [Razor](https://github.com/dotnet/razor) to provide rich type information and a faster, more reliable C# experience.

## Recommended Install
While it is possible to use the C# extension as a standalone extension, we highly recommend using [C# Dev Kit][csdevkitextension].

1. Installing [C# Dev Kit][csdevkitextension] will automatically install this extension as a required dependency
2. Open a folder/workspace that contains a C# project (.csproj) and a C# solution (.sln) and the extension will activate.
3. Whether you install C# Dev Kit or just the C# extension, the [.NET Runtime Installer Tool extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime) will be installed as a dependency.

Note: If working on a solution that requires versions prior to .NET 6, install a Full Framework runtime and MSBuild tooling.
  * Set omnisharp.useModernNet to false and if you are on the pre-release verion, set dotnet.server.useOmnisharp to true
  * Windows: .NET Framework along with MSBuild Tools 
  * MacOS/Linux: Mono with MSBuild 

## Features
  * Refactoring
  * Code Navigation (GTD, FAR)
  * Code Completions
  * Roslyn powered semantic awareness

## How to use OmniSharp?
If you don‚Äôt want to take advantage of the great Language Server features, you can revert back to using OmniSharp in the pre-release extension by going to the Extension settings and setting `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp` to true. This will require that you restart VS Code to take effect. You can also switch back to the Switch to Release Version to revert back to the C# extension powered by OmniSharp.


## Found a Bug?
To file a new issue to include all the related config information directly from vscode by entering the command pallette with Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and running CSharp: Report an issue command. This will open a browser window with all the necessary information related to the installed extensions, dotnet version, mono version, etc. Enter all the remaining information and hit submit. 
Alternatively you could visit https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/issues  and file a new one.
