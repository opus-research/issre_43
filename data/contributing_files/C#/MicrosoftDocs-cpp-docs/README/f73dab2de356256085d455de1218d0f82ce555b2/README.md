# Visual Studio documentation for Microsoft C++

Welcome! This repository contains source files for the work-in-progress Microsoft C++ (MSVC or Visual C++) technical documentation. The articles are published on the [C++ in Visual Studio documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp).

The documentation for Visual Basic and Visual C# are located in a separate repository at [https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs), and the Visual Studio documentation is located in the repository located at [https://github.com/Microsoft/visualstudio-docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualstudio-docs).

## Contributing to the documentation

We welcome your contributions to help us improve the MSVC docs. For a comprehensive guide to contributing to docs.microsoft.com, see the [Microsoft Docs contributor guide overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute). For details on how to make a contribution to the MSVC documentation, see the [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Several feature areas of MSVC have their own folders in this repository, such as `standard-library` for articles on the C++ Standard Library, `ide` for C++-specific articles on the Visual Studio interactive development environment (IDE), and so forth. The `/media` subfolder in each folder contains art files for the articles. The [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) has more information.
