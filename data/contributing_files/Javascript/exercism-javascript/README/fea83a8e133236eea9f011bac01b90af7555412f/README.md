**Exercism exercises in JavaScript**

This is the JavaScript track, one of the many tracks on [Exercism][web-exercism]. It holds all the _exercises_ that are currently implemented and available for students to complete. The track consists of various **core** exercises - the ones a student _must_ complete - and each **core** exercise may unlock various _side_ exercises. You can find this in the [`config.json`][file-config].

> In version 3 of Exercism, the above no longer holds. See the [`exercism/v3`][git-v3] repository for more information.

## Tools

See [CONTRIBUTING.md][file-contributing] for a list of requirements to
contribute to this track. It also has a list of tools you can use, of which the
`test` tool is one of them.

## Running the test suite

This runs `jest` tests for all sample solutions. This _does not_ use the regular way to run `jest`, because the example solution files must be renamed to be imported correctly into the test files.

```shell
npx babel-node scripts/test
```

If the `ASSIGNMENT` environment variable is set, only _that_ exercise is tested. For example, if you only want to test the `example.js` for the practice exercise `two-fer`, you may, depending on your environment, use:

```shell
ASSIGNMENT=practice/two-fer npx babel-node scripts/test
```

> Running on Windows? Depending on your shell, environment variables are set differently. You can use `cross-env` to normalize this. The following should work across environments:
>
> ```bash
> npx cross-env ASSIGNMENT=practice/two-fer babel-node scripts/test
> ```
