# Submitting Bugs

When submitting bugs, be sure to indicate the version you are using as well as full text of the problematic JavaScript code (if any). Also, include the exact console output.

# Working on Bugs

If you're going to work on a bug, please add a comment to that bug saying so and indicating when you think you will complete it. It will help us to avoid duplication of effort. A good comment is like, "I'll take a look at this over the weekend" or "I'm going to do this, give me two weeks."

# Working with Code

When you submit code to the ESLint project, you agree:

1. To allow the ESLint project to use your submitted code in any way.
2. The code you wrote is your original work.
3. You are capable of granting rights for the submitted code.
