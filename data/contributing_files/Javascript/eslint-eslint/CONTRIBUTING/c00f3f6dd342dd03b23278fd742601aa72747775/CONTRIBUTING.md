# Submitting Bugs

When submitting bugs, be sure to indicate the version you are using as well as full text of the problematic JavaScript code (if any). Also, include the exact console output.

# Working on Bugs

If you're going to work on a bug, please add a comment to that bug saying so and indicating when you think you will complete it. It will help us to avoid duplication of effort. A good comment is like, "I'll take a look at this over the weekend" or "I'm going to do this, give me two weeks."

# Pull Requests

Some general guidelines for sending pull requests to ESLint:

* All PRs must have an accompanying issue. Preferably, open the issue first describing the problem you're trying to solve and then send the PR. No PRs will be accepted without a related issue. The reason is that there may be multiple attempts to address the issue before it can be closed. One issue may end up with several PRs, but the issue is always the source of truth as to why code was submitted.
* All code must be submitted with tests. No exceptions.
* If the PR adds, changes, or removes functionality then it is expected to be accompanied by corresponding documentation changes (see the `docs/` folder). That also means that if there is no documentation for what you're working on, you must add it.
* All code must be in a format consistent with the rest of the codebase.

# Contributing Code

When you submit code to the ESLint project, you agree:

1. To allow the ESLint project to use your submitted code in any way.
2. The code you wrote is your original work.
3. You are capable of granting rights for the submitted code.
