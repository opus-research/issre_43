# jQuery Contribution Guidelines

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution.

Contributors to jQuery should be willing to sign our [jQuery Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://jquery.github.com/cla.html) which indicates you're allowing the project to license your code and that you have the right to grant that license. If you are employed or have created some of the code under a paid contract, please ensure that other parties agree with the decision to contribute.


Once you've submitted the CLA, please read the following contribution guidelines...

1. [Getting Involved](http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved)
2. [Core Style Guide](http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines)
3. [Tips For Bug Patching](http://docs.jquery.com/Tips_for_jQuery_Bug_Patching)
