# Contributing

## Quick Start

Clone repo:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/opal/opal.git
```

Get dependencies:

```
$ bundle
```

## Tests

You need phantomjs installed to run tests. To build opal, its dependencies
and all specs, run:

```
$ rake
```

You can alternatively run tests in a browser using:

```
$ rackup
```

And then opening `http://127.0.0.1:9292` in a web browser.
