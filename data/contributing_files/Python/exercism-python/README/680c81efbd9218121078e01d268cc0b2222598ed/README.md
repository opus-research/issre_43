:wave: Thank you for your interest in contributing to the exercism Python track!  

:warning: **Please Note** :warning:

We are currently in the middle of re-arranging and re-configuring  our track for exercism V3. 

We're **super-excited** :tada: :rocket: -- _and we really want you to be involved!_ -- but all that inital configuration work means **our maintainers can't accept unsolicited contributions at this time.**

Please check our [issue list](https://github.com/exercism/python/labels/help%20wanted) for tasks we've flagged as `[help wanted]`  -- _and check back_ -- we'll be adding (_many more!_) tasks with that flag in the coming weeks as we update our documentation and identify exercises, documents, and bugs that need to be worked on before our V3 launch.

Exercism exercises in Python  


## Contributing Guide

Our WIP V3 documenatation can be found here:  [exercism V3](https://github.com/exercism/docs).


### Testing

All exercises must be compatible with Python version 3.8 upwards.  We no longer support Python 2.x.

To test a single exercise:
```
python3 test/check-exercises.py [exercise-name]
```

To test all exercises:
```
python3 test/check-exercises.py
```


### Code Style

The Python code in this repo is meant to follow the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (a stylized version http://pep8.org).

This repo uses [flake8](http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) with default settings to enforce the coding standard.
