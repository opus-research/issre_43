Hi. &nbsp;👋🏽 &nbsp;👋 &nbsp;**We are happy you are here.**&nbsp; 🎉&nbsp;🌟

**`exercsim/Python`** is one of many programming language tracks on [exercism(dot)org][exercism-website].
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Python *exercises* currently under development or implemented & available for students.

 🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Track exercises support Python `3.8`.  
 🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Track tooling (_test-runner, representer, analyzer, and Continuous Integration_) runs on Python `3.9`.

Exercises are grouped into **concept** exercises which teach the [Python syllabus][python-syllabus], and **practice** exercises, which are unlocked by progressing in the syllabus tree &nbsp;🌴 &nbsp;. Concept exercises are constrained to a small set of language or syntax features. Practice exercises are open-ended, and can be used to practice concepts learned, try out new techniques, and _play_.  These two exercise groupings can be found in the track [config.json][config-json], and under the `python/exercises` directory.
