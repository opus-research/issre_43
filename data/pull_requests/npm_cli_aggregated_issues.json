      "I would strongly suggest keeping licensee; especially with its community corrections overrides, it's going to be more robust than a homegrown script.",
      "This is much better, but will still break whenever v11 comes out - what's the benefit of hiding the dependency information by not listing it explicitly? Listing it explicitly means tooling is aware of it.",
      "It uses a lot of the same subdependencies as npm, but it uses older versions of them.  There is quite a bit of cognitive load trying to manage them in the tree and disregard them as not something to update.",
      "when you say \"manage them in the tree\", do you mean in the lockfile? or do you mean that npm vendors dev deps as well as runtime deps? (perhaps only runtime deps should be vendored, if so)",
      "We update deps in npm every release, it is a very mentally intensive process because of the nature of npm, every update is done individually and checked.  Checking for outdated deps is also done every time and these only make the process more exhausting.  This is a quality of life improvement for the folks who maintain npm.  Arguments coming from the perspective of ideals or the purity of architecture are not going to carry any weight here.",
      "If `npx licensee` breaks when v11 comes out, we will either fix it or use `npx licensee@10` with a todo to migrate in the future. I think its actually good we use `npx licensee` here so we know when v11 comes out. Keeping it as a dev dep would give us the same benefit of course.\r\n\r\nBut currently `licensee` creates a lot of noise when running `npm ls` locally. Reducing this noise is worth whatever time we spend in the future fixing licensee or staying on an outdated version.",
      "Alrighty. Seems like a motivation to change the workflow so npm maintainers' quality of life isn't dramatically worse than everyone else's :-) but obv its up to yall",
      "The best future here would be `npm outdated` (or any command) taking any `--query` as a parameter. We'd codify that via a run-script in our repo and then `npm run my-outdated` would skip anything we consider non-essential to our usual outdated checking. The `dev` vs `prod` binary doesn't cut it here.\r\n\r\nBut that will take substantially longer than replacing `licensee` with `npx licensee`. 😄 "

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/8836089933\n### Release Checklist for v10.6.0\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 7368 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.6.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.6.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.6.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.6.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",
      "Test failures in `18.x` have to do w/ the test suite, not w/ an actual bug.  Tests work in isolation and if coverage is disabled.  We still want to track this down but it shouldn't block the release.",

That would only happen on `npm` itself (because npm bundles all of its dependencies) meaning that we'd be aborting long before we removed the existing global npm package.\r\n\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm i -g npm@latest --loglevel verbose\r\nnpm verb cli /Users/wraithgar/.nvm/versions/node/v20.10.0/bin/node /Users/wraithgar/.nvm/versions/node/v20.10.0/bin/npm\r\nnpm info using npm@10.5.1\r\nnpm info using node@v20.10.0\r\nnpm verb title npm i npm@latest\r\nnpm verb argv \"i\" \"--global\" \"npm@latest\" \"--loglevel\" \"verbose\"\r\nnpm verb logfile logs-max:10 dir:/Users/wraithgar/.npm/_logs/2024-04-06T18_08_01_736Z-\r\nnpm verb logfile /Users/wraithgar/.npm/_logs/2024-04-06T18_08_01_736Z-debug-0.log\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/npm 234ms (cache revalidated)\r\nnpm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/npm 11ms (cache hit)\r\n\r\nchanged 14 packages in 12s\r\nnpm verb exit 0\r\nnpm info ok \r\n```",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/8636314481\n### Release Checklist for v10.5.2\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 7341 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.5.2` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.5.2\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.5.2 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.5.2 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/8540421858\n### Release Checklist for v10.5.1\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 7265 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.5.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.5.1\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.5.1 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6.

There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [x] 11.

      "I don't think it makes sense to hardcode just node and npm - there's lots of things that can go in `engines`, and all of them should be supported whether in `devEngines` or `publishConfig.engines`.",
      "Makes sense, `engines-*` it is although `npm` should only really care about validating `npm` & `node`. Since that check isn't happening today, & would be a breaking change to add it, maybe it can be thrown into a separate PR (or shipped behind a flag) while the net-new config & `publishConfig.engines.*` shenanigans can likely be added as semver-minor.",
      "If this field could be made equivalent with [Corepack’s `\"packageManager\"` field](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#when-authoring-packages), we could suggest that Corepack switch to using this field instead. Then the three major package managers would all respect the same field that denotes desired package manager and version.\r\n\r\nWhat this would need for equivalence is support for URLs (to download the package manager version) and hashes (to validate the download). See:\r\n```json\r\n\"packageManager\": \"yarn@3.2.3+sha224.953c8233f7a92884eee2de69a1b92d1f2ec1655e66d08071ba9a02fa\"\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```json\r\n\"packageManager\": \"yarn@https://registry.npmjs.org/@yarnpkg/cli-dist/-/cli-dist-3.2.3.tgz#sha224.16a0797d1710d1fb7ec40ab5c3801b68370a612a9b66ba117ad9924b\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously npm would have no use for these, but there would need to be a place to define these values in `devEngines` so that Corepack could use them. If there was, then Corepack could migrate to using `devEngines` with no loss of functionality on Corepack’s side.",
      "I don’t think that expansion of the field makes sense; that functionality in corepack is both recent and ill-advised and i wouldn’t want to see it replicated anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThis field is intended to only be the dev-time mirror of the engines field (or, in the alternative explanation, the publish-time mirror).",
      "In order to not shard our design efforts it is probably worthwhile to keep discussion in https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/51888 for now.  I like the idea of having a discrete \"interacting with this as an app\" directive for npm that is different than \"interacting with this as a published package\".  I don't know that a net new top level attribute for this single function is the right approach.  We're heading in the right direction though. See you in the other issue.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this not as a hard \"no\" but (hopefully) in service of consolidating design concerns.",
      "@wraithgar I don't think it's a good idea to delay this long-discussed and much-needed feature indefinitely until something larger and more complex is designed and widely shipped .\r\n\r\nIf you don't want a top-level attribute, what do you think about the `publishConfig.engines` approach suggested by @darcyclarke?",

      "> It just feels bad to know exactly what the user wants, and then just not do it\r\n\r\nIn my experience maintaining the npm cli for many years now, many of the issues I end up having to deal with were past developers guessing what the user really wanted.  We are not guessing anymore, being explicit is always going to be the better option."

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/8084611647\n### Release Checklist for v10.5.0\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 7184 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.5.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.5.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.5.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.5.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

This change makes it very hard to separate the `npm pack` command's output with the one from the lifecycle hooks. ~Does adding sth like a `--silent` flag make sense?~ There's actually the (global?) `--silent` flag, and using it to prevent printing stdout of hooks would probably make sense to me.\r\n\r\nUpdate: should have looked up before posting, there's already a bug linked there that was closed and mentions using `--foreground-scripts=false` which actually does what i need (but somehow isn't documented in the command's help).",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/7643624304\n### Release Checklist for v10.4.0\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 7140 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.4.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.4.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.4.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.4.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/7477605239\n### Release Checklist for v10.3.0\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 7122 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.3.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.3.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.3.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.3.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",
      "The cacache update made arborist reify tests very flaky, this PR should if possible wait for https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/7124 which is waiting for https://github.com/isaacs/promise-call-limit/pull/12",
      "Since the failures are tests and not npm itself (folks on resource-limited environments should already be seeing a need for increased timeouts and would set those accordingly) this PR is good to go.",

      "Hi, there. It's my first time to contribute to the repo. Thank you very much.",
      "Won't this still omit the package-lock if the package.json is an empty object?",

      "Thanks very much for the response, @wraithgar, I'll try to figure that out.",
      "Hi, @wraithgar, would you take another look?",
      "This would need a test.",
      "Hi, @wraithgar, I have added tests, would you take a look when you have time?",
      "I have fixed the smoke-test proxy test.",
      "I took a look and I think the fact that you had to add `name` to all those fixtures is a signal that this isn't quite right.  Unless I'm mistaken `@npmcli/package-json` will throw an exception by default if you give it a directory with either no package-json file, or one that does not parse correctly.  The fact that it is empty shouldn't matter.  I suspect that code was left over from when you were using the previous module, which returned an empty object by default.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother wrinkle here is that I think this check is going to have to happen in Arborist.  Consider this situation\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install abbrev --no-save\r\nmkdir sub\r\ncd sub\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate the same error state, i.e. a package-lock written to the main folder, but this code wouldn't catch it.  This is because Arborist does some tree walking to see if any parent directories are in fact the root of the module.  The presence of a `node_modules` folder is one such signal.\r\n\r\nWhat's frustrating is that it appears that wherever is throwing this error is not being properly caught by npm in a way where the error stack is preserved.  It appears to be generated without one.  After some digging it looks like this is a failure of `@npmcli/run-script` in the situation where a package-json file is missing.\r\n\r\nSo.  We likely have two bugs here:\r\n\r\nFirst, we have a situation where there is no package.json file, but `npm install` is called.  In that case, Arborist handles things just fine, but when npm goes to try to run the lifecycle scripts it throws an exception.  Either `run-script` needs to more gracefully handle the situation, or npm needs to not call it in this situation.\r\n\r\nSecond, we have a situation where sometimes Arborist is told to reify a truly empty directory.  That is, one with no package lock, package.json, OR node_modules.  In that very limited situation it should not be writing the package lock file.  We need a much more fine tuned test inside arborist itself to prevent this bug.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately when I made this statement\r\n\r\n> Arborist should never be given the task of reifying if npm is ultimately going to throw an exception.\r\n\r\nIt was before we knew that there were two bugs.  What we should be saying is \"Arborist should not write the package-lock on a truly empty set of folders (no package.json, lock, or node_modules)\" and \"npm should not error when trying to run lifecycle scripts when there is no package.json\"",
      "Also as a side task I have made https://github.com/npm/run-script/issues/190 and assigned it to myself.  We are obviously not done in the process of moving onto that consolidated module for all package json parsing.",
      "Hi, @wraithgar, I have confusion on your comment, would you mind elaborate for me?\r\n\r\n>  I suspect that code was left over from when you were using the previous module, which returned an empty object by default.\r\n\r\nI suspect when you mention **previous module** you mean the `rpj` call using `read-package-json-fast`. What is **that code** which is left over referring to?\r\n\r\n> What's frustrating is that it appears that wherever is throwing this error is not being properly caught by npm in a way where the error stack is preserved.

The `rpj` throw a 'ENOENT` error, why do we need to generate an error stack here?",
      "\"that code\" refers to all the code checking if what was returned was an empty object or not.  That's immaterial when using `@npmcli/package-json`, either it returns a parsed package.json file or it throws an exception.\r\n\r\nThe generating an error stack comment was about how hard it was to debug.   Without one we have no way of knowing where that error is being thrown from.  I did discover it however, and it is in fact the run-script call.",

      "Another clue is: one of the workspace was dependent on another workspace but its dependency version was different.\r\n\r\nExample:  `a` is dependent on `b@0.0.1`, but `b` package.json version is 0.0.2.\r\n```\r\n.\r\n+-- package.json\r\n`-- packages\r\n   +-- a@0.0.1\r\n   |   `-- package.json (depends on b@0.0.1)\r\n   `-- b@0.0.2\r\n       `-- package.json\r\n```\r\nThat solves it for me so I'll stop here and open another issue if I encounter these errors again. Hope that helps someone.",

      "Ah, so maybe not for `C:` but for external drives, that makes much more sense - thanks.",
      "No problem :). I only did `C:\\\\` in the install command test because I wasn't sure what other drive letters would be available in the GitHub Actions runners but I knew C would definitely be there.",
      "As mentioned in [npm/name-from-folder/pull/36](https://github.com/npm/name-from-folder/pull/36#issuecomment-1838995038) I'm hesitant to go down this path, frankly. I think this is a good restriction and keeps a lot of odd (and maybe even potentially dangerous) setups from happening.",
      "As mentioned in https://github.com/npm/name-from-folder/pull/36 I can agree that package installs in a macOS or Linux root directory wouldn't make much sense, but there can be some sense for Windows drives (excluding C drive) as if you have an external drive on Windows and you only want to have your JS project on it then you may want to just install the packages in the root directory. I don't use Windows so I haven't had that situation happen to me before but I know of a few people who have tried doing that before and got an npm error.\r\n\r\nIf your issue is only with boot drive root directories, I could make changes to only allow installs in non boot drive directories. Since the behaviour in https://github.com/npm/name-from-folder/pull/36 was incorrect for `name-from-folder` I have since closed that pull request and could make that change in this repository without needing changes from `name-from-folder`.\r\n\r\nRight now when installing packages in a root directory npm gives you one of two errors. `Tracker \"idealTree\" already exists` if you are on macOS or Linux, or a `mkdir` issue if you are on Windows. If root directory installs should not be allowed, I think an easy to understand error should be shown telling the user that they cannot install packages in a root directory and that they should create a subdirectory first. I could make that change in a new pull request or this one, whichever would be best.",
      "This is a similar problem to what is experience in docker containers, and it is solved by the convention of putting your code in a folder like `/app`.  It's a good convention, especially in thumb drives where there is a much more restricted limit on the number of files you can have in the root, versus in a subdirectory.  It's just all around best not to put things in the root folder.",

This change fixes generated relationship entries so that the `relationshipType` aligns with the direction of the dependency relationship being described.\r\n\r\nFor some types of relationships SPDX defines a pair of related types which can be used to describe dependency relationships from either parent-to-child or child-to-parent. For example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"spdxElementId\": \"parent-1.0.0\",\r\n  \"relatedSpdxElement\": \"child-1.0.0\",\r\n  \"relationshipType\": \"DEPENDS_ON\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich can also be represented as \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"spdxElementId\": \"child-1.0.0\",\r\n  \"relatedSpdxElement\": \"parent-1.0.0\",\r\n  \"relationshipType\": \"DEPENDENCY_OF\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how the second example swaps the place of the parent/child and switches the relationship type from \"DEPENDS_ON\" to \"DEPENDENCY_OF\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not all of the SPDX-supported relationship types have a matched inverse. Specifically, `OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY_OF` and `DEV_DEPENDENCY_OF` have no matching type which would allow the relationship to be reversed (`HAS_OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY` and `HAS_DEV_DEPENDENCY` would make sense, but aren't supported in the SPDX spec).\r\n\r\nIn order to consistently represent ALL of the different relationships and ensure that the supplied type properly describes the direction of the relationship, we're going to swap the position of the parent/child nodes in the relationship (`spdxElementId` will always reference the child, while `relatedSpdxElement` will always reference the parent) and exclusively use the child-to-parent relationship type labels: `DEPENDENCY_OF`, `DEV_DEPENDENCY_OF`, `OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY_OF`, and `PREREQUISITE_FOR`.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nFixes https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/6867\r\n",

    "body": "A first step in fixing the overrides feature. In this PR I'm aiming to fix 3 bugs:\r\n\r\n1. When we add an edge going into a node we update the node's overrides, but we don't update the overrides of that node's outgoing edges, and so forth. We need the up-to-date overrides to filter through.\r\n2. When we remove an edge going into a node we don't update the overrides at all (and we don't update the outgoing edges like in the previous bug).\r\n3. When we add an edge going in, and we already have a different override set for the node, we just ignore the existing override set and overwrite it with that of the new edge. Instead, this PR chooses the most specific override set. This still isn't the absolutely correct logic, since different override sets can have implications down the line of the dependency chain, but it has the advantage of being **consistent** (instead of just going with the last edge in). Also, it raises an error if it encounters a real conflict, meaning two incoming edges with override sets that aren't just a subset of one another.\r\nSo if we have dependency chains A->B->C and A->C, and we override C under B, then C will be overridden.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nFixes some of the override [issues](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/5850).",

This is not a simple thing 😵 ",
      "@jdalton @jakubmazanec @jbjhjm \r\nThe whole overrides mechanism is broken and in my opinion non-functional - it's inconsistent between two consecutive runs of `npm install`, it silently reverts overrides without so much as showing a warning, sometimes it just ignores the overrides completely, sometimes it only applies for some instances but not all of the overridden library.\r\nThe underlying [issue](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/5850) was identified at least going back to 2022. When I realized that it silently reverts overrides (which are often done due to security issues within transitive dependencies) - I contacted the npm team and convinced them to upgrade it to a P0 bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral months later, after the issue still went unresolved, I dove deep into the code and found exactly what's broken in it (the description at the header is the tip of the iceberg). I've done numerous fixes and got it to work properly on numerous test cases.\r\nSo I opened this PR as the first step in fixing the mechanism. Several more PRs are necessary, but I wanted to add them incrementally to make sure we don't create accidental breakages (some people might be implicitly relying on the random erroneous behavior).\r\nHowever almost a year later, despite being aimed at solving a P0 bug, and even though npm major version 10 has been released, this PR still hasn't gone through any kind of code review (and at least insofar as to how correctly raise errors or write warnings in the CLI - it needs the maintainers' attention). I've mapped out the bugs, and I'll be happy to engage with the maintainers regarding the code fixes if they prefer to write them themselves.\r\n\r\nBut right now except forking npm I'm not sure what to do...",
      "Thanks @AlonNavon for making this PR, it takes quite a bit of time and effort to fix these kinds of bugs.  Arborist is a very complicated piece of npm.\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that this PR has sat so long, but this has proven to require more focused attention than we were able to give it.  It also of course fell through the cracks as time went on, and as other priorities demanded attention.  External PRs are the lifeblood of npm, and having them sit like this is does nobody any good.\r\n\r\nSo, again, thank you for your time on this and for continuing to bring it back to our attention.\r\n\r\nYes, overrides needs work.  That you are willing not only to fix an immediate problem but are willing to work on this in phases to fix things more holistically is, frankly, wonderful.  Doubly so given that you hadn't received much feedback in the interim.  Thank you for sticking with it.\r\n\r\nThank you also @jdalton for offering to help.  It would be most welcome.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are working on getting [npm 11](https://github.com/npm/statusboard/issues/898) started, so that we don't fall behind Node.js's release cycle.  It is a very conservative release, mostly cleanup of old code whose removal constitutes a breaking change. And of course there is the engines update which allows us to keep our dependencies up to date.  There is also a growing list of external PRs that we need to review.  Any PR that is beyond a simple bug fix does take some dedicated time and focus, and that is a precious commodity.\r\n\r\nThis bug fix is important, fixing overrides is important.  So let's get in to what will help this land.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the code at a glance looks fine.  What gives us the most pause is the large chunk of net new code in Arborist.  This is by necessity something that we have to take more care with than a typical PR.  The tests for Arborist aren't the strongest: they are mostly unit tests with not a lot of them interacting w/ the module as a whole.  Side effects usually are a problem with these PRs.  Given that y'all are willing to stick with this makes it easier to accept, because the thing we are mostly trying to avoid is tech debt that nobody is going to have capacity to go address.\r\n\r\nSecond off, having another party willing to help review helps.  I think if we get to a point where the PR author, @jdalton, and myself think things look good we can land it.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would appreciate a more specific callout of what you need from me.  I know it's probably frustrating to be given MORE work here, especially since you've put so much into this already.  Unfortunately that's the reality we're dealing with.  This isn't something I'm going to be able to focus on deeply enough to know what you need from me.  So let's start here:\r\n\r\n> and at least insofar as to how correctly raise errors or write warnings in the CLI - it needs the maintainers' attention\r\n\r\nPlease `@` mention me to point out where in the code you're looking for this feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who have interacted with this issue, even if it was a simple upvote.",
      "We would of course prefer that the majority of our work happen in GitHub issues and PRs, but if you feel you need to talk in a context that is more high bandwidth (but also more time constrained) you can find us in the `#npm` channel in the [OpenJS slack](openjs-foundation.slack.com).",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/8054462488\n### Release Checklist for v9.9.3\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 7010 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.9.3` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.9.3\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.9.3 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout release/v9\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/release/v9\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b release/v9 -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v9.9.3 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/7120526625\n### Release Checklist for v10.2.5\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 7009 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.2.5` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.2.5\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.2.5 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.2.5 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6867094909\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `release/v9`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r release/v9 -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6988\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.9.2\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6988 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.9.2` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.9.2\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.9.2 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout release/v9\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/release/v9\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b release/v9 -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v9.9.2 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6869803931\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6970\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.2.4\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6970 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.2.4` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.2.4\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.2.4 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.2.4 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6737229304\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6959\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.2.3\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6959 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.2.3` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.2.3\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.2.3 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.2.3 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v9.9.1 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6923\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.2.2\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6923 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.2.2` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.2.2\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.2.2 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8.

      "This command does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Execute lifecycle scripts (`preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, `prepare`)\r\n2. Links bins depending on whether bin links are enabled\r\n\r\nThis command is particularly useful in scenarios including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Installing a new version of **node.js**, where you need to recompile all your C++ add-ons with the updated binary.\r\n2. Installing with `--ignore-scripts` and `--no-bin-links`, to explicitly choose which packages to build and/or link bins.\r\n\r\nIf one or more package specs are provided, then only packages with a name and version matching one of the specifiers will be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nUsually, you should not need to run `npm rebuild` as it is already done for you as part of npm install (unless you suppressed these steps with `--ignore-scripts` or `--no-bin-links`).\r\n\r\nIf there is a `binding.gyp` file in the root of your package, then npm will use a default install hook:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n    \"install\": \"node-gyp rebuild\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis default behavior is suppressed if the `package.json` has its own `install` or `preinstall` scripts.

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6565239495\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6863\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.2.1\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6863 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.2.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.2.1\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.2.1 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.2.1 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6386230048\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6790\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.2.0\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6790 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.2.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.2.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.2.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.2.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

When workspaces are involved you can't reliably walk back up the dependency tree in this direction (`ArboristNode`s representing a workspace have no `edgesIn`).\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix updates the `hasAscendant` function to also follow the `linksIn` collection when trying to find a path to the selected node.

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6126182691\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6764\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.1.0\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6764 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.1.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.1.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.1.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.1.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "Not sure why CI is having the specific errors it is, but when I run config tests locally they don't pass, and there are coverage issues.  Does `npm test -w @npmcli/config` pass locally for you?",
      "I'm surprised it's trying to run against node <18. This commit definitely broke the runs on node 14: https://github.com/npm/cli/commit/b8a5764db60cb2b3edb7887cf4379f48411a0b55\r\n\r\nNo, the CI is not currently passing for me locally. ~~I suspect it has to do with this gotcha [from the docs](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#requiremain):~~\r\n\r\n~~> When the entry point is not a CommonJS module, require.main is undefined, and the main module is out of reach.~~\r\n\r\nI had to adjust some tests to account for moving logic out of the flatten helper.\r\n\r\nI'll figure out the coverage issue once I verify the tests run as expected.",
      "The last commit (https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/6762/commits/b8b1db3974112d784df3475fb57338975ee65874#) I'm slightly unsure about.\r\n\r\nThis commit started writing to the variable: https://github.com/npm/cli/commit/c3ba1daf7cd335d72aeba80ae0e9f9d215ca9ea5\r\nBut I can't figure out why we would ever read *from* this variable. It seems to maybe have originated in testing code here and accidentally copied into the main code flow: https://github.com/npm/config/commit/fd6432eb242b2b427d1fdef19274c1ca6fea37dd\r\n\r\nEDIT: it also seems like inheriting this value is probably unexpected, given https://github.com/npm/config/pull/12 for the closely related `$INIT_CWD` (which you may remember from the above-mentioned https://github.com/npm/cli/commit/c3ba1daf7cd335d72aeba80ae0e9f9d215ca9ea5)\r\n\r\nYour thoughts are much appreciated.",
      "BTW, as of now, test cases all pass for me and coverage is at 100%.",
      "I agree that the `process.env.NODE` is in all likelihood a dependency injection leftover from a test.  I don't know if that means we can remove it.\r\n\r\nHistorically we have been removing the ability to change things like this, for instance in npm 10 re removed the `ci-name` config.  Previously we also did not allow folks to change what the path to `npm` was in scripts.\r\n\r\nHowever, removing this could be a [breaking change to folks](https://xkcd.com/1172/).  We're gonna have to leave it in.  *However* I also think we shouldn't worry about covering that in testing.  Can you add `/* istanbul ignore next */` to the line before it, and put it back in?\r\n\r\nI'll add a note to the [npm 11 roadmap](https://github.com/npm/statusboard/issues/488) to remove it for real.",

Can you add `/* istanbul ignore next */` to the line before it, and put it back in?\r\n\r\nI thought about that and it makes me feel icky. The ignored path is the one MOST COMMON in practice. This PR is already a breaking change, and insofar as the NODE environment variable does anything, it’s a bug as well.\r\n\r\nIf you still insist, I can move it to another PR.",
      "Ok lemme noodle on it.\r\n\r\nUltimately the NODE environment is in all likelihood trying to solve the problem of having everything in side the npm lifecycle use the same node version as the one that npm was ran with.  I do remember this being an issue in the past, we don't want to support running different versions of node or npm in subprocesses.  In the past this manifested as refusing to support a config that told npm what version of node to run, that's an OS concern.\r\n\r\nI think removing it may be the right choice here but as you can imagine we are trying to be extremely cautious with things that could break other folks.",
      "> Ok lemme noodle on it.\r\n\r\n@wraithgar, what did your noodle say?",
      "Woohoo!\r\n\r\n> We can re-export NODE if an edge case we didn't know about comes to light.\r\n\r\nI didn’t stop exporting `$NODE` to subprocess - I stopped npm from *importing* it from the parent process.",

      "@yukukotani (cc @wraithgar) this is rad! A question about intended behavior on this feature:\r\n\r\n1. If an invalid arch and/or os flag is provided, no platform-specific dependencies are installed, and npm exits 0. I would consider that worthy of an error state; by exiting 0, we would lack the ability to know whether the command was malformed (perhaps due to typo, or by using `x86_64` instead of `x64`, etc.). Was this intentional?\r\n\r\n2. If a valid arch and/or os flag is provided, but the platform-specific dependency does not exist, nothing is installed and npm exits 0. I would also consider this an error state. If I am specifying os / arch to obtain a specific build of a native module, it should be assumed that the application that uses this dependency would be broken if that dependency isn't present. Was this intentional?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nTested with npm 10.2.3",
      "Yes, this is intentional as all of these are optional dependencies, and missing an optional dependency is never an error state.\r\n\r\nFor 1, this is input validation which would need to happen in the config declaration. Off the top of my head I don't know what the valid set of parameters would be.\r\n\r\nFor 2, this is a job for `npm query`.  We are planning on adding capabilities for it to exit 0 or 1 based on if there were or were not results, and that would address this kind of problem.",
      "Hi @yukukotani sorry for pinging you on an old issue, but what is the reason we didn't update [build-ideal-tree.js](https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/04f53ce13201b460123067d7153f1681342548e1/workspaces/arborist/lib/arborist/build-ideal-tree.js#L213)?\r\n\r\nThe three flags work fine on a fresh install but fail on subsequent runs. I’m not familiar with the npm codebase, but it seems that providing the flags there fixed the issue. Just checking with you if it’s worth fixing.",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6042081297\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6753\n```\n\n\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.0.0\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6753 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.0.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.0.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `10` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@10.0.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.0.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "I don't really have opinions about where it's implemented, only the semantics it has, but it definitely _seems_ like something that only belongs in `npm install` before arborist is invoked?\r\n\r\nConsidering that if i `npm install eslint@=8.8.0`, it installs 8.8.0 right now, *something* is putting `^8.8.0` in package.json, (which is the bug this RFC was meant to fix) and whatever that is, i'd want tweaked. Can you point me to where that is?",

      "I think long-term making `npm install` translate the args the user gives makes more sense than arborist trying to guess.  That's the line we always want to draw: the cli interprets user intent and tells its submodules."

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6435671998\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `release/v9`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r release/v9 -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6708\n```\n\n\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.9.0\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6708 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.9.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.9.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.9.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout release/v9\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/release/v9\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b release/v9 -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v9.9.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

    "body": "\r\n\r\n**Overview:**\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request aims to enhance the asynchronous operation handling in our codebase by leveraging the `Promise.all` method. By using `Promise.all`, we can improve the efficiency and readability of our asynchronous code, leading to better performance and maintainability.\r\n\r\n**Benefits of `Promise.all`:**\r\n\r\n1. **Concurrent Execution:** The `Promise.all` method allows multiple asynchronous operations to run concurrently. This is particularly useful when you have a set of independent tasks that can be executed in parallel, effectively reducing the overall execution time.\r\n\r\n2. **Improved Performance:** By executing multiple promises concurrently, we can take advantage of the underlying hardware's capabilities, making our code more performant, especially in scenarios where we're dealing with numerous network requests or other I/O-bound operations (git).\r\n\r\n3. **Reduced Latency:** When awaiting several independent promises sequentially, the overall time taken is the sum of individual promise execution times. With `Promise.all`, the execution time is determined by the longest-running promise, reducing the total latency.\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes:**\r\n\r\nPlease review the proposed changes and provide feedback. This enhancement using `Promise.all` aligns with best practices for handling asynchronous operations and can lead to improved performance and maintainability in our codebase.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.\r\n",

    "body": "## Summary\r\nThe original issue (#6081) wanted the project's .npmrc to set a prefix value for npm to use in both ```npm prefix``` and ```npm install <package>``` However, we made the changes according to wraithgar's comment.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when running ```npm prefix``` or ```npm install```, there is no error logged communicating to the user that prefix cannot be changed in the project config.\r\n\r\nThis solution gives the error message more clarity to make debugging easier and lets the user know that prefix cannot be changed from the project level.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/npm/cli/assets/122141535/065b9e64-b4b9-4420-aa7b-6938651f5dd0)\r\n\r\nAlso added the accompanying tap test to ensure the expected error is outputted.\r\n\r\n### PLEASE NOTE: \r\n**If prefix is set to a value, the error will be logged anytime a user enters in a npm or npx command, which means that the logging is not specific to just ```npm prefix``` or ```npm install <package>```, but also applies to commands such as ```npm exec```.**\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Reproduce Original Issue:\r\n\r\n1. Add .npmrc file into your project’s directory\r\n2. Set prefix to some location e.g. prefix=./vendor\r\n3. Run ```npm prefix``` or ```npm install <package>```\r\n4. ```npm prefix``` will give the current directory’s prefix, and ```npm install <package>``` will install the package in the current directory.\r\n5. No error would be logged to tell user that prefix cannot be changed from project level\r\n\r\n### File tap test:\r\n- Enter in terminal:\r\n- ```TAP_SNAPSHOT=1 node . run test workspaces/config/test/index.js```\r\n\r\n### Run the entire tap test:\r\n- Enter in terminal:\r\n- ```node . run test```\r\n\r\n### Dummy Project Test:\r\n\r\n- Made a dummy project with a vendor folder and a .npmrc file with prefix=./vendor\r\n- Used aliasing to see if the error is being logged:\r\n- Enter in terminal: \r\n- ```alias localnpm=\"node /workspaces/cli/\"```\r\n- ```localnpm prefix```\r\n- ```localnpm install <package>```\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n  Fixes #6081 \r\n",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/6041100776\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6682\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.0.0-pre.1\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6682 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.0.0-pre.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.0.0-pre.1\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.0.0-pre.1 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10.

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/5673898521\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6673\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v10.0.0-pre.0\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6673 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-10`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@10.0.0-pre.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@10.0.0-pre.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v10.0.0-pre.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-10 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/5590008854\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6650\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.8.1\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6650 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.8.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.8.1\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.8.1 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v9.8.1 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/5579000560\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r release/v8 -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6649\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v8.19.5\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6649 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-8`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@8.19.5` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@8.19.5\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `8` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@8.19.5 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout release/v8\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/release/v8\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b release/v8 -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release -R npm/cli edit v8.19.5 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-8\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-8 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",
      "We're not doing a release for a docs update, just landing the docs."

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/5467419080\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6609\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.8.0\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6609 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.8.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.8.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.8.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release edit v9.8.0 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 11. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "> Windows definitely has symbolic links and has for decades https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links\r\n\r\nHi @ljharb, I mean in the context of this work. It doesn't seem like the NPM packages are utilizing Windows symbolic links. I looked over the changes from Node 16.13.0 to Node 20+... and the same directories were deleted and replaced with these file to directory placeholders.\r\n\r\nseveral lib* directories\r\n\r\nNow my CLI is saying Arborist is not a constructor. It's not loading the classes properly even after reading these simulated symbolic placeholders on Windows. It was working when they were just directories on Node 16.13. I isolated the break between Node 16.13 and Node 16.14 when NPM jumped from:\r\n\r\nnode 16.13.0\r\nnpm 7.24.2\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nnode 16.14.0\r\nnpm 8.3.1\r\n\r\nI have to workaround this with Yarn because I cannot troubleshoot anything on NPM since the CLI is not working when it starts loading the packages.... e.g. \"npm i\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I upgrade Node and NPM... the CLI mostly falls over whenever it tries to traverse the file tree structure with Arborist.",

We now check for a clean git status in during CI in Windows which was previously excluded.\r\n\r\nThe changes required were to:\r\n- Delete our workspace symlinks from node_modules and add a step to resetdeps that will do a platform dependent symlink before the initial reification\r\n- Add line ending normalization to our `.gitattributes` file and commit the result. Git will store text with LF line endings automatically, except for some files like `cmd` scripts that need to be `crlf` and shell scripts that need to be `lf`.\r\n- Update workflows to call `node scripts/resetdeps.js` directly since a fresh clone of the repo wont have any symlinks in place, so any `node .` command will fail due to missing workspaces.\r\n\r\n**Windows Shim Tests**\r\n\r\nThe second commit refactors the shim tests to ensure the `cmd` scripts and all shells are tested in CI. It adds a new CI job that uses 3rd party actions to install WSL and Cygwin so that those can be tested.\r\n\r\nThese new tests would fail without the previous commit since the wrong line endings would cause the scripts to error.\r\n\r\nRef: npm/statusboard#562\r\n",

      "> What version of node is this?\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are asking what version of NodeJS bundled npm with the fix?\r\n\r\n<details><summary>First, the <i>affected versions of npm</i> (click to expand, for details):</summary>\r\n\r\n- We can see this PR's [commit](https://github.com/npm/cli/commit/3a7378d889707d2a4c1f8a6397dda87825e9f5a3) landed in `latest` branch on the 14th of June 2023... and was included in npm 9.7.2 as well as npm 10.0.0.\r\n  - **npm 9.7.2-9.9.0** would appear to be affected ❌, from some quick research, whereas **npm 9.9.1+** have the fix ✅.\r\n    - For npm 9, the fix is indeed present in npm 9.9.1: https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v9.9.1, from the 7th of November 2023.\r\n  - **npm 10.0.0-10.2.1** would appear to be affected :x:, from some quick research, whereas **npm 10.2.2+** have the fix ✅.\r\n    - For npm 10, the fix is present in npm 10.2.2: https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v10.2.2, from the 31st of October 2023.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Then for the <i>NodeJS releases that were at one point affected</i> (click to expand, for details):</summary>\r\n\r\n- **NodeJS 16** and older were never affected ✅, since they shipped older npm that never removed these binstubs.\r\n  - In terms of non-LTS versions of NodeJS, **NodeJS 17** was also never affected ✅, for the same reason.\r\n- **NodeJS 18**: NodeJs 18.8.0 is affected ❌ due to bundling npm 9.8.1 which is affected. The immediate next version NodeJS 18.9.0 and newer are unaffected ✅ due to having npm 10.2.3 or newer, which has the fix.\r\n  - **NodeJS 19** is unaffected ✅, due to never bundling an affected version of npm.\r\n-  **NodeJS 20**: NodeJS 20.4.0-20.9.0 are affected ❌ due to bundling variously npm 9.7.2, 9.8.0, 9.8.1, or 10.1.0, all of which are affected. 20.10.0 and newer are unaffected ✅, due to having npm 10.2.3 which has the fix.\r\n  - **NodeJS 21** had NodeJS 21.0.0 and 21.1.0 affected ❌, due to bunding npm 10.2.0, which is affected. NodeJS 21.2.0 and newer are unaffected ✅, due to having npm 10.2.3 or newer, which has the fix.\r\n- **NodeJS 22** is unaffected ✅, due to bundling npm 10.5.1 or newer, which has the fix.\r\n\r\nReview changelogs from here if you wish to confirm for yourselves: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nAt this point, it appears that only historical NodeJS versions were ever affected, which are all now out of support, and furthermore have been superseded within their respective major versions with a release having the fix.\r\n\r\nThe simplest answer is to update to the latest minor/patch release of a given NodeJS major version if you want to avoid the Yarn 1.x issue. Or else install/use an unaffected version of npm with whatever arbitrary version of NodeJS. For instance, the latest npm (the latest npm 10.x version as of when I'm writing this comment), as well as the latest npm 9.x version, should both be unaffected. (Otherwise, if it is necessary to know the specific versions of npm which are affected, and/or which specific versions of npm were bundled with the various NodeJS versions over time, feel free to expand the sections I wrote above.)\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize... in terms of the **versions of npm that were bundled with various NodeJS releases over time...** which of those were affected?\r\n\r\n- NodeJS 16 and older were never affected ✅.\r\n- NodeJS 17 was never affected ✅.\r\n- NodeJS 18.8.0 is affected ❌ (NodeJS 18.9.0+ not affected ✅)\r\n- NodeJS 19 was never affected ✅.\r\n- NodeJS 20.4.0-20.9.0 are affected ❌ (NodeJS 20.10.0+ not affected ✅).\r\n- NodeJS 21.0.0 and 21.1.0 are affected ❌ (NodeJS 21.2.0+ not affected ✅).\r\n- NodeJS 22 appears unaffected ✅, as of when this comment was posted.\r\n\r\n**Take care that pretty much any version of npm can be installed or used with any version of NodeJS. The actual root determining factor is the npm version -- this comment is only about reviewing which versions of npm were bundled with which versions of NodeJS _by default_, \"out of the box\", for reference purposes.**\r\n\r\n(Any mistakes in this particular comment are mine, and be aware I am not affiliated with and do not represent either of the npm or NodeJS teams.)",

I would expect that v2 should also not be installed. I have raised an issue for it here https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/6441 which also includes a link to minimum reproducible example.\r\n\r\nIn reify under arborist I found a filter condition which runs through the idealTree inventory to see which packages needed to be filtered out when omit dev or omit peer options etc are passed. Along with checking which flag is enabled and which packages is which type it also includes a condition of `node.top.isProjectRoot`. I don't fully understand the purpose of the last condition but am guessing, it is there so that the package is only filtered out if it is going to be directly under the root node_modules folder and not if it is going to be under the node_modules of some package which is under the actual root node_modules folder.

How have you previously installed Node on this machine (and npm if that was installed differently)?\r\n\r\nThis can be merged into `npm`, but I believe it will require coordination with Node in order for this to land and have it work when installing Node on Windows. Currently the Node Windows installers (of which I know very little about) reference `npm.cmd` in the locations below. I'm assuming something similar will need to be done with `npm.ps1` to have it work as expected in these system.\r\n\r\n- [/tools/msvs/msi/nodemsi/product.wxs](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/d2dfdd654ecb9fe340c06a830546977029bf5150/tools/msvs/msi/nodemsi/product.wxs#L221-L235)\r\n- [/tools/msvs/nodevars.bat](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/d2dfdd654ecb9fe340c06a830546977029bf5150/tools/msvs/nodevars.bat#L14)\r\n- [/vcbuild.bat](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/d2dfdd654ecb9fe340c06a830546977029bf5150/vcbuild.bat#L426-L437)\r\n\r\n@mribbons Would you be able to open an issue or PR on https://github.com/nodejs/node to get feedback on how the Windows installers work, and if it would be appropriate for `npm` to ship these `ps1` scripts in our `bin/` dir and have them picked up by the installer?\r\n\r\nAlso in the meantime, would shipping these scripts in the npm bin dir, even if they dont get linked via the Windows installer, fix #6280?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/5336466197\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6534\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.7.2\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6534 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.7.2` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.7.2\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.7.2 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Mark GitHub Release as `latest`\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will make GitHub Releases for the CLI and all workspaces, but GitHub has UI affordances for which release should appear as the \"latest\", which should always be the CLI. To mark the CLI release as latest run this command:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh release edit v9.7.2 --latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10.

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/5193567906\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6529\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.7.1\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6529 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.7.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.7.1\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.7.1 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step.

      "@lukekarrys does this PR change the fundamental message of the package?\r\n> It does the management of configuration files that npm uses, but importantly, does _not_ define all the configuration defaults or types, as those parts make more sense to live within the npm CLI itself.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for the best approach to move from `libnpmconfig` to `@npmcli/config` for a use case where we download packages via `pacote` and want to ensure to take the user configuration into account.",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/5136462619\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6470\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.7.0\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6470 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.7.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.7.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.7.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",
      "`npm@9.7.0` was published but never tagged `latest` due to a bug found during step 4. below is a root cause of the bug, but the `tl;dr` is that `npm@9.7.0` will be deprecated and `npm@9.7.1` will be published once the bug is fixed.\r\n\r\nwe switched from `read-package-json` to `@npmcli/package-json` which recently received an update to bring all the features from the former to the latter. lost in this port was a minor change to normalizing package bins. previously we would not parse `package.json#directories.bin` if a `package.json#bin` was present (ref: https://github.com/npm/read-package-json/blob/main/lib/read-json.js#L351-L353) but now we do regardless of whether a bin object is there (ref: https://github.com/npm/package-json/blob/main/lib/normalize.js#L161)\r\n\r\n**next steps:**\r\n- deprecate `npm@9.7.`. this version exists on the registry and contains breaking changes that would impact users if you publish packages using both `bin` and `directories.bin`\r\n- make a fix for this bug in `@npmcli/package.json`\r\n- do a further analysis of the changes between `read-package-json` and `@npmcli/package-json`  and assert this behavior in news tests to ensure no other breaking changes occurred\r\n- do a new release for `npm@9.7.1`",

Maybe I misunderstood?",

This code as it is brings prereleases under the umbrella for the semver major for which they are a prerelease.\r\n\r\nWhether or not this makes sense anymore is probably something we should discuss for npm 10.",
      "In my opinion, the pre-release version should be included when checking the version information, so `engines` value is `>=16.0.0` `nodeVersion` value is `v21.0.0-nightly20230429c968361829` is satisfied, no unspported message is printed, The effect is consistent with the current npm version.\r\n\r\nI think using the `includePrerelease` option has the same effect as currently using string replacement. However, according to your comments, it seems that there are other considerations, which may need to be discussed and confirmed by you.",
      "Did some actual testing now that it's the morning and not the weekend.\r\n\r\nFor things above the floor in in a `>` range, this PR doesn't change any behavior.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n> semver.satisfies('21.0.0-beta', '^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0')\r\nfalse\r\n> semver.satisfies('21.0.0-beta', '^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0', { includePrerelease: true })\r\ntrue\r\n> semver.satisfies('21.0.0', '^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0', { includePrerelease: true })\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever for things just below it, it does\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n> semver.satisfies('18.0.0-beta', '^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0')\r\nfalse\r\n> semver.satisfies('18.0.0-beta', '^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0', { includePrerelease: true })\r\nfalse\r\n> semver.satisfies('18.0.0', '^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0')\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this can't happen in any event without a breaking change.  This particular code is some of the oldest in npm, and what it effectively does is bring prereleases for a given supported node version under \"support\".\r\n\r\nI'll add a bullet point to revisit this to the npm 10 planning but this PR isn't going to be something that works because of the examples given above.",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/5007998433\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6429\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.6.7\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6429 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.6.7` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.6.7\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.6.7 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

These publish requests are kicked off eagerly in parallel, and so it is currently not possible to reconcile the logs to their originating package.\r\n\r\nThe presence of this URL data would allow me to easily differentiate between packages which were published with provenance and those which weren't, as well as recreate the log on the lerna side.\r\n\r\nFor now the best I can do via log interception is gather up the unique URLs and print them at the very end:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"688\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/900523/236454696-c15859dd-d918-4509-acf9-c40405e4cd99.png\">\r\n\r\nI have gone for a rather rudimentary \"bolt it on the npmFetch response\" approach here, but it would definitely get me what I need.

      "> adding an additional network request location to npm feels like a breaking change to me; lots of places that run npm will lock down network traffic to known servers)\r\n\r\n@ljharb this is good context, makes sense that you might lock down network traffic around npm.\r\n\r\nThis change should not add any more network requests to `audit signatures` as we've already implemented [attestation verification support in `pacote`](https://github.com/npm/pacote/pull/259/files) that perform the same network requests there to update the Sigstore trust root (this [now includes npm's public keys](https://github.com/sigstore/root-signing/blob/main/staging/repository/targets/registry.npmjs.org/7a8ec9678ad824cdccaa7a6dc0961caf8f8df61bc7274189122c123446248426.keys.json)) 😬\r\n\r\nWould have been good to surface this at the time, but I'm also not aware of any complaints around the pacote change so this might mean the `audit signatures` command still hasn't gotten a lot of usage. \r\n\r\nGood to surface all these constraints before we consider turning some of these checks on by default when running `npm audit`.\r\n",
      "People largely don’t run anything that’s not run by default; I’d urge you to consider setting up an npm registry endpoint for this rather than forcing clients to connect independently to sigstore.",
      "> I wonder, would we want to make the same change to pacote so it re-uses the same cache?\r\n\r\n@feelepxyz I've got a `pacote` [PR](https://github.com/npm/pacote/pull/278) open with the changes necessary to use a consistent TUF cache between the two uses cases.",
      "To reiterate, any CI that’s using something like https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner will immediately fail when npm audit runs (including 400+ of my packages), so this will be a very disruptive breaking change if it’s by default.",
      "Again, this doesn't run on audit. This is part of `npm audit signatures`.",
      "ahh, thanks, i misunderstood that - I thought this PR was affecting `npm audit` itself. Appreciate the clarification.",
      "The pacote PR that added the tuf cache param parsing landed and is published.",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4875876129\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6395\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.6.6\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6395 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.6.6` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.6.6\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.6.6 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "@wlynch this is very exciting! Finally had some time to review this. I think we should also give the SLSA team some time to chime in here.\r\n\r\nPart of me also wonders if we should just got to SLSA 1.0 for GitLab from the get go and write up a spec for this in the official repo [like was done for GHA](https://github.com/slsa-framework/github-actions-buildtypes/tree/main/workflow/v1). This would simplify our lives a bit on the npm registry as we would only need support 3 different predicate types for GitLab when rendering the UI (1.0) + GitHub (SLSA 0.2 + 1.0). \r\n\r\nGoing to figure out if we can add support for SLSA 1.0 in the next few weeks, maybe up to a month.",

This is what was used during beta testing of the GitHub provenance generation and I am hoping it can prove useful to GitLab's testing.\r\n\r\nOnce this PR lands folks can `npm install -g npm/cli#provenance` and get the code as y'all are helping to refine it.  This is a way folks can test e2e in a real environment.\r\n\r\nThis will also lower the barrier to what is \"acceptable\" to land. We don't have to land the 100% finished product all at once, and we can have a little more wiggle room in case we need to make \"breaking\" changes in the branch before then.",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4748006572\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6347\n```\n\n\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.6.5\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6347 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.6.5` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.6.5\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.6.5 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4619273765\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6315\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.6.4\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6315 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.6.4` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.6.4\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.6.4 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "I think this is only a partial solution, since the `nopt` library will still parse subsequent flags as arguments to the previous flag if it could take a string argument.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```shell\r\nnpm publish --provenance --access public\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case `--access` would get treated as an argument to the `--provenance` flag rather than assigning `--provenance` a `true` value and processing `--access` as a separate flag.\r\n\r\nSo there is still some work to be done upstream in the `nopt` library.",
      "Before I close this I want to thank @ianlewis for their work pushing to get this fixed/shipped.  In other issues and this one they and other have pointed out that this param overloading isn't exactly standard practice.  Beyond that `nopt` can't even handle it properly and that would be another bug to track down.\r\n\r\nWhat npm really needs is a mechanism in the config to \"couple\" two configs together to act as this de facto \"boolean or string\"  @bdehamer is going to write up a quick EDR issue in statusboard for this so we can spec it out and get it done.  `browser` `expect-entries` and `provenance` all need this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I'm closing this in anticipation of a better path, to be worked on very soon, not because this PR was lacking in quality or effort.",

      "> Is this really the best long-term plan, to use the ESM-only version?\r\n\r\nAll things being equal, if `chalk` supported `CJS` and `ESM` this PR would use the `CJS` version. But using the `ESM` version here was a trivial part of this PR, and most everything else would have been done the same regardless of its export type.\r\n\r\nThe differentiating factor is wanting to use `chalk-template`. I'm sure other options exist for that problem, but in this case we were already using `chalk` and the only breaking change for the CLI is its export type. We are already choosing to use lazy requires in other places, so the `import` in this case pretty closely matches that behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR standardizes our use of terminal coloring even more, making it easier in the future to switch off of `chalk` if necessary. But I don't see any reason to do that in the future, nor do I see a problem with consuming an ESM only dependency if it fits within the CLI's dependency loading constraints.",
      "We can't use ESM modules in npm right now.  This is the same problem that we had when we had lazy loading, and npm could not reliably install itself globally (especially in windows) because the code it required in later steps was gone by the time it was being required.\r\n\r\nUnless we can have a mechanism to totally block all reification until all esm imports are done or have thrown this is a problem.  This is admittedly a problem unique to npm, because other modules use npm to install themselves globaly. npm has to be able to do it to itself.\r\n\r\nUntil we solve that problem esm imports in npm can not happen.",
      "Converting to a draft until progress is made on testing lazy requires when installing npm globally with itself.",
      "Marking this as ready for review after rebasing against `latest`. I also pushed a new `chore` commit bumping the `@npmcli/smoke-tests` version to force those tests to run as part of this PR.",
      "> Until we solve that problem esm imports in npm can not happen.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses an [`import()` expression](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#import-expressions) to load `chalk` which is itself using [`import` specifiers](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#import-specifiers). This means that when it does `import('chalk@5')` the only difference from `require('chalk@4')` is that the expression is returning a `Promise`. As long as that expression is awaited, then we can guarantee that all `import` specifiers in `chalk` have run through all phases (loading, linking, evaluating) of the async module loading process.\r\n\r\nThis means the danger in using `import()` expressions in npm today is the same as using `require` below the top level of a CommonJS file. We have to make sure that the code being required/imported is in place on disk (or in the cache in the case of require) when those statements are run. Now that we have a test for that (#6491) I believe this PR is ok to land.\r\n\r\n**A side note on testing:**\r\nIn order to be sure this PR passed the new test, I forced a version bump of the local `@npmcli/smoke-tests` workspace so they would run. In the future I think we can continue running those tests only as part of the release PR creation process.",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4567869952\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6278\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.6.3\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6278 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.6.3` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.6.3\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.6.3 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4420312785\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6256\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.6.2\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6256 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.6.2` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.6.2\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.6.2 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4367487240\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6230\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.6.1\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6230 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.6.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.6.1\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.6.1 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [x] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4312180936\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6217\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.6.0\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6217 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.6.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.6.0\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.6.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [x] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4244055956\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6190\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.5.1\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6190 --force\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI and workspaces\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces to `latest`, `prerelease` or `backport` depending on their version, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.5.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.5.1\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.5.1 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    ```\n\n    ```sh\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step. These are done once this PR has been labelled with `autorelease: tagged`.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    First, sync our fork of node with the upstream source:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    ```\n\n    Then, if we are opening a PR against the latest version of node:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    For example, this will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v16.x-staging` branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=16\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4176372609\n\n#### Force CI to Rerun for This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `main`. To force CI to rerun, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r release/v8\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v8.19.4\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6165 --force\n    node . run resetdeps\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-8`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@8.19.4` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@8.19.4\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `8` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@8.19.4 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    git checkout release/v8\n    git fetch\n    git reset --hard origin/release/v8\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b release/v8 -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-8\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    ```sh\n    # This will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v18.x-staging` branch\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-8 -f branch=18\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10.

      "I work with npm 6 but not in the javascript/node ecosystem. At work, we have leveraged npm to manage our packages because our language doesn't have a package manager. We use a lot of binary calls in the postinstall script. What I have noticed is that the .bin folder is not deleted during an npm ci.\r\n\r\nFrom investigating npm 9, it seems that .bin is deleted.\r\n\r\nWhere are the relevant lines of code for npm 6?",
      "As to an example for npm 6, I tried using preinstall script and postinstall script to show the state of node_modules, but the state look the same.\r\n\r\nI know during npm ci, a file that should have been installed is not yet located in node_modules. The workaround for npm 6 is `npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm ci`. The first `npm ci` call creates the needed .bin folder/files, and the second npm ci call does not fail at the postinstall of a dependency.",
      "I thought of a way to test if the .bin folder is deleted during an `npm ci`. I create a file in the .bin folder and then check if it was deleted after calling `npm ci`. For npm@6.14.17, the file was not deleted, implying the .bin folder was not deleted. For npm@9.5.0, the .bin folder is deleted. I stand by the modifications I made to the documentation for npm@6. Note that this Pull Request is to update npm@6 documentation and not npm@9\r\n\r\nSimple script:\r\n```shell\r\nnpm -v\r\nnpm init -y\r\nnpm i pacakge_that_puts_something_in_.bin_folder\r\nls node_modules/.bin/\r\ntouch node_modules/.bin/_TEST_FILE\r\nnpm ci\r\nls node_modules/.bin/\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
      "> Note that this Pull Request is to update npm@6 documentation and not npm@9\r\n\r\nThank you for clarifying and for the PR. I did miss that during my initial review. `npm@6` is currently only released for security updates currently, so unfortunately we can't merge this PR even for a minor docs update."

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4117952082\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli -f release-pr=6140\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.4.2\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6140 --force\n    node . run resetdeps\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.4.2` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.4.2\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.4.2 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    git checkout latest\n    git fetch\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    ```sh\n    # This will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v18.x-staging` branch\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=18\n    ```\n\n- [x] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4069792471\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.4.1\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6117 --force\n    node . run resetdeps\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.4.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.4.1\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.4.1 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    git checkout latest\n    git fetch\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    ```sh\n    # This will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v18.x-staging` branch\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=18\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Label and fast-track `nodejs/node` PR\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > This requires being a `nodejs` collaborator. Currently @lukekarrys is so ping them to do these steps!\n\n    - Thumbs-up reaction on the Fast-track comment\n    - Add an LGTM / Approval\n    - Add `request-ci` label to get it running CI\n    - Add `commit-queue` label once everything is green",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/4009828340\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest -R npm/cli\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.4.0\n\n- [ ] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6089 --force\n    node . run resetdeps\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 3. Publish the CLI\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.4.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.4.0\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.4.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 6. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 7. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    git checkout latest\n    git fetch\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. Wait For Release Tags\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > The remaining steps all require the GitHub tags and releases to be created first.\n\n    Release Please will run on the just merged release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package. The release bot will will comment on this PR when the releases and tags are created.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The release workflow also includes the Node integration tests which do not need to finish before continuing.\n\n    You can watch the release workflow in your terminal with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -R npm/cli -w release -b latest -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 9. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    ```sh\n    # This will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v18.x-staging` branch\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=18\n    ```",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/3915182389\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest\n```\n\n\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.3.1\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 6055 --force\n    node . run resetdeps\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.3.1` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.3.1\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.3.1 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    git checkout latest\n    git fetch\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Check For Release Tags\n\n    Release Please will run on the just pushed release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package.\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -w release -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. [Post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/home)\n\n    ```text\n    New @npmjs release: 9.3.1!\n\n    https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v9.3.1\n\n    Release details...\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [x] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    ```sh\n    # This will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v18.x-staging` branch\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=18\n    ```",

It also updates the code, tests, documentation, and configuration files of the npm cli project to use the `mock-globals` package and to improve the quality and compatibility of the code. Additionally, it adds a new GitHub Actions workflow to run linting and testing for the `mock-globals` package, and a new `.eslintrc.local.js` file to enforce es6 syntax and restrict require statements for certain files.\r\n​\r\n<!--\ncopilot:poem\n-->\n### <samp>🤖 Generated by Copilot at 5ef6c04</samp>\n\n> _We're the crew of the npm cli_\n> _We work on code and docs with glee_\n> _We mock the

    "body": "### Refactor Config Reading During `exec`\r\n\r\nThis removes the previous workarounds that were required due to tests\r\nsetting configs that were not available in the constructor of the\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nThis also made the fix for https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/45881\r\neasier since the config checks for workspaces can now all be made in the\r\ncommand. The fix was to move the package.json detection to\r\n`@npmcli/config` and use that boolean instead of setting\r\n`location=project` which affected all commands such as `config set`\r\nsaving to the wrong location.\r\n\r\nSome notable changes from this refactor include:\r\n-  `execWorkspaces` no longer being passed the raw workspace filters and\r\n    instead requiring `this.setWorkspaces()` to be called which was\r\n    already being done in most commands\r\n- `static workspaces = [true|false]` on all commands to indicate\r\n  workspaces support. This is used in docs generation and whether to\r\n  throw when `execWorkspaces` is called or not.\r\n\r\n### Drop `fakeMockNpm` and refactor `mockNpm`\r\n\r\nThis refactor also drops `fakeMockNpm` in favor of `realMockNpm` (now\r\njust `mockNpm`), and adds new features to `mockNpm`.\r\n\r\nSome new features of `mockNpm`:\r\n\r\n- sets all configs via argv so they are parsed before `npm.load()`. This\r\n  is the most important change as it more closely resembles real usage.\r\n- automatically resets `process.exitCode`\r\n- automatically puts global `node_modules` in correct testdir based on platform\r\n- more helpful error messages when used in unsupported ways\r\n- ability to preload a command for execution\r\n- calls `process.chdir` automatically to `prefix` and sets `globalPrefix` to the\r\n  specified global testdir\r\n\r\n### Misc Fixes\r\n\r\nDuring the test refactor I uncovered some bugs that were also fixed or features\r\nthat were made easier to implement\r\n\r\n- `npm fund --which` wasn't validated properly\r\n- `npm init -w path/ws` was writng `\\\\` separators to package.json on windows\r\n- `npm view` now uses `npm.output` instead of `console.log`\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n\r\nThis also removes some of the one off linting rules that were set in the\r\npast to reduce churn and fixes all remaining errors.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- fix: evaluate configs in command class\r\n- fix: generate workspace support for docs pages\r\n- fix(fund): correctly parse and use `which` config\r\n- fix: refactor `help` to use `@npmcli/promise-spawn`\r\n- fix(init): write package.json workspaces paths with / separators\r\n- fix(view): convert command to use output instead of console\r\n- chore: convert ls test to mockNpm\r\n- chore: convert diff test to mock npm and registry\r\n- chore: convert all test to `mockNpm`\r\n- chore: use chdir for mockNpm\r\n",

From the [docs repo](https://github.com/npm/help-docs), pull down any changes that have been made to content in the docs repo and then push to trigger an automatic update of the CLI documentation :\r\n\r\n    ```sh\r\n    git fetch --all\r\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\r\n    git commit -avm \"emptiness\" --allow-empty\r\n    ```\r\n1. Enter your GPG key.\r\n\r\n    ```sh\r\n    git push origin +latest:deploy-staging\r\n    git push origin +latest:deploy-production\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Post the release notes to [Github Releases](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases). Make sure to remove extra newlines from the original, to preserve text flow in browsers.\r\n1. Post the release notes to [npm.community #announcements](https://npm.community/c/announcements).\r\n1. The release manager tweets about the new release!\r\n1. Post a link on [the npmjs tumblog](http://blog.npmjs.org).\r\n",

      "## Release Manager\n\nRelease workflow run: https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/runs/3904834260\n\n#### Force CI to Update This Release\n\nThis PR will be updated and CI will run for every non-`chore:` commit that is pushed to `latest`. To force CI to update this PR, run this command:\n\n```\ngh workflow run release.yml -r latest\n```\n\n### Release Checklist for v9.3.0\n\n- [x] 1. Checkout the release branch\n\n    Ensure git status is not dirty on this branch after resetting deps. If it is, then something is probably wrong with the automated release process.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checkout 5974 --force\n    node . run resetdeps\n    node scripts/git-dirty.js\n    ```\n\n- [x] 2. Check CI status\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr checks --watch\n    ```\n\n- [x] 3. Publish the CLI\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > This will publish all updated workspaces, and will publish the CLI with the dist-tag set to `next-9`.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The `--test` argument can optionally be omitted to run the publish process without running any tests locally.\n\n    ```sh\n    node scripts/publish.js --test\n    ```\n\n- [x] 4. Optionally install and test `npm@9.3.0` locally\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i -g npm@9.3.0\n    npm --version\n    npm whoami\n    npm help install\n    # etc\n    ```\n\n- [x] 5. Set `latest` `dist-tag` to newly published version\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > NOT FOR PRERELEASE: Do not run this step for prereleases or if `9` is not being set to `latest`.\n\n    ```sh\n    node . dist-tag add npm@9.3.0 latest\n    ```\n\n- [x] 6. Merge release PR\n\n    ```sh\n    gh pr merge --rebase\n    git checkout latest\n    git fetch\n    git reset --hard origin/latest\n    node . run resetdeps\n    ```\n\n- [x] 7. Check For Release Tags\n\n    Release Please will run on the just pushed release commit and create GitHub releases and tags for each package.\n\n    ```\n    gh run watch `gh run list -w release -L 1 --json databaseId -q \".[0].databaseId\"`\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 8. [Post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/home)\n\n    ```text\n    New @npmjs release: 9.3.0!\n\n    https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v9.3.0\n\n    Release details...\n    ```\n\n- [x] 9. Trigger `docs.npmjs.com` update\n\n    ```sh\n    gh workflow run update-cli.yml --repo npm/documentation\n    ```\n\n- [ ] 10. Open `nodejs/node` PR to update `npm` to latest\n\n    > **Warning**:\n    > You must wait for CI to create the release tags before running this step.\n\n    Trigger the [**Create Node PR** action](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/create-node-pr.yml). This will open a PR on `nodejs/node` to the `main` branch.\n\n    > **Note**:\n    > The resulting PR *may* need to be labelled if it is not intended to land on old Node versions.\n\n    ```sh\n    gh repo sync npm/node --source nodejs/node --force\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9\n    ```\n\n    If the PR should be opened on a different branch (such as when doing backports) then run it with `-f branch=<BRANCH_NAME>`. There is also a shortcut to target a specific Node version by specifying a major version number with `-f branch=18` (or similar).\n\n    ```sh\n    # This will create a PR on nodejs/node to the `v18.x-staging` branch\n    gh workflow run create-node-pr.yml -f spec=next-9 -f branch=18\n    ```",

I had pushed some commits to that PR but backed them out to make it clear that this is a different approach to the same issue.\r\n\r\nThis also includes two chore commits to refactor the tests. If the `fix:` from this PR doesn't get merged, I will make a few PR with only those chores.\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant message from the `fix` commit:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis follows a similar approach to local and global bins that already\r\nexist. This is achieved by linking a packages own bin script to\r\n`node_modules/.bin` and the package within `node_modules/` similar to if\r\nit had been installed with `--install-links=false`.\r\n\r\nThen the linked bin is run and the symlinks are cleaned up immediately\r\nafter. This has the same effect as loading the current package into the\r\n`npx` cache and running it, except it is quicker to not have to run any\r\nArborist commands.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Commits**:\r\n- chore: add option for strict mock registry\r\n- fix(npx): link and run own bins directly when possible\r\n- chore(libnpmexec): refactor tests to use mock registry\r\n",

I\r\n  had originally moved them out of devDeps as part of #5309, but this\r\n  seems to go against the grain of other tooling. We would have to special\r\n  case both `audit` and `licensee` to run on a custom subset of our\r\n  dependency tree.\r\n\r\n  Maybe one day when all tools can be piped the output of an `npm query`\r\n  this will be possible. It would be nice if we could only audit\r\n  dependencies that are bundled as part of the CLI.\r\n\r\n  But for now it's easier to move these to devDeps and then reinstall only\r\n  the docs workspace after pruning during the publish step.\r\n\r\n- chore: licensee@9.0.0\r\n\r\n- chore: remove mdx from docs build\r\n\r\n  We will be updating to mdx@2 soon which is esm only, but built in to\r\n  Gatsby. Due to the new documentation build process here and in\r\n  `npm/documentation`, there is much less need for us to verify all our\r\n  docs here. Therefore, it is best to remove this dependency now to avoid\r\n  needing to update it here at the same time as the docs site.",

This will enable\n  for easier migration to eventually only using the tarball contents.\n\n`scripts/publish.js`\n\n- Replaces `make publish`\n- Will publish all workspaces that need to be published, before\n  publishing the CLI.\n- Makes running tests an optional part of the script, since CI now runs\n  the tests.\n- Can optionally only pack the tarball, for use in CI to test installing\n  the tarball.\n\n`scripts/util.js`\n\n- Shared utilities for spawning commands including helpers for `npm` and\n  `gh`.\n- Common interface for running, parsing args, logging, and debugging\n  of scripts.\n",

Previously `npm` would output all json formatted errors on stderr, making it difficult to parse as the stderr stream usually has logs already written to it. In the future, `npm` will differentiate between errors and crashes. Errors, such as `E404` and `ERESOLVE`, will be handled and will continue to be output on stdout. In the case of a crash, `npm` will log the error as usual but will not attempt to display it as json, even in `--json` mode. Moving a case from the category of an error to a crash will not be considered a breaking change. For more information see npm/rfcs#482.\n* `npm config set` will no longer accept deprecated or invalid config options.\n* `timing` and `loglevel` changes\n    - `timing` has been removed as a value for `--loglevel`\n    - `--timing` will show timing information regardless of\n      `--loglevel`, except when `--silent`\n* deprecate boolean install flags in favor of `--install-strategy`\n    * deprecate --global-style, --global now sets --install-strategy=shallow\n    * deprecate --legacy-bundling, now sets --install-strategy=nested\n* npm will no longer attempt to modify ownership of files it creates\n* this package no longer attempts to change file ownership automatically\n* this package no longer attempts to change file ownership automatically\n\n### Features\n\n*

It doesn't solve everything (I didn't address the registry URLs issue, and sorting differs slightly when there are `~` or `^`), but it aligns this more closely with what Yarn produces.

Its prerelease versions have been thoroughly tested by a wide number of users, and I think it's finally ready for &quot;actual&quot; release, for use in the mythical &quot;production&quot;.</p>\n<p>The breaking changes introduced here are mostly originating from the v1 CST parser having become a rather difficult beast to work with. So it's here rewritten pretty much completely, now with a lexer as a first stage. Along the way, the whole project was rewritten in TypeScript and the export paths and options refactored pretty deeply.</p>\n<p>If you've been using the library just via its <code>parse()</code>, <code>parseDocument()</code> and <code>stringify()</code> functions, then it's quite likely that none of the changes affect your experience in any way. However, if you've been doing something more involved, then I would strongly recommend that you review the library's <a href=\"https://eemeli.org/yaml/\">documentation site</a> for the v2 docs.</p>\n<p>Going forward, it's finally time to start experimenting with new YAML spec features that may eventually be included in <a href=\"https://github.com/yaml/yaml-spec/\">YAML 1.3 and later</a>. Those will be made available by specifying the <code>version: 'next'</code> option. However, beware!

Its prerelease versions have been thoroughly tested by a wide number of users, and I think it's finally ready for &quot;actual&quot; release, for use in the mythical &quot;production&quot;.</p>\n<p>The breaking changes introduced here are mostly originating from the v1 CST parser having become a rather difficult beast to work with. So it's here rewritten pretty much completely, now with a lexer as a first stage. Along the way, the whole project was rewritten in TypeScript and the export paths and options refactored pretty deeply.</p>\n<p>If you've been using the library just via its <code>parse()</code>, <code>parseDocument()</code> and <code>stringify()</code> functions, then it's quite likely that none of the changes affect your experience in any way. However, if you've been doing something more involved, then I would strongly recommend that you review the library's <a href=\"https://eemeli.org/yaml/\">documentation site</a> for the v2 docs.</p>\n<p>Going forward, it's finally time to start experimenting with new YAML spec features that may eventually be included in <a href=\"https://github.com/yaml/yaml-spec/\">YAML 1.3 and later</a>. Those will be made available by specifying the <code>version: 'next'</code> option. However, beware! Any features available this way may be removed or have their API broken by any <strong>minor</strong> release of this library, and no compatibility guarantees with other libraries are given. In general, semver compatibility is guaranteed for features that are explicitly included in the documentation; everything else should be considered as internal implementation details.</p>\n<p>The following is an overview of the breaking changes and new features introduced in each of the prerelease steps leading up to this release; the individual releases' notes and the PRs will contain more detail, along with specific migration guides.</p>\n<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-0\">v2.0.0-0</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop deprecated end points, members, options &amp; defaults (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/171\">#171</a>)</li>\n<li>Breaking changes to Document &amp; createNode APIs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/186\">#186</a>)</li>\n<li>When creating a mapping from a JS Object, drop undefined values (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/173\">#173</a>)</li>\n<li>Retain existing nodes when using <code>set()</code> in mappings &amp; sequences (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/185\">#185</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-1\">v2.0.0-1</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve JSON compatibility (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/189\">#189</a>)</li>\n<li>Refactor tag <code>resolve()</code> API (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/201\">#201</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Its prerelease versions have been thoroughly tested by a wide number of users, and I think it's finally ready for &quot;actual&quot; release, for use in the mythical &quot;production&quot;.</p>\n<p>The breaking changes introduced here are mostly originating from the v1 CST parser having become a rather difficult beast to work with. So it's here rewritten pretty much completely, now with a lexer as a first stage. Along the way, the whole project was rewritten in TypeScript and the export paths and options refactored pretty deeply.</p>\n<p>If you've been using the library just via its <code>parse()</code>, <code>parseDocument()</code> and <code>stringify()</code> functions, then it's quite likely that none of the changes affect your experience in any way. However, if you've been doing something more involved, then I would strongly recommend that you review the library's <a href=\"https://eemeli.org/yaml/\">documentation site</a> for the v2 docs.</p>\n<p>Going forward, it's finally time to start experimenting with new YAML spec features that may eventually be included in <a href=\"https://github.com/yaml/yaml-spec/\">YAML 1.3 and later</a>. Those will be made available by specifying the <code>version: 'next'</code> option. However, beware! Any features available this way may be removed or have their API broken by any <strong>minor</strong> release of this library, and no compatibility guarantees with other libraries are given. In general, semver compatibility is guaranteed for features that are explicitly included in the documentation; everything else should be considered as internal implementation details.</p>\n<p>The following is an overview of the breaking changes and new features introduced in each of the prerelease steps leading up to this release; the individual releases' notes and the PRs will contain more detail, along with specific migration guides.</p>\n<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-0\">v2.0.0-0</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop deprecated end points, members, options &amp; defaults (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/171\">#171</a>)</li>\n<li>Breaking changes to Document &amp; createNode APIs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/186\">#186</a>)</li>\n<li>When creating a mapping from a JS Object, drop undefined values (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/173\">#173</a>)</li>\n<li>Retain existing nodes when using <code>set()</code> in mappings &amp; sequences (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/185\">#185</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-1\">v2.0.0-1</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve JSON compatibility (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/189\">#189</a>)</li>\n<li>Refactor tag <code>resolve()</code> API (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/201\">#201</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-3\">v2.0.0-3</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop <code>'yaml/parse-cst'</code> endpoint (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/223\">#223</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Its prerelease versions have been thoroughly tested by a wide number of users, and I think it's finally ready for &quot;actual&quot; release, for use in the mythical &quot;production&quot;.</p>\n<p>The breaking changes introduced here are mostly originating from the v1 CST parser having become a rather difficult beast to work with. So it's here rewritten pretty much completely, now with a lexer as a first stage. Along the way, the whole project was rewritten in TypeScript and the export paths and options refactored pretty deeply.</p>\n<p>If you've been using the library just via its <code>parse()</code>, <code>parseDocument()</code> and <code>stringify()</code> functions, then it's quite likely that none of the changes affect your experience in any way. However, if you've been doing something more involved, then I would strongly recommend that you review the library's <a href=\"https://eemeli.org/yaml/\">documentation site</a> for the v2 docs.</p>\n<p>Going forward, it's finally time to start experimenting with new YAML spec features that may eventually be included in <a href=\"https://github.com/yaml/yaml-spec/\">YAML 1.3 and later</a>. Those will be made available by specifying the <code>version: 'next'</code> option. However, beware! Any features available this way may be removed or have their API broken by any <strong>minor</strong> release of this library, and no compatibility guarantees with other libraries are given. In general, semver compatibility is guaranteed for features that are explicitly included in the documentation; everything else should be considered as internal implementation details.</p>\n<p>The following is an overview of the breaking changes and new features introduced in each of the prerelease steps leading up to this release; the individual releases' notes and the PRs will contain more detail, along with specific migration guides.</p>\n<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-0\">v2.0.0-0</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop deprecated end points, members, options &amp; defaults (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/171\">#171</a>)</li>\n<li>Breaking changes to Document &amp; createNode APIs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/186\">#186</a>)</li>\n<li>When creating a mapping from a JS Object, drop undefined values (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/173\">#173</a>)</li>\n<li>Retain existing nodes when using <code>set()</code> in mappings &amp; sequences (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/185\">#185</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-1\">v2.0.0-1</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve JSON compatibility (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/189\">#189</a>)</li>\n<li>Refactor tag <code>resolve()</code> API (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/201\">#201</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-3\">v2.0.0-3</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop <code>'yaml/parse-cst'</code> endpoint (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/223\">#223</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Its prerelease versions have been thoroughly tested by a wide number of users, and I think it's finally ready for &quot;actual&quot; release, for use in the mythical &quot;production&quot;.</p>\n<p>The breaking changes introduced here are mostly originating from the v1 CST parser having become a rather difficult beast to work with. So it's here rewritten pretty much completely, now with a lexer as a first stage. Along the way, the whole project was rewritten in TypeScript and the export paths and options refactored pretty deeply.</p>\n<p>If you've been using the library just via its <code>parse()</code>, <code>parseDocument()</code> and <code>stringify()</code> functions, then it's quite likely that none of the changes affect your experience in any way. However, if you've been doing something more involved, then I would strongly recommend that you review the library's <a href=\"https://eemeli.org/yaml/\">documentation site</a> for the v2 docs.</p>\n<p>Going forward, it's finally time to start experimenting with new YAML spec features that may eventually be included in <a href=\"https://github.com/yaml/yaml-spec/\">YAML 1.3 and later</a>. Those will be made available by specifying the <code>version: 'next'</code> option. However, beware! Any features available this way may be removed or have their API broken by any <strong>minor</strong> release of this library, and no compatibility guarantees with other libraries are given. In general, semver compatibility is guaranteed for features that are explicitly included in the documentation; everything else should be considered as internal implementation details.</p>\n<p>The following is an overview of the breaking changes and new features introduced in each of the prerelease steps leading up to this release; the individual releases' notes and the PRs will contain more detail, along with specific migration guides.</p>\n<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-0\">v2.0.0-0</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop deprecated end points, members, options &amp; defaults (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/171\">#171</a>)</li>\n<li>Breaking changes to Document &amp; createNode APIs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/186\">#186</a>)</li>\n<li>When creating a mapping from a JS Object, drop undefined values (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/173\">#173</a>)</li>\n<li>Retain existing nodes when using <code>set()</code> in mappings &amp; sequences (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/185\">#185</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-1\">v2.0.0-1</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve JSON compatibility (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/189\">#189</a>)</li>\n<li>Refactor tag <code>resolve()</code> API (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/201\">#201</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-3\">v2.0.0-3</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop <code>'yaml/parse-cst'</code> endpoint (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/223\">#223</a>)</li>\n<li>Update build configs &amp; minimum supported versions (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/224\">#224</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-4\">v2.0.0-4</a></h4>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Its prerelease versions have been thoroughly tested by a wide number of users, and I think it's finally ready for &quot;actual&quot; release, for use in the mythical &quot;production&quot;.</p>\n<p>The breaking changes introduced here are mostly originating from the v1 CST parser having become a rather difficult beast to work with. So it's here rewritten pretty much completely, now with a lexer as a first stage. Along the way, the whole project was rewritten in TypeScript and the export paths and options refactored pretty deeply.</p>\n<p>If you've been using the library just via its <code>parse()</code>, <code>parseDocument()</code> and <code>stringify()</code> functions, then it's quite likely that none of the changes affect your experience in any way. However, if you've been doing something more involved, then I would strongly recommend that you review the library's <a href=\"https://eemeli.org/yaml/\">documentation site</a> for the v2 docs.</p>\n<p>Going forward, it's finally time to start experimenting with new YAML spec features that may eventually be included in <a href=\"https://github.com/yaml/yaml-spec/\">YAML 1.3 and later</a>. Those will be made available by specifying the <code>version: 'next'</code> option. However, beware! Any features available this way may be removed or have their API broken by any <strong>minor</strong> release of this library, and no compatibility guarantees with other libraries are given. In general, semver compatibility is guaranteed for features that are explicitly included in the documentation; everything else should be considered as internal implementation details.</p>\n<p>The following is an overview of the breaking changes and new features introduced in each of the prerelease steps leading up to this release; the individual releases' notes and the PRs will contain more detail, along with specific migration guides.</p>\n<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-0\">v2.0.0-0</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop deprecated end points, members, options &amp; defaults (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/171\">#171</a>)</li>\n<li>Breaking changes to Document &amp; createNode APIs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/186\">#186</a>)</li>\n<li>When creating a mapping from a JS Object, drop undefined values (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/173\">#173</a>)</li>\n<li>Retain existing nodes when using <code>set()</code> in mappings &amp; sequences (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/185\">#185</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-1\">v2.0.0-1</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve JSON compatibility (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/189\">#189</a>)</li>\n<li>Refactor tag <code>resolve()</code> API (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/201\">#201</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-3\">v2.0.0-3</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop <code>'yaml/parse-cst'</code> endpoint (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/223\">#223</a>)</li>\n<li>Update build configs &amp; minimum supported versions (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/eemeli/yaml/issues/224\">#224</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0-4\">v2.0.0-4</a></h4>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

When this package is installed globally, that file will be linked where global bins go so it is available to run by name.\r\n\r\nwhich is simply not true in case of windows, where it uses the `cmd-shim` module to create cmd files that are usually stored as `C:\\Users\\{Username}\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\xxxx.cmd` and can be executed in the Windows PowerShell as `xxxx.cmd`\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to solve this by appending these information to the doc\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the request in detail.

What it does and why it's being changed. -->\r\nInspired by https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/5519#pullrequestreview-1109795416, went looking for config parameter references in docs that could use a hash in their link, ended up finding unlinked references instead. This PR links them to `/using-npm/config`.\r\n\r\nI tried to be thoughtful about which ones I linked and which I skipped. For example, in `docs/content/using-npm/logging.md`, I didn't link `logs-dir` or `loglevel` because the information in `/using-npm/config` didn't add anything new.\r\n\r\nI _think_ I avoided making any edits inside \"automatically generated\" sections.\r\n\r\nI initially used this search:\r\n``(?<!`workspace)` config[^\\]]``\r\n... including `*.md` files, and excluding `CHANGELOG.md,CHANGELOG-*.md` files.\r\n\r\nI started out excluding `` `workspace` config `` because it occurs often in automatically generated sections.\r\n\r\nI later went back and checked all occurrences of `` `workspace` config ``, I found one that seemed worth linking.\r\n\r\nI searched for:\r\n`^.{81}`\r\n(including `*.md` files, and excluding `CHANGELOG.md,CHANGELOG-*.md` files)\r\n... to make sure I respected what seem to be the norm (lines wrapped at 80 chars).

    "body": "Co-authored-by: Vincent Bailly <vibailly@microsoft.com>\r\n\r\nAdded an `--install-strategy=(hoisted | linked)` config option for `npm install` and `arborist reify`.\r\n\r\nThe new `linked` install mode, dedupes and installs packages in a flat structure in `node_modules/.store`, and then links the directories in `node_modules`. Unlike `hoisted` (the previous and current default behavior), linked installs are not hoisted, and while the `.store` directories are deduped, the tree is not. Links are not hoisted.\r\n\r\nOne added benefit is that dependencies and workspaces will no longer work by coincidence when a shared package is required but the dependency was accidentally omitted from one or more parents.\r\n\r\nThis new install mode may break packages that depend on hoisted behavior. The package-lock.json will not change when switching modes.\r\n\r\nThis is a draft PR with the following known TODOS:\r\n\r\n- [ ] solve resolved URL linking in reify (currently breaking 1 line of coverage)\r\n- [ ] remove dependency on `hash-graph-nodes`\r\n- [ ] properly handle when a workspace is also bundled\r\n- [ ] readability\r\n- [ ] potential for performance improvements\r\n\r\nLonger term (outside the scope of this PR):\r\n- [ ] remove need for emulated tree by converting Node class into proper Proxy and isolating logic",

What it does and why it's being changed. -->\r\nSupport for web based authorization was added for all commands as part of https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/5098. At that time only `publish` supported web based authorization on registry side and to fix unintended output after the URL we disabled progress bar for `publish` as helpfully suggested by @wraithgar in this [Slack thread](https://github.slack.com/archives/C0127EPHNPQ/p1658250931313339?thread_ts=1657721180.117389&cid=C0127EPHNPQ).\r\n\r\nAs part of https://github.com/github/npm/issues/5736 we are updating registry to support web based authorization for all commands which require TFA. To support that change this PR disables progress bar in a central place within `otplease` when registry requires `WebOTP` to avoid the additional unintended output displayed after URL as seen in 👇🏻 screen recordings.\r\n\r\n### Before Fix\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73886592/187214071-737cd1f7-9c1a-4b6e-82d0-8a80299597d8.mov\r\n\r\n### After Fix\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73886592/187214832-ad64bfc2-8417-4848-96bc-537250183ef9.mov\r\n\r\n## References\r\n<!-- Examples:\r\n  Related to #0\r\n  Depends on #0\r\n  Blocked by #0\r\n  Fixes #0\r\n  Closes #0\r\n-->\r\nResolves github/npm#6111\r\n##\r\ncc @jumoel @neeldani @MylesBorins",

    "body": "In v7 the `preinstall` script was intentionally changed to run after dependencies are installed. This was never documented as a breaking change and has since then been neither fixed nor otherwise remedied. While I personally would argue that since it was never listed as a breaking change it should be considered a bug, I recognize that the time elapsed since then complicates matters.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, I propose simply adding a new script that will run before dependencies are installed to restore a critical piece of functionality that was removed without being documented. An oft-cited use for a script being run at that point is to authenticate to a private registry before attempting to fetch packages.\r\n\r\nI also recognize this issue may be more complicated than my initial single commit attempts to make it seem, but the bug report (#2660) seems to have stagnated since it was submitted in February of 2021, and as far as I can tell no one has even attempted a fix. There is [debate](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2660#issuecomment-1081921399) over whether this inaction means that it must be very complicated or not. I hope that this PR will at least spur additional debate. I'm happy to be proven wrong.\r\n\r\nI'm largely unfamiliar with the npm codebase, so please do suggest a different script name (I chose `prefetch` fairly arbitrarily just based on my understanding, but have no attachment to it), different placement for the `runScript` call etc., or additional required changes/tests I may have missed. Or if someone with more understanding of the details is inspired to pick this up and run with it, by all means, please do so.\r\n\r\nEdit: It looks like there was an early attempt (#2713) to move `preinstall` before `reify` that was closed because it would be \"breaking\" (even though, again, this would actually just fix an undocumented change), but no alternative remedy was ever acted on.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nFixes #2660 \r\nRelated to #2713\r\nRelated to https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/403",

    "body": "## What / Why \r\nThis PR resolves the bug which did not allow users to exit the CLI process on hitting CTRL + C for `npm publish --auth-type=web` and `npm login auth-type=web` commands. \r\n\r\n### Approach\r\nWe use `readline` to prompt the user to hit ENTER. However, the first time the user hits CTRL+C, it closes the `readline` instance ([docs](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#event-sigint:~:text=Emit%20SIGINT%20or%20close%20the%20readline%20instance)). The second CTRL+C then kills the CLI process. This PR adds an event listener which listens to `readline`'s SIGINT event  ([docs](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#event-sigint:~:text=supported%20on%20Windows.-,Event%3A%20%27SIGINT%27,-%23)) and then gracefully kills the CLI process from the `cb` function. \r\n\r\nNote: The experience shown after hitting CTRL+C is kept similar to the existing experience when the user hits CTRL+C for login and publish commands without the `auth-type=web` flag\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds a test case to validate the same.\r\n\r\n### Experience\r\n\r\n#### Login\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23032255/182382195-f1236d9a-1047-4f4b-8eaf-50f526b8ca8a.mov\r\n\r\n#### Publish\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23032255/182382242-9ce7d191-3c8c-4840-bbf8-a88f740e41ae.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\nResolves https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/5231\r\n",

My previous idea of using `pathToFileURL` wouldn't work, as relative paths got pre-resolved before converting to URL, i.e. `file:../hello` with CWD of `S:\\\\test\\\\directory` would became `file://S:\\\\test\\\\hello` while some instances of code (NPA) expected not unresolved `file:..\\\\hello`. Aside of that, simply replacing the char would be faster. By the way, I am almost certain that the hash character is the only \"weird\" character that could be used in the paths, as question mark (despite being beginning of query params) hardly can't nor should be used for names (Windows disallows).\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/5120\r\n<!-- Examples:\r\n  Related to #0\r\n  Depends on #0\r\n  Blocked by #0\r\n  Fixes #0\r\n  Closes #0\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Pending work\r\n\r\n- [x] Check other places where `file:` was used and if similar patch could be applied.\r\n",

This PR hides that logging in that case.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR the output looks like:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/645812/175899431-6a034013-f1f1-4746-bde8-2b29a924bb93.png)\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach would be to use the existing auth handler polymorphism, rather than adding branching into `lib/auth/legacy.js`. If we introduce a new `lib/auth/webauthn.js` handler and move our `legacy.js` logic there, then `legacy.js` can log the notice and then call `webauthn.js`. This would avoid the branching introduced by this PR and the unfortunate confusion of `legacy.js` checking if `authType == 'legacy'`. The downside of that approach is the merge conflicts it will create with ongoing work to these files, and the naming confusion around `legacy` and `webauthn`.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- Closes https://github.com/github/npm/issues/5497",

I named\r\nthe option `omitLockfileRegistryResolved` but that can be changed later.\r\n\r\nPut simply, this option causes npm to create lock files without a\r\n`resolved` key for registry dependencies forcing npm to use the current\r\nconfigured registry and resolve package tarball urls on install. This\r\nfixes install errors when users change registries and the recorded\r\nresolved url is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis option causes slower installs because npm must fetch each packages\r\nmanifest to find the tarball url, but it's the most comprehensive\r\nsolution to this problem. Options like recording always the default\r\nregistry, or recording a special 'current registry' sigil will break if\r\nregistries host tarballs at different paths. For example\r\n`${REGISTRY}/npm/-/npm-8.3.0.tgz` only works if all registries host\r\ntarballs at `npm/-/npm-8.3.0.tgz`.",

This can cause undesired behaviors including install failures when changing the configured registry.\r\n\r\nThis is very much a work in progress and I'm eager for any feedback, especially  the names of the options, alternate solutions to these problems, and how I've plumbed 'options' thru the Shrinkwrap class.\r\n\r\n### `omit-lockfile-registry-resolved`\r\n\r\nThis option omits the resolved value from the registry. On subsequent installs npm will resolve the tarball url from the registry. This supports any kind of registry, and guarantees the registry is the authority on the location of tarballs, but makes installs slower.\r\n\r\n### `record-default-registry`\r\nThis option uses the magic properties of the default registry `https://registry.npmjs.com`. When the lockfile is read npm replaces the default registry with the currently configured registry. This magic behavior allows users to switch from the default registry to a custom registry - but you can't switch from a custom registry to another registry once a custom registry is recorded in a lock file.\r\n\r\nThis option does the opposite transform of the magic default, replacing the custom registry with the default registry when recording the lock file.\r\n\r\nThere were other proposals to record lock files with a sigil that explicitly means 'the current registry'\r\n\r\n> \"resolved\": \"${registry}/npm/-/npm-8.3.1.tgz\"\r\n\r\nBut this isn't cross compatible with other npm versions or clients. This option effectively uses `https://registry.npmjs.com` as that sigil, which is compatible with earlier versions of npm.\r\n\r\nThe main downside with this option is that the lockfile records the path portion of the resolved url which can change between registries. This option only supports switching between registries that host tarballs at the same relative path. This downside is already present in npm's magic handling of the default registry.\r\n\r\nThe other downside is that it hangs more weight on the magic behavior of the default registry.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nRelated to npm/rfcs#486\r\n",

    "body": "## THIS PR HAS BEEN MIGRATED\r\nOriginally at npm/arborist#363\r\nOriginally by @salvadorj\r\n\r\nWhen installing a package with bundled dependencies with npm it can end up missing some dependencies that were bundled and attempt to fetch from the remote registry (see https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2757). This issue only happens on Windows and it's caused by `_findMissingEdges` missing one of the bundled dependencies. The reason it only happens on Windows is because of this lookup in `this[_cache]` with a path that contains mixed path separators:\r\nhttps://github.com/npm/arborist/blob/02f295f2d0caa6de2d3235c6eb1c180a8afa0f6f/lib/arborist/load-actual.js#L433-L435\r\n\r\nOn macOS we get a result back and avoid creating a new node. On Windows we get no result since the key in the cache is using backslashes but the lookup key has both backslashes and forward slashes. This results in a new node being created with the path of an existing node which in turn removes the existing node and its children from the tree. The children are however not loaded from the file system again because of this check:\r\nhttps://github.com/npm/arborist/blob/02f295f2d0caa6de2d3235c6eb1c180a8afa0f6f/lib/arborist/load-actual.js#L353-L357\r\n\r\nThe end result is an unmet dependency and npm attempting to fetch it from the registry instead of using the bundled dependency.\r\n\r\nI've changed the cache key by normalizing the path to avoid replacing existing nodes. I've setup a minimal test case where the difference in behavior (with and without normalization) shows up as an error on the outgoing edge of a node.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nFixes https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2757\r\n",

What it does and why it's being changed. -->\r\n\r\n# TLDR\r\nThis PR changes the default behaviour of NPM to **not** save package versions with the `^` prefix.\r\nInstead, packages would be saved with no prefix.\r\n\r\nAs a TL;DR, the implications of this is that **all dependencies will be pinned to the version you installed by default**. \r\n\r\n# Changing This Yourself\r\nIf you're reading this PR and want to apply it to your own environments, invoke `npm config set save-prefix=''`.\r\n\r\n# Existing Behaviour\r\nThe `^1.0.0` range means that NPM will accept any package that is `1.0.0` or greater in the *MINOR* or *PATCH* field. This means `1.0.2` and `1.2.0` are legal matches, but `2.0.0` is not.\r\n\r\nSince packages on NPM are expected to follow semver, this has the presumed intention of automatically opting users into security patches. For details I'll go into in a minute, there are no actual security benefits to this design decision.\r\n\r\nNPMs design has changed a lot since its original iteration, and I feel it is important to note that this decision was made back in npmv1 (or older). This means **this design decision predates package-lock.json, --save being the default, and more**.\r\n\r\n# Why change it?\r\nThere are massive security implications for this default. Semver is not enforceable, and what constitutes a `PATCH`/`MINOR` to one person might be a breaking change to another.\r\n\r\nAs an example, `mongodb`'s `3.6.4` update caused `monk` to [endlessly spit out warnings](https://github.com/Automattic/monk/issues/333). \r\n\r\nThis can have pretty serious implications for people using NPM in production. Blindly running `npm install` on a different machine can result in different dependencies being installed to your local dev version! Sure, you installed `3.6.3`, but `^3.6.3` means that npm is perfectly within its right to get `3.6.4`. (n.b. `npm ci` should be used to avoid this behaviour, but why is the default dangerous?)\r\n\r\nAlthough `package-lock.json` exists to solve this, `package-lock.json` is regenerated whenever an option touches `package.json` or `node_modules`. This means that `npm install`ing another module will result in all of your `^x.x.x` packages being bumped aswell.\r\n\r\n# Security Implications\r\nIf a library is compromised somehow, the author can publish a PATCH/MINOR version that performs malicious actions. Given that semver is not enforceable (NPM cannot possibly say -- hey, this change is too major for a patch release), this means that the compromised library can essentially do whatever it wants to almost every single one of its dependents.\r\n\r\nSince this happens automatically as the result of doing other things (i.e. anything that interacts with `package.json`), this means even installing a new, entirely separate package can result in the compromised library getting exec access.\r\n\r\n# Scope for attack\r\nNPM is based around micropackages. For any given package, there are likely to be hundreds or even thousands of tiny packages holding it up. Every single one of those libraries is a target for attackers, as compromising any of the ones that make up a larger package can result in full code execution on *millions* of machines or applications.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, NPM does not enforce 2FA on accounts of package authors. If a package authors password is leaked online, they could have their account hijacked. Although this would be bad on its own, the fact that they can then upload malware that *near-automatically propogates* across the entire ecosystem moves the scope from *bad* to *incredibly bad*.\r\n\r\nWhile changing the default from `^` to nothing does not fix all of these issues, it would stunt the spread of malicious patch updates, as it would only affect users newly directly installing the package, rather than installing any package that depends on it. This moves the difficulty up (in theory) from compromising any micropackage to compromising a larger package (say, `react`) in order to get such an impact.\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\nWhile `colors.js` is the example everyone is currently thinking about, this is not even close to the only time this has happened.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of just some packages in recent memory that have leveraged this default behaviour to perform large scale attacks.\r\n\r\n- [UAParser (October 22 2021)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js)\r\n- [coa (November 4 2021)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-73qr-pfmq-6rp8)\r\n- [rc (November 4 2021)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g2q5-5433-rhrf)\r\n- [another-date-range-picker (September 1 2020)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8rxg-9g6f-vq9p)\r\n- [another-date-picker (September 1 2020)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8rxg-9g6f-vq9p)\r\n- [stream-combine (September 2 2020)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w6xj-45gv-fw35)\r\n- [angular-bmap (September 1 2020)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w8hg-mxvh-9h57)\r\n\r\n# Arguing against 'automatic patching'\r\nA potential retort to this would be that the current behaviour causes users to get potential security patches automatically. However, this is not really the case.\r\n\r\nConsider the case where a user has a bunch of packages, and `foobar@1.0.1` has a security vulnerability.\r\nThe user's package json has `\"foobar\": \"^1.0.0\"`.\r\nA new version of `foobar` is released to deal with this security vulnerabilty.\r\n\r\nThe user is **not** safe in any way against their vulnerability until they do anything that interacts with their `package.json`. When they do, it is possible that `npm` will update the package to the latest patch version available, but it is not **required** to do so. If they have another dependency that perhaps isn't as lenient with its version of `foobar`, `npm` will not automatically apply the security patch.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this automatic application of the latest version **does not** update `package.json`. It would be perfectly legal for NPM to install `1.0.1` again, there's absolutely no guarantee that that would happen.\r\n\r\nThe amount of edge cases and scenarios involved with hoping `npm` pulls the right version out of a set of versions that *do contain significant security vulnerabilities* is *not* worth it. You should explicitly state that you want the security patch and *explicitly* have it in your `package.json` that you do not ever want version `v1.0.1`.\r\n\r\nA tool like `npm audit` is already invoked on almost every operation. [Even if it is critically flawed](https://overreacted.io/npm-audit-broken-by-design/), it is still a useful way of alerting users to security issues that affect them, and encourage them to update their version of a package.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\nIn my opinion, the default behaviour should **always** be pinning dependencies to the exact version. Updating packages should be opt-in, not opt-out.\r\n\r\n",

      "fix: npm update --save (#4223)\n\nPreviously `npm update` was not respecting the `save` option, it\r\nwould be impossible for users to use `npm update` and automatically\r\nupdate their `package.json` files.\r\n\r\nThis fixes it by adding extra steps on `Arborist.reify._saveIdealTree`\r\nto read direct dependencies of any `package.json` and update them as\r\nneeded when reifying using the `update` and `save` options.\r\n\r\n- Uses config.isDefault to set a different value for the `save` config\r\n  for both the update and dedupe commands\r\n- Tweaks arborist to make sure saveIdealTree preserves the behavior of\r\n  skipping writing to package-lock.json on save=false for install while\r\n  still writing the lockfile for `npm update` with its new default value\r\n  of save=false.\r\n- Updated and added some new tests on arborist to cover for these tweaks\r\n- Added `npm update --save` smoke test on cli\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/708\r\nFixes: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2704\r\nRelates to: https://github.com/npm/feedback/discussions/270"

The gist is there's a requirement to create a production copy of a package or workspace for deployment (zip archives for lambda, `COPY` into docker image) and existing npm commands have shortcomings, specifically regarding workspaces.\r\n\r\nThis draft CR will give a foundation for discussions.\r\n - what scripts, if any should be run when a workspace package is copied?\r\n - should this command respect `--omit` and `--production` flags?\r\n - could `pack`, `install` or another command support this usecase instead of adding a new command?\r\n - what should this command or flag be called?\r\n\r\nI'll work on tests and documentation after more of the command is finalized\r\n\r\nGoals (still up for discussion):\r\n - support workspace and non workspace packages\r\n - in a workspace a subset of workspace packages can be copied\r\n - command should not install new packages from the registry, instead it should manipulate the existing node_modules directory\r\n  - command should copy install script generated files (should not need to run install scripts for packages copied from node_modules)\r\n",

For example if you're on a Windows or Linux machine, `npm audit` can report `fsevents > ini` as being vulnerable but `npm list ini` wouldn't show the dependency since it's not in the physical tree. `npm list ini --package-lock-only` on the other hand will.\r\n\r\nThis also means that these tools don't need to be able to do a valid `npm install` (which can be costly), since the virtual tree doesn't require `node_modules` to exist.\r\n\r\nI've implemented some basic tests based on the existing ones, but have not done so for all possible permutations of flags as I felt that could be overkill and I don't have a deep enough knowledge on `package-lock.json` to confidently create all the `package-lock.json` equivalents of the `node_modules` required for each test.\r\n\r\nI also couldn't figure out where to update the documentation, as there's tags saying not to edit manually but I couldn't find where they were actually generated from.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n<!-- Examples:\r\n  Related to #0\r\n  Depends on #0\r\n  Blocked by #0\r\n  Fixes #0\r\n  Closes #0\r\n-->\r\n\r\nResolves #3068\r\nSuperseeds #3404",

This would match the tree I'm guessing `npm audit` checks against, as currently for one of our projects `npm audit` flags `node_modules/fsevents/node_modules/ini`, but doing `npm list ini` does not show any version of `ini` within the vulnerable range; with this change it does show up.\r\n\r\n*However*, this could be the complete opposite of what `npm list` is meant to do, so some discussion might be needed 😓 \r\n\r\n## References\r\n<!-- Examples:\r\n  Related to #0\r\n  Depends on #0\r\n  Blocked by #0\r\n  Fixes #0\r\n  Closes #0\r\n-->\r\n\r\nResolves #3068",

To ensure that\nthis is the default behavior if no locale is specified, `LC_ALL=sk` is\nset in the test environment.\n\nOther instances of `localeCompare` sort data that the cli controls, so\nno tests were added.\n\nRe: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2829\n\nPR-URL: https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/3203\nCredit: @isaacs\nClose: #3203\nReviewed-by: @ruyadorno"

    "body": "There are a few commands (exec, run-script, and the run-script proxies)\r\nwhere essentially npm is acting like a very fancy shell.  It is peculiar\r\nand noisy for npm to print a verbose error banner at the end of these\r\ncommands, since presumably the command itself already did whatever it\r\nhad to do to report the error appropriately.\r\n\r\nFor example, `npm test` runs a test script, usually outputting test\r\nresults.  Having npm then tell me that my tests failed with exit status\r\n1 and print a debug log, is unnecessary and unwanted.\r\n\r\nWhen the error encountered for these commands does not have a non-zero\r\nnumeric 'code', then we still print the standard npm error reporting\r\nmessages, because presumably something went wrong OTHER than a process\r\nexiting with a non-zero status code.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this should be considered a breaking change or a bugfix or a feature.  It is a change to our output, so anyone relying on that for test failures will be broken.  However, it also removes a lot of clutter that is providing no value in the vast majority of uses of `npm test`, and allows you to use `npm exec` with commands that may communicate something interesting both in stderr and the exit status code.  For example, a shell script that outputs JSON to stderr would not be usable with `npm exec` right now because of this extra debugging output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What / Why -->\r\n<!-- Describe the request in detail.

A wildcard `*` is passed as the version range when deprecating an entire package, but wildcards [don't include prereleases by the semver library's rules](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#prerelease-tags), so we need to pass the `includePrerelease: true` option so that all prereleases are included in the deprecated versions.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nFixes https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/1615\r\n",

What it does and why it's being changed. -->\r\n\r\nThis commit enables the behaviour that globally installed packages should run the scripts in their package.json file.\r\n\r\nI think this should be a certainly serious bug in npm 7.x. Since v7, globally installed packages won't run scripts any more, unlike what npm v6 does. This causes lots of failures in my development.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's a reason for this breaking change but I couldn't see any information mentioned in either changelogs or blogs. Also, I don't know why there's nobody having asked yet....(Perhaps the [quieter install scripts](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/implemented/0022-quieter-install-scripts.md) makes it less obvious? Someone mentioned it #2194, but later he said it's running actually, which confused me. I think he's not sure either...?)\r\n\r\n<!-- Examples:\r\n## References\r\n  Related to #0\r\n  Depends on #0\r\n  Blocked by #0\r\n  Fixes #0\r\n  Closes #0\r\n-->\r\n",

Automating the  link-\r\n       ing  process as part of npm install and avoiding manually having to use\r\n       npm link in order to add references to packages  that  should  be  sym-\r\n       linked into the current node_modules folder.\r\n\r\n       We also refer to these packages being auto-symlinked during npm install\r\n       as a single workspace, meaning it's a nested package within the current\r\n       local  file  system  that  is  explicitly defined in the npm help pack-\r\n       age.json workspaces configuration.\r\n\r\n   Installing workspaces\r\n       Workspaces are usually defined via the workspaces property of  the  npm\r\n       help package.json file, e.g:\r\n\r\n         {\r\n           \"name\": \"my-workspaces-powered-project\",\r\n           \"workspaces\": [\r\n             \"workspace-a\"\r\n           ]\r\n         }\r\n\r\n       Given the above package.json example living at a current working direc-\r\n       tory . that contains a folder named  workspace-a  that  disposes  of  a\r\n       package.json inside it, defining a nodejs package, e.g:\r\n\r\n         .\r\n         +-- package.json\r\n         `-- workspace-a\r\n            `-- package.json\r\n\r\n       The  expected  result  once running npm install in this current working\r\n       directory . is that the folder workspace-a will get  symlinked  to  the\r\n       node_modules folder of the current working dir.\r\n\r\n       Below  is  a post npm install example, given that same previous example\r\n       structure of files and folders:\r\n\r\n         .\r\n         +-- node_modules\r\n         |  `-- workspace-a -> ../workspace-a\r\n         +-- package-lock.json\r\n         +-- package.json\r\n         `-- workspace-a\r\n            `-- package.json\r\n\r\n   Using workspaces\r\n       Given  the  specifities  of  how  Node.js  handles  module   resolution\r\n       https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html#mod-\r\n       ules_all_together it's possible to consume  any  defined  workspace  by\r\n       it's  declared  package.json  name. Continuing from the example defined\r\n       above, let's also  create  a  Node.js  script  that  will  require  the\r\n       workspace-a example module, e.g:\r\n\r\n         // ./workspace-a/index.js\r\n         module.exports = 'a'\r\n\r\n         // ./lib/index.js\r\n         const moduleA = require('workspace-a')\r\n         console.log(moduleA) // -> a\r\n\r\n       When running it with:\r\n\r\n       node lib/index.js\r\n\r\n       This  demonstrates how the nature of node_modules resolution allows for\r\n       workspaces to enable a portable workflow for requiring  each  workspace\r\n       in  such  a  way  that  is  also  easy to npm help publish these nested\r\n       workspaces to be consumed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n   See also\r\n       o npm help install\r\n\r\n       o npm help publish\r\n\r\n                                 October 2020                         SCOPE(7)\r\n(END)\r\n```",

For example, it would make it easier to identify an npm process inside `top`, `htop`, `ps`. We would simply like to give npm the ability to set the title. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the request in detail. What it does and why it's being changed. -->\r\n\r\nThis just adds simple code to report the npm command being run in the process title. \r\n\r\nI am expecting this to be closed because I suspect that the reason why the shell command that is being run is not shown in the title is done for security reasons (in case an npm command is constructed with passwords right in the command). \r\n\r\nI think that even if this is grounds for rejection, we could at least have a discussion about whether we could add a flag to the CLI to allow the title to be manually specified or maybe a flag that can be configured to let it run this code?\r\n\r\nBasically this will allow npm cli to report itself as `npm start` or `npm run lint` etc.  rather than just always `npm`.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",

The group I was in decided to look at the evolution of DevOps into DevSecOps.  This PR adds some security related steps into the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe PR adds a new GitHub action called Security Checks that:\r\n1. Runs on `ubuntu-latest`\r\n2. Runs against Node 10, 12, and 14\r\n3. Runs a `npm install`\r\n4. Runs `npm audit` against production packages with the audit level set at moderate\r\n5. Runs another `npm audit` against the entire package with the audit level set at critical\r\n6. Runs a static analysis tool `twly` to look for duplicated code.\r\n\r\nThis pipeline is setup this way to avoid any known security issue above moderate from being used within the production builds of npm and to give more visibility of security issues within dev-dependencies. \r\n\r\ntwly itself is not necessarily a security tool but the idea of having it included is to help keep the npm code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).  This will help security overall by ensuring that any bug/security issue found in the code will only need to be fixed in less spots (hopefully just one).  This tool is configurable through the `.trc` file and is currently setup to fail at anything below a threshold of 95.  As configured it will only look the `src` folder and report duplicates if a minimum of 5 lines and 50 characters are found duplicated.\r\n\r\nAlso in this PR is a dependabot config file.  This is in here to help maintain up-to-date dependencies, it is configured to run once a week. \r\n\r\nThis PR was the work of: \r\n* Me (@jskoll)\r\n* Tony (@atomaro)\r\n* Jason (@jpschafer)\r\n* Mike (@michaelhm)\r\n",

This PR also introduced the `--also` option which can install both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. I have checked that `npm install --dev` installs both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` (see https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/lib/install.js#L233), so I think that the correct message should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm WARN install Usage of the `--dev` option is deprecated.

When I develop locally, I prefer to install to the global folder and then just link to that. However, when I push to CI/CD systems, it's easier for those systems to simply \"npm install\" and just consume whatever deps are listed in the package.json. Other times, I have a scaffolded project, where it will consistently use the same deps; for example a Vue project with linters and test framework. It's super easy for me to re-use those package.json files and run `npm install --link` to install link to the deps in the new project.\r\n\r\nWhat this change does is it respects the save options so that after install linking, the package.json gets updated. I think it's become a convention to save deps by default, so, in order to not save, the \"--no-save\" options must be used. \r\n\r\nWhat's missing from this pull request: updated tests. Since that could be somewhat of a lift for me, I wanted to first get feedback on the suggested change before proceeding with that.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n<!-- Examples\r\n  * Related to #0\r\n  * Depends on #0\r\n  * Blocked by #0\r\n  * Closes #0\r\n-->\r\n* n/a\r\n",

The main things going on here:\r\n\r\n- All of the commands that perform an `arborist.reify()` have been ported to actually use Arborist (except for `prune` and `dedupe` that are blocked by Arborist lacking those features for the moment.)  That is: install, ci, rm, update, audit, audit fix.\r\n- A `util/reify-output.js` module is added, which all of these call to produce consistent output after operation.\r\n- `npm audit` is _almost_ where it needs to be, but Arborist.audit() and npm-audit-report need to be made aware that bundled deps can't be fixed with `npm audit fix`.\r\n- Interesting change: if there's still an audit issue after running `npm audit fix`, it'll print a _full_ audit, so you don't have the annoying behavior of running `npm audit fix` and having it tell you to run `npm audit fix` again.  (Also: it'll only suggest running `npm audit fix` if there's actually something that can be fixed, and `npm audit fix` can fix transitive meta-dependency issues no matter how deep!)\r\n- `npm shrinkwrap` is updated to use Arborist, so that it will always update the shrinkwrap to the latest and greatest lockfileVersion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we _still_ can't fully remove the `lib/install/` folder, because it's being used by ls, fund, and `util/error-message.js`.  But almost!\r\n\r\nNext up for pieces keeping lib/install/*.js and lib/fetch-package-metadata.js around:\r\n\r\n- implement `prune` in Arborist\r\n- implement `dedupe` in Arborist\r\n- get https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/1208 landed\r\n- implement `rebuild` in Arborist (or, if not a top-level arborist method, implement it using Arborist.loadActual() and bin-links instead; but it really feels like it might be more under Arborist's charter than the cli's.)\r\n- port ls to use Arborist.loadActual()\r\n- port fund to use Arborist.loadActual()\r\n- remove lib/build.js\r\n- remove lib/unbuild.js\r\n- remove or refactor the diff detection in utils/error-message.js so it doens't rely on install/read-shrinkwrap.js",

It removes the `--depth` option flag and introduces a new `--all` one for displaying all outdated dependencies in a tree. The homepage information of a package is now taken directly from the packument instead of the `package.json` to avoid displaying outdated information. The location info is now the `node.location` (it's position on the physical tree) instead of it's position on the logical dependency tree. \r\n\r\nA new column `Depended by` was also added on the default display that shows which package depends on the displayed dependency. This makes the information displayed when `--all` is on easier to understand.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nhttp://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/133\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n```\r\n➜  arborist git:(master) npm outdated\r\nPackage                   Current   Wanted   Latest  Location                               Depended by\r\n@npmcli/run-script          1.2.1    1.3.1    1.3.1  node_modules/@npmcli/run-script        arborist\r\nminify-registry-metadata    2.1.0    2.2.0    2.2.0  node_modules/minify-registry-metadata  arborist\r\nnpm-package-arg             8.0.0    8.0.1    8.0.1  node_modules/npm-package-arg           arborist\r\npacote                     11.1.0   11.1.7   11.1.7  node_modules/pacote                    arborist\r\nsemver                      7.1.2    7.3.2    7.3.2  node_modules/semver                    arborist\r\ntap                       14.10.6  14.10.7  14.10.7  node_modules/tap                       arborist\r\ntcompare                    3.0.4    3.0.4    5.0.2  node_modules/tcompare                  arborist\r\ntreeverse                   1.0.2    1.0.3    1.0.3  node_modules/treeverse                 arborist\r\n➜  arborist git:(master) npm outdated tar\r\nPackage  Current  Wanted  Latest  Location                                Depended by\r\ntar        6.0.1   6.0.2   6.0.2  node_modules/tar                        cacache\r\ntar        6.0.1   6.0.2   6.0.2  node_modules/tar                        pacote\r\ntar       4.4.13   6.0.2   6.0.2  node_modules/node-gyp/node_modules/tar  node-gyp\r\n```",

Since scripts/install.js is running for two different phases, it would be wise in this case to look at the npm_lifecycle_event environment variable.\r\n\r\nI think the postinstall script command should be \"scripts/install.js\", and the [official website documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/using-npm/scripts.html#examples) also verified my idea.\r\n\r\nBy the way also beautify the code style of the JSON example :P \r\n",

But when reading from shrinkwap file, the shrinkwrap file stores paths relative to the top package's path.\r\n\r\nBoth data are used to populate a `tree.package.dependencies` field. For the shrinkwrap, it happens [here](https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/f533d61eb27c484fae84571fbea8bc1d83acb42b/lib/install/inflate-shrinkwrap.js#L160). But such `dependencies` have wrong path. They need to be relativized after reading from the shrinkwrap.\r\n\r\nThe bug manifests when `computeMetadata` goes through `tree.package.dependencies` and tries to find a matching package in the tree that satisfies each dependency. But because the `file:` paths are wrong, the matching package is not found, although it is present in the tree. The package's `requiredBy` array remains empty and it's removed by `pruneIdealTree`. The result is a broken `node_modules` tree with missing links.",

Would you be able to revert this change?\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is that this could cause performance and compatibility issues for npm. Users in WSL would be expecting to use the Linux version of npm, and instead routing the command to target the Windows version of npm could cause unexpected problems. \r\n\r\nI'm happy to dive into more detail on the reasons why, and thank you for thinking about WSL when you made this change! :)\r\n",

I've done my best to convert the `.travis.yml` file over to a GitHub Actions' `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.\r\n\r\nFor the most part I was able to directly map everything that was being done in Travis except the Slack notification. If that's a blocker, we could perhaps create a separate Actions => Slack action that works with the id like Travis.\r\n\r\nAs for why - I saw that a Travis build was pending for around 40 minutes. That's my whole reasoning 😁 ~You can take a look at the timings here in this PR~ Actions won't show the statuses on this PR because they ran on my fork - you can 👀 them here: https://github.com/JasonEtco/cli/actions.\r\n\r\nThis workflow runs the full test suite against Node 8,10 and 12, and against Linux (`ubuntu-latest`) and Windows.\r\n\r\nThe Travis and Appveyor files can be removed, but I figured y'all can try this out before removing the others if you decide you want to.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can clarify anything 👍 ",

    "body": "This diff implements the `peerDependenciesMeta` field specified in the [following rfc](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/blob/master/accepted/0000-optional-peer-dependencies.md).\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nThis field provides a way to package authors to disable the peer dependency warnings for packages that may be needed for some integrations, but only affect a subset of the users and aren't worth printing a warning to all.\r\n\r\n## Why implement it this way?\r\n\r\nThe rfc can be read for more details on why this syntax and not another; it's worth noting that both Yarn and pnpm (cc @zkochan) have been supporting this field for about half a year now.\r\n\r\n## Why is it important?\r\n\r\nWith npm still being roughly half the Javascript ecosystem, some maintainers are found omitting to declare their peer dependencies altogether just to avoid the peer dependency warning to their users. It generates invalid dependency trees that may work in the best cases, but break when an unrelated package is added to the dependency tree and changes the way the hoisting works.\r\n\r\n## Why is it broken not to list peer dependencies?\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>It's convoluted, click to expand 🙂</summary>\r\n\r\nProof by example; imagine the following setup:\r\n\r\n- `A` depends on `B@*`, and has an **unlisted** peer dependency on `X`\r\n- your app depends on `A` and `X@1`\r\n- `B@1` depends on nothing\r\n\r\nIn this situation, we get the following tree:\r\n\r\n```\r\n. - A - B@1\r\n  \\\r\n    X@1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe package `A` is able to access `X@1` (assuming a `node_modules` install), everything is ok. Now let's say that `B` gets a new release, `B@2`, which includes a dependency on `X@2`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n. - A - B@2 - X@2\r\n  \\\r\n    X@1\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut because of the hoisting, and because there is no conflict doing this, `X` will be moved from `B` to its parent folder. We'll now get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n. - A - B@2\r\n  \\   \\ \r\n    X   X@2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this hoisting, when `A` makes a require call to obtain `X`, it will no longer get the `X@1` provided by its parent. Instead it will get `X@2` provided by its child, breaking the original contract in a very subtle way.\r\n\r\nIf `X` had been listed as peer dependency of `A`, even optional, then the package manager would have been able to detect that hoisting `X` into `A` would have caused a conflict, and this problem would have been avoided.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Where are the tests?\r\n\r\nThis diff was manually tested by patching my local npm and trying it out. I also don't see how it could have any adverse effect, although I'm not familiar with the codebase.\r\n\r\nRegarding automated tests, given that the fixtures are stored in a separate repository I figured you might want to integrate them yourself - although I can do it if you prefer. From a cursory glance, the relevant files to modify are:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/test/tap/peer-deps.js\r\n  This is a trap, this file should not be modified 😃 It's just the test that matters.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-mock/blob/master/fixtures/npm-test-peer-deps.json\r\n  An optional unmet peer dependency should be added.",

When this file is big (e.g. including a custom cert + all system certs) it causes a kernel exception on Linux (E2BIG: Argument list too long).\r\n\r\nThe current implementation requires `prepublish` to be fully deprecated because I couldn't figure out a way to only set the `ignore-prepublish` config setting for the git install. Setting it with `npm.config.set('ignore-prepublish', true)` before the install doesn't seem to be picked up in the `npm-lifecycle` package when running the `prepublish` stage.\r\n\r\nI imagine it will be a pain to deprecated `prepublish` without breaking a bunch of packages, is this still something you're planning or should I find a workaround?",

    "body": "This small PR begins what will likely be a larger conversation on making `package.json` a more effective communication channel from developers to users about project sustainability needs.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nStandardize a `package.json` property for sustainability data that points to a JSON endpoint developers can update out-of-band.\r\n\r\nAllow developers to put sustainability data, on a [simple schema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sustainability-schema), on `master` in their publicly hosted Git repos.  Then to set `sustainability` in `package.json` to the URL where the Git host will serve the JSON file.  For many npm devs, that will be some endpoint on raw.githubusercontent.com.\r\n\r\nPer the schema, the JSON data may include references to other endpoints for specific contributors.  That way, individual developers, businesses, and nonprofits can define `sustainability.json` files or similar on their own domains, and edit sustainability metadata for specific projects only to include reference to permalinks for sustainability endpoints specific to them.\r\n\r\n## Operating Environment\r\n\r\nThe approach I propose here reflects two key observations:\r\n\r\n1. `package.json` is a package's passport across developer, user, and contributor lines. If developers need to send messages to users, `package.json` is their best bet.\r\n\r\n    In that sense, messages developers send via `package.json` are reliable.  In most situations, they will be received if the code is.\r\n\r\n2. At the same time, there is _no_ guarantee that users will have or receive the latest versions of packages or their `package.json` files at any given time.  Folks download old versions of packages all the time. As a result, `package.json` files can be worse for real-time communication than postal mail.  When the messages developers want to send have to be current, relying on `package.json` will only teach users not to rely on what they see there.\r\n\r\n    In that sense, messages developers send via `package.json` are high latency.  They will be received, but God only knows how soon.\r\n\r\nSustainability information, such as the availability of individuals for hire, of paid products and services to buy, and even of lists of who has contributed or currently drives a project, all needs to be current to feel reliable, and therefore to be actionable, and therefore to be effective.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a solution that plays to `package.json`'s messaging strengths by using it to send permalinks that can in turn provide more time-sensitive data to those interested.\r\n\r\n## Prior Art\r\n\r\nToo much to list here.  But foremost in my mind have been:\r\n\r\n- @feross' [`thanks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thanks), a CLI app that recurses `node_modules`, compares results to [packaged maps from author, organization, and package to URIs](https://github.com/feross/thanks/blob/d1c5896dc48e83cc99cd9c92437cbfaf7500ec8d/index.js).  The approach I propose here evolves that of `thanks` by decentralizing publication of actionable sustainability data.  @feross shouldn't have to merge a PR for every dev and project asking for donations, and every dev changing their approach or service provider.\r\n\r\n- My own [License Zero](https://licensezero.com), which uses non-standard `package.json` properties to encode signed metadata about the availability of licenses for use in closed software development.\r\n\r\n- OpenCollective's `collective` property, which functions similarly, as a pointer and trigger for HTTP requests for up-to-date data.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are myriad opinions about how to address open source \"sustainability\".  I hold no less than a few myself, including a profound regret that \"sustainability\" has won out as the going term for this issue.\r\n\r\nNo matter which approach folks prefer, the common thread is lack of rich information about who is behind what software, and what users can do for them.  What we see now is a Cambrian Explosion of attempts to tunnel sustainability information through various existing communication channels---documentation, licensing, and so on.  I don't think we're anywhere close to being able to call the winner.  And I don't think npm should put its thumb on the scales, in favor of any particular \"sustainability as a service\" vendor or approach.\r\n\r\nBut I seen an opportunity to give structure to that diversity, so users can consume it en masse.  And I see an opportunity for npm to facilitate in a self-consciously neutral way.  Every sustained effort I've seen to facilitate support for open software developers has URLs with calls to action.  Turning `package.json` into a way to systematically inventory and follow up on those calls is what this PR is about.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nFolks working at npm, Inc. have never been shy telling the world that I represent npm, Inc. as legal counsel. Contributions to npm CLI probably had more than a little to do with my receiving that professional opportunity. But then, as now, this proposal to npm CLI is well outside my legal responsibilities to the company.  npm does not pay me to code, and the CLI team did not ask for this PR.\r\n\r\nPer the [contributing guide](https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/CONTRIBUTING.md), I fully embrace that I bring this PR as a \"community member\", and not an \"npm, Inc. employee\".  I'll do my best to confine back-and-forth on this proposal to public fora, like PR comments.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't send this if I didn't think it worth landing as proposed.  But I know better than to think I might have got it right, out of the gate, by anything but blind luck.  Very much looking forward to thoughts and views of others.",

The current behavior of a package published with a shrinkwrap file that includes devDeps is that the devDeps get installed when the package is installed globally (not what you would typically want ever).  The only way around this was to `prune --prod` during prepack to generate a shrinkwrap without devDeps and publish with that (prior to this change going out).  See people here discussing that workaround: ([here](https://npm.community/t/devdependencies-installed-when-package-has-shrinkwrap-file/2244) [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47739968/1287889))\r\n\r\nAfter this change, `prune --prod` no longer modifies the shrinkwrap file to remove devDeps.   Reverting this commit restores the old behavior. \r\n\r\nThe situation is already looking like a hack but here are two alternative ideas: \r\n\r\n- Perhaps the commit in question IS correct, but a shrinkwrapped package should not install devDeps when installed as a dependency or global package (this seems the most correct and implied behavior described in https://docs.npmjs.com/files/shrinkwrap.json).  This is not the current behavior now though.\r\n- Perhaps running `npm shrinkwrap --prod` should remove the devDeps from the lock file (without pruning node_modules so its faster and can be restored by shrink-wrapping without the flag).  The goal isn't to prune node_modules, its to get my shrinkwrap file right. \r\n\r\nI would propose we revert this change in the meantime so that this avenue isn’t broken, until the primary issue is resolved.\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit cec5be5427f7f5106a905de8630e1243e9b36ef4.\r\n\r\n\r\n### workaround for those interested\r\n\r\n- During prepack: `npm prune --prod && rm npm-shrinkwrap.json && npm shrinkwrap` Generates the shrinkwrap without devDeps\r\n- During postpack: `git checkout -- npm-shrinkwrap.json && npm i` restores devDeps and reinstalls what was removed during the prune.",

But do read on, please.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nHere's the verbose log from running `npm audit` against my repo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0 info it worked if it ends with ok\r\n1 verbose cli [ 'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\node.exe',\r\n1 verbose cli   'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\node_modules\\\\npm\\\\bin\\\\npm-cli.js',\r\n1 verbose cli   'audit',\r\n1 verbose cli   '--registry',\r\n1 verbose cli   'http://localhost:1234/npm' ]\r\n2 info using npm@6.2.0\r\n3 info using node@v10.9.0\r\n4 verbose npm-session 044f543ee484e70f\r\n5 timing audit compress Completed in 3ms\r\n6 info audit Submitting payload of 264 bytes\r\n7 http fetch POST 400 http://localhost:1234/npm/-/npm/v1/security/audits 78ms\r\n8 verbose stack Error: 400 Bad Request - POST http://localhost:1234/npm/-/npm/v1/security/audits\r\n8 verbose stack     at res.buffer.catch.then.body (C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node_modules\\npm\\node_modules\\npm-registry-fetch\\check-response.js:94:15)\r\n8 verbose stack     at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:68:7)\r\n9 verbose statusCode 400\r\n10 verbose cwd C:\\Users\\maart\\Desktop\\foo\r\n11 verbose Windows_NT 10.0.17134\r\n12 verbose argv \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\node.exe\" \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\node_modules\\\\npm\\\\bin\\\\npm-cli.js\" \"audit\" \"--registry\" \"http://localhost:1234/npm\"\r\n13 verbose node v10.9.0\r\n14 verbose npm  v6.2.0\r\n15 error code E400\r\n16 error 400 Bad Request - POST http://localhost:1234/npm/-/npm/v1/security/audits\r\n17 verbose exit [ 1, true ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving some HTTP inspector in between, this is the request that was made:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST http://localhost:1234/npm/-/npm/v1/security/audits\r\nconnection: keep-alive\r\nuser-agent: npm/6.2.0 node/v10.9.0 win32 x64\r\nnpm-in-ci: false\r\nnpm-scope: \r\nnpm-session: db3e53c56f1e3571\r\nreferer: undefined\r\ncontent-encoding: gzip\r\ncontent-type: application/json\r\ncontent-type: application/octet-stream\r\naccept: */*\r\ncontent-length: 352\r\naccept-encoding: gzip,deflate\r\nHost: localhost:1234\r\nFiddler-Encoding: base64\r\n\r\nH4sIAAAAAAAACmWPX0+DMBTFv0ufsfLPTUn2YNZs0U1lmhAyo6aDMktoC21XZITvbtkeXOLbvb9zcs89PeCYERCBQgjgAEOkooLb3YMudC2RpDlQSRSIerATQistcW31zxB6MACDA3JSE54TntF/rv7i4NnvAMo12UuqO8vUN77x/CuJFg/HfZqJwi1RVz4LVZrwjYvpNA1Xh5gsfpZ+ut0a73qV3aLXZJnco1xsuu4lQW3crIMJQkzPNztZP80bU8frx43bzmZgGMY8pXFVgej9Y2zDhCHnmRGNc6zx+Cav2dffqxPon7pzkZMLbDwX3p2EusK6EJJZ2FIe+DboF6BsoeJJAQAA\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue in this request is that *any* webserver that does request filtering will throw a `400 Bad request` as a response. Why? The issue is in having the `content-type` header sent twice:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontent-type: application/json\r\ncontent-type: application/octet-stream\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving looked in the NPM source code, the `npm audit` command sets its header here:\r\nhttps://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/lib/install/audit.js#L90\r\n\r\nHave a good look, as there is nothing wrong here. Except, take note that the header is CamelCase `Content-Type`.\r\n\r\nDiving into making the request, we can see this block:\r\nhttps://github.com/npm/npm-registry-fetch/blob/latest/index.js#L39\r\n\r\nThe check that happens there checks lowercase `content-type`, and when that does not exist, adds `content-type: application/octet-stream`.\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging, I found this to be the issue of seeing duplicate headers.\r\n\r\nHow to fix? There are two potential fixes, and I created a PR for one.\r\n\r\n* Fix 1 - Make sure headers are added lowercase in https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/lib/install/audit.js#L90 - PR: https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/62\r\n* Fix 2 - Always make header keys lowercase in this function: https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-fetch/blob/latest/index.js#L156\r\n\r\n### Platform Info\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm --versions\r\n{ npm: '6.2.0',\r\n  ares: '1.14.0',\r\n  cldr: '33.1',\r\n  http_parser: '2.8.0',\r\n  icu: '62.1',\r\n  modules: '64',\r\n  napi: '3',\r\n  nghttp2: '1.32.0',\r\n  node: '10.9.0',\r\n  openssl: '1.1.0i',\r\n  tz: '2018e',\r\n  unicode: '11.0',\r\n  uv: '1.22.0',\r\n  v8: '6.8.275.24-node.14',\r\n  zlib: '1.2.11' }\r\n$ node -p process.platform\r\nwin32\r\n```",
