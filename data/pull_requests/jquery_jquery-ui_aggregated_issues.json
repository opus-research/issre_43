I will, but I'm not sure about how to test this one, I should test when handles are overlapping and you click on rigth/left side, instead of trying to move the last one touched it should move the left/rigth handle correspondingly. Will ``click`` simulate over ``element`` slider work?",

The issue is caused when the defaultDate, minDate, or maxDate setting option is given as a date string that is not in the specified dateFormat, the year is set 2028 and no error is thrown. \r\n\r\nI was thinking that some code could be added to ensure that if the defaultDate, minDate, or maxDate is given as a date string that it is in the specified format, or else alert the user, as the user is not being alerted to the inconsistency in formatting.\r\n\r\nThanks again for taking the time to respond. I am looking to get experience contributing to open-source, but if if the project stage is not ideal for this, no worries ",

Happy new year!\r\n\r\nI'm not that familiar with the Datepicker code as I only worked on the never published rewrite of it (Calendar and Datepicker 2.0).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't see why we should test with other values than documented. So the current code of the PR seems valid to me.

    "body": "Bootstrap uses events which need to include a namespace. E.g. the event name to bind to showing a modal is `show.bs.modal`. Just setting the event on `show` will not work.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```js\r\n$(document).on('show', '.modal', function() { console.log('this will never get fired')});\r\n$(document).on('show.bs.modal', '.modal', function() { console.log('this will be fired')})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue when using jquery-UI's `_on` method is that the namespace gets cut off. So this will not work:\r\n```js\r\n$.widget('mywidget', {\r\n    _create: function() {\r\n        this._on({\r\n            'show.bs.modal .modal': function() {\r\n                alert('this will not be fired');\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is the regex in the `_on` method. It does not allow a dot in the event name and also it searches for zero to unlimited amount of spaces to split of the selector.\r\nThis results into the following:\r\n```js\r\nvar match = event.match( /^([\\w:-]*)\\s*(.*)$/ );\r\nvar eventName = match[ 1 ] + instance.eventNamespace; // \"show.mywidget\"\r\nvar selector = match[ 2 ]; // \".bs.modal .modal\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo prevent this I changed the regex to also allow dots so namespaces will not be broken apart and also to require at least one whitespace.\r\n```js\r\nvar match = event.match( /^([\\w:.-]*)\\s+(.*)$/ );\r\nvar eventName = match[ 1 ] + instance.eventNamespace; // \"show.bs.modal.mywidget\"\r\nvar selector = match[ 2 ]; // \".modal\"\r\n```",

Please use <code>node-version</code> input instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fix logic of error handling for npm warning and uncaught exception</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we fix logic of error handling related to caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/358\">actions/setup-node#358</a>) and (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/359\">actions/setup-node#359</a>).</p>\n<p>In the previous behaviour we relied on <code>stderr</code> output to throw error. The warning messages from package managers can be written to the stderr's output. For now the action will throw an error only if exit code differs from zero. Besides, we add logic to сatch and log unhandled exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <code>node-version-file</code> input and update <code>actions/cache</code> dependency to the latest version.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>The new input (<code>node-version-file</code>) provides functionality to specify the path to the file containing Node.js's version with such behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the file does not exist the action will throw an error.</li>\n<li>If you specify both <code>node-version</code> and <code>node-version-file</code> inputs, the action will use value from the <code>node-version</code> input and throw the following warning: <code>Both node-version and node-version-file inputs are specified, only node-version will be used</code>.</li>\n<li>For now the action does not support all of the variety of values for Node.js version files. The action can handle values according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node#supported-version-syntax\">documentation</a> and values with <code>v</code> prefix (<code>v14</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - name: Setup node from node version file\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n    with:\n      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'\n  - run: npm install\n  - run: npm test\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Update actions/cache dependency to 1.0.8 version.</h2>\n<p>We updated actions/cache dependency to the latest version (1.0.8). For more information please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md\">toolkit/cache</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add &quot;cache-hit&quot; output</h2>\n<p>This release introduces a new output: <code>cache-hit</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/327\">#327</a>).</p>\n<p>The <code>cache-hit</code> output contains boolean value indicating that an exact match was found for the key. It shows that the action uses already existing cache or not. The output is available only if cache is enabled.</p>\n<h2>Support caching for mono repos and repositories with complex structure</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/305\">#305</a>).</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (<code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code>) in the repository root. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories. This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<p>Yaml example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yml\"><code>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

      "Triggering the \"input\" event is needed for the same reason it currently triggers the \"change\" event: because the contents of the input have changed and anything watching that input for changes should be notified. \r\n\r\nThere are interoperability problems without this. For example, we are working with a system that watches all form inputs for changes via each of their \"input\" events. Using the Datepicker, it has created a situation where the input it is attached to does not trigger the \"input\" event after its value has changed via a date being chosen. \r\n\r\nIs there currently a test testing that `.trigger(\"change\")` triggers the change event? If so, I can duplicate that test to test that `.trigger(\"input\")` triggers the \"input\" event.",
      "@worpet Thanks for the input! To me, this change sounds legit but I'm unsure if this will breaks stuff for people. \r\n\r\nRegarding tests, take a look here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/main/tests/unit/datepicker/events.js#L29\r\n\r\n@mgol What do you thin about this?",
      "> For example, we are working with a system that watches all form inputs for changes via each of their \"input\" events. \r\n\r\nIs this a jQuery-based system? Triggering an `input` event in jQuery only effects jQuery. The `input` event arrived a few years after jQuery was written so, for AFAIK, there's no use of it in jQuery core or UI. ",
      "@dmethvin Yes, it is primarily a jQuery system. I understand that jQuery UI stopped active development before this event became widely supported. In jQuery core, the \"input\" event is supported the same as any other event (you can add listeners for it or trigger it). We are using the Datepicker as a convenient way to add a calendar to relevant inputs. It works well, except it does not trigger the \"input\" event after changing the input's value.\r\n\r\nI understand if you're not interested in adding this, but it seemed like an easy and straightforward change that can extend the useful life of Datepicker.\r\n",
      "@worpet I am trying to understand the situation. If we determine a way to do this without changes to jQuery UI then you can use the current version and don't need to wait for a new release. Is this a blocker to your work? What are you doing at the moment? If the other parts of the system are jQuery it seems like you could use the `change` event since it's already triggered at the exact moment that `input` would be triggered.",
      "@fnagel You marked it as Behavior Change; do you consider it requiring a minor version bump?\r\n\r\n@dmethvin In many cases it's probably the easiest to just listen for the `change` event. But if one's working with a generic wrapper system accepting multiple components and reacting for changes, it may be less trivial to special-case datepicker.\r\n\r\n@worpet In general, semantics of the input & change event are different; `input` fires more often. Is datepicker the only place needing such a change? In the case of datepicker, is it enough to just trigger both events here?",
      "@mgol Adding an event looks like a change that could break things for people. So a minor release would be a good thing in theory.  Not sure if it's worth the wait though.\r\n\r\n",
      "@dmethvin Our workaround is to use Datepicker's \"onSelect\" option to fire the \"input\" event, since that is when the calendar's value is synced to the input's value. So this change is not critical for us, but I thought I would try contributing since it would be nice if it worked out of the box.\r\n\r\n@mgol This is a good point that adding \"input\" to only Datepicker may make it inconsistent with the other widgets that remain without it.",
      "The jQuery UI codebase seems largely unaware of the `input` event but there's one place where it's been taken into account, in autocomplete: #275. However, that change just listenes for the event, it doesn't trigger one.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, adding support for the `input` event won't be a straight addition to where the change is being fired. But it seems in case of datepicker those are largely interchangeable in my testing, a few test native inputs: https://jsfiddle.net/m_gol/cj80m3g7/10/.\r\n\r\nIt might be fine to do this change just for the datepicker; folks interested in other widgets could submit separate PRs. What do you think, @fnagel?\r\n\r\n@worpet before we can accept a PR, it would still need tests.",
      "@mgol I'm against changing this for Datepicker only, making it the only widget triggering the input event. I would like to keep a little consistency here. I'm fine with a PR changing it for all, but this seems a more complex task. \r\n\r\nAs @worpet mentioned, the workaround here is pretty straight forward, so I'm more likely to vote against this PR. Sorry @worpet :-(",

      "Widget: Optimize attachment of the _untrackClassesElement listener\n\njQuery UI 1.13.0 changed the logic attaching the `_untrackClassesElement`\r\nlistener in the `_classes` widget method; one of the side effects was calling\r\n`this._on` for each node that needed the listener. That caused a severe\r\nperformance degradation for large comboboxes as each `_on` jQuery UI call\r\ncauses a jQuery `add` call that calls Sizzle's `uniqueSort` underneath.\r\n\r\nInstead, collect the nodes that need the listener and then, outside of the loop,\r\ncreate a jQuery object out of them and attach the listener once. That's still\r\nslower than the jQuery 1.12 version but only slightly: 936 ms to 1.03s on a very\r\nlarge list on a recent MacBook Pro, compared to ~30 seconds before this patch.\r\n\r\nFixes gh-2014\r\nCloses gh-2037"

Then, copy the full commit ID of a commit you want to test.\r\n\r\nNext, make sure you have the latest version of https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com. Then you need to open `config.json` and change the `version` field from `1.13.0-rc.2` to the commit ID you copied before. Delete the `jquery-ui` folder in the repo. I found that having both a recent commit ID in one entry and `1.13.0-rc.2` in a separate one doesn't work; the RC.2 version is served for the new entry as well. You can download the RC.2 themes from the official site for comparison since you won't have them in your local Download Builder due to this quirk.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, run the following commands:\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\ngrunt prepare\r\nnode server.js --console\r\n```\r\nand open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

    "body": "Add a new option named `onUpdateDatepicker` that allows a custom callback to be provided. If provided, the callback is called at the end of `$.datepicker._updateDatepicker`.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is not a good way to manipulate the DOM for the datepicker calendar. Using a common example, if you want to add a custom button, you have to do it in a callback on both `beforeShow` and `onChangeMonthYear`.\r\n\r\nIf using an inline datepicker, you also have to add the custom button in `onSelect`. Furthermore, If you call `$('.my-date-picker').datepicker('refresh');`, the custom button goes away and there is no callback option or event to use for adding it back.\r\n\r\n[Here is one of many stackoverflow.com posts on this problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4598850/how-do-you-add-buttons-to-a-jquery-datepicker-in-the-button-panel).\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult _(sometimes impossible)_ to customize the datepicker calendar using the provided options, which leads to horrible hacks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$.datepicker._base_updateDatepicker = $.datepicker._updateDatepicker;\r\n$.datepicker._updateDatepicker = function (inst) {\r\n    this._base_updateDatepicker(inst);\r\n    // do custom stuff\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIdeally, datepicker would trigger events like `afterUpdate.datepicker` and developers could then easily add event handlers to customize the behavior. However, since this isn't the current approach, I chose to add another callback option named `onUpdateDatepicker` that is always called _(if defined)_ at the end of `_updateDatepicker`. This is a quick and easy solution that follows the current conventions of datepicker.\r\n\r\nThe following can now be used to customize the calendar **in one place**:\r\n\r\n```.js\r\n$('.my-date-picker').datepicker({\r\n    onUpdateDatepicker: function(inst) {\r\n        // do custom stuff\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nI didn't see anything on how to update the documentation. If someone can please point me in the right direction, I will include updates for https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/.",

What do you think? How to deal with the needed docs update? \r\n\r\nToo bad the rewrite has never been released. It's using the widget factory and is much easier to extend :-(\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/datepicker/ui/widgets/calendar.js\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/datepicker/ui/widgets/datepicker.js",

How to deal with the needed docs update?\r\n\r\n@fnagel I cloned api.jqueryui.com and started updating `datepicker.xml` to include this option. However, I don't see how to provide example code for the option. For example, looking at the `prevText` option on that page I see code examples:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18024854/118349415-25062600-b516-11eb-87ec-6b03f44f2d18.png)\r\n\r\nBut looking at [`prevText` in `datepicker.xml`](https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/main/entries/datepicker.xml#L377-L379) I don't see where that's defined. I global searched the repo for `prevText` (and some other options with examples) but could not find where these examples are defined. Can you let me know how, as I'd like to include examples.",
      " > The commit message \"Datepicker: improve callbacks test for onUpdateDatepicker \" should read \"Datepicker: **I**mprove callbacks test for onUpdateDatepicker\"\r\n\r\n@fnagel I've updated the commit message 🙂\r\n\r\n",
      "@patrick-vandy I did a bit of research and it seems code examples are generated based on metadata using one of the patterns from the https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content repository. This particular example is using this pattern:\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/4534d3e6771cfea2d69a110d65cf33b88467a764/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L594-L653\r\n\r\nI'd start with making sure the new option is properly documented in the signatures section in `entries/datepicker.xml` and there's a chance the example will be generated automatically if you fill in all required fields.",
      "@fnagel @mgol Okay, I've opened https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/334 to add this new option to the documentation. Let me know if there's anything else that needs to happen.\r\n\r\nAlso, I just realized on this PR I committed to `master` (though it looks like jQuery is using `main` now) instead of creating a feature branch on my fork. I can make a new branch off `main` and cherry pick my commits from this PR into a feature branch, then reopen a PR. Let me know if I should do that.",

      "In this configuration I was able to update grunt to the latest version and have it _still_ process & test the files without failure.  \r\n\r\nI would recommend migrating away from jscs to eslint as the jscs team has been working with eslint for some time (please see the [node-jscs repo](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs), their [Medium article](https://medium.com/@markelog/jscs-end-of-the-line-bc9bf0b3fdb2) and [user guide for migrating to eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-from-jscs)).  However, that being said, I've attempted this locally, and the tests resulted in failure because of syntax errors (mainly with spacing) which I believe may be related to the jquery eslint rule set.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, there was some CSS & HTML syntax rule issues when I upgraded grunt-contrib-csslint and grunt-html to latest.\r\n\r\nI can upgrade these as well, however that would mean addressing the syntax issue(s) as well.  If that's not an issue, I can proceed with that as well.  \r\n",

Which files do you have in mind here? `.jshintrc`, `.csslintrc` and `.gitattributes`?",
      "@fnagel In my experience, using a list of files/directories to _include_ as opposed of a list to exclude usually scales better. There is always a new IDE that will add its own directory that we wouldn't want to publish. On the other hand, we're using jquery-release here that always works with a fresh repo clone so it won't have this type of files/directories. So maybe there's no real risk here.\r\n\r\nThe list looks good to me. I haven't checked if we can exclude more but the current list looks good to exclude. Core also doesn't include Grunftfile or linter config files, or tests in its published bundle, compare the files/directories at https://github.com/jquery/jquery with https://unpkg.com/browse/jquery@3.5.1/.",

    "body": "Copied from https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15271:\r\n\r\nDuring automated testing the autocomplete menu sometimes selects the wrong item upon click.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced by making a page with a normal autocomplete input with a couple of options. The tests populate the text of the input after which the menu opens. Then, the desired item is clicked. Even though the click event reports the correct item was clicked, the item which is actually selected by the autocomplete plugin may be a different one.\r\n\r\nI could only reproduce this in automated tests and not by hand. The issue is most probably related to the tests not firing all events that would fire during normal operation. This is actually mentioned in a comment in Menu#select (​https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/menu.js#L673):\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// TODO: It should never be possible to not have an active item at this\r\n// point, but the tests don't trigger mouseenter before click.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe item to be selected is determined by the following line:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthis.active = this.active || $( event.target ).closest( \".ui-menu-item\" );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, if this.active has not been properly set by preceding events, the wrong element may be selected.\r\n\r\nI propose the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthis.active = $( event.target ).is( \".ui-menu-item\" ) ? $( event.target ) :\r\n    this.active || $( event.target ).closest( \".ui-menu-item\" );\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, if the target element is a menu item, then it is used as the active element. Otherwise, determine the active element as per usual. One might even add an explicit check for the event type, if necessary.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing this in 1.11.4, but the error is still present in master at the time of writing (1.12.1). Additionally:\r\n- jQuery 2.1.4\r\n- Chrome 63\r\n- Ubuntu 16.04 and Arch",

      "I saw a few comments from his twitter feed in 2016 and 2017 that, if you read between the lines, would indicate that the project was over encumbered with bureaucracy (read as legal) and that there may have been issues with the cadence of the project that were suffocating both the project and it's key developer.  \r\n\r\nIt's sad to see such a huge contributor move on, but we all have lives to live and priorities do change.  I mean like, for example, raising and feeding ones young and growing family.  Those things should be the most important things in each and every one of our lives, because in the end, no one get's out of this life alive and its no fun being alone.\r\n\r\nThat being said, jQuery and jQueryUI are important tools for projects throughout the planet.  May they continue to develop and evolve.  I, for one, hope this project, as well as jQuery, can keep its center and move forward into the future.",
      "Legal issues were part of it, but there were a lot of other issues from the foundation as well. There was a quick downward spiral when Kris Borchers took over as Executive Director for jQuery Foundation. Since then the foundation stopped hosting conferences (which doubled as team and board meetings), the individual membership program was cancelled, all of the most active directors from the board were removed one by one in \"clever\" ways, and our budgets were severely cut.\r\n\r\nAt this point, there is practically no organization within the foundation. All of their initiatives have had no visible progress, most of the infrastructure and content is unmaintained (the foundation as a whole maintained about two dozen sites with a lot of custom infrastructure behind it), and they tout transparency while being ridiculously opaque with their operations. Legal changes were forced upon all projects with no discussion and the legal team refused to engage in conversations about differences in understanding of the changes.\r\n\r\nKris also lied to the Dojo Foundation about how the projects would be treated and the support the foundation would provide when they approached them to merge with jQuery Foundation and rebrand as JS Foundation. Part of the merger included adding @dylans as a director to represent the incoming projects. During the rebranding as JS Foundation, Kris once again used his clever ways to kick Dylan off the board.\r\n\r\nI kept quiet about all of the internal problems for a few years, but it has gotten to the point where I am willing to publicly discuss anything and everything about my experiences with the foundation. I will say that if anyone is wondering why there hasn't been a single commit to master in a full year, it's because the foundation created a situation in which developers who once were willing to commit 20, 40, even 70 hours per week to jQuery-related projects now have no desire to interact with the foundation in any way.",
      "@scottgonzalez Why not fork this great project and keep maintaining it?  The license will allow it I believe and there is no need to keep it under the Foundation if the Foundation is no longer supporting or maintaining it?",

      "Based on test failures (amended), it looks like the treatment of an empty string as value to be overwritten by label text was by design, but the PR is to change that behavior.\r\n\r\nI am using empty string values as an indication of no match, where the label is my message for \"no match found\" and the value should remain an empty string, which disables the message from being selectable (using _renderItem and forking rendering based on the item value being empty). The same behavior is indicated when there is an error from the remote service, and a message should go in the label but the value should remain empty.\r\n\r\nIf you feel the current behavior is correct, maybe an update to the documentation should explain.

      "You cited two use cases that you're trying to solve: An error response and disabled items. Using an empty value for those cases is really just a hack. If you have an error that you'd like to report to the user, you should handle that inside your `source` option.\r\n\r\nFor disabled items, you can provide as many additional properties as you'd like on your item objects (This is likely what's missing from the docs). This allows you to provide a `disabled` property which would provide much more semantic value. You can then use the rendering extension points to take the `disabled` property into account.",
      "Thanks for your explanations, Scott. I've cloned the docs repo, and will try to set myself up to add some commentary outlining what you've said.\r\n\r\nIt's true that handling service errors this way would be a hack, but the app I'm working on is already hack-central without good error handling. In any case, you're right about that.\r\n\r\nI'm fine with the idea of using an additional property for indicating items that should be rendered as disabled, and I agree that should be added to the docs, so I'll do my best to contribute something to that effect. The current behavior should also be a little more fully documented, as you've laid out. \r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to discuss with me. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJosh"

I have made some rearrangement of the code to address issues related to performance (all fairly common sense) but you may find some of these rearrangements disconcerting given the age of this code.\r\nI will leave this pull request open and will attempt to free up some time next week to create jsFiddle's related to functionality differences so that you can visually access what has changed.\r\nAnthony\r\n",

Beyond what I have committed here, I have further changes that target other scrollable related issues as well as addressing autoscrolling, but I did not provide these here as they are fairly far a field from what I would consider the jQuery ui standard.

The only thing I could potentially see an issue with is if someone has attempted to fix them via callbacks previous and then introduce these changes leading to conflict.  Something to consider given what I've seen others attempt on StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming you have looked over these changes?  Did you see anything that concerned you?\r\n\r\nIf you're so inclined, check out: https://github.com/borgboyone/jQuery-UI-ScrollPane/blob/master/src/jquery-ui-scrollsortable-autoscroll.js It's not a version I would recommend for the main stream, but it has some tidbits you might find interesting and it essentially \"fixes\" the scrollbar movement issue associated with the non atomic operation of absolute positioning (popping out) of the helper and dropping in the placeholder.

      "@scottgonzalez \r\nLine numbers reference the incoming version\r\n\r\n#3173: (1106-1114)\r\nThe majority of solutions presented on SO only implement 1106-1107 but the full solution needs the additional 1109-1114.\r\n\r\n#15165: (353-401, 426)\r\nSelf-explanatory\r\n\r\n#15166: (429, 852-877, 887)\r\nThis issue is treated mainly as an annoyance and not a functional show stopper.  Unfortunately, I didn't have that luxury.  An attempt was made to switch the comparison reference so that the item offsets were absolute to the scrollparent and the mouse position was translated to that reference but this required to much of a rewrite so I didn't pursue this route further.  The easiest thing to do was just to update the item positions if a scroll occurred.  You'll notice that a slight discrepancy in the overlap detection the height of an item (y-axis dragging) may still occur.  This is due to #15175.  \"Fixing\" #15175 removes all issues associated with the helper/item intersection that I could see.\r\n\r\n#15167: (198-202, 333-339, 1130)\r\nThis issue was almost a show stopper for me in using ui.sortable in a specific project.  It was either fix it or move on to a from scratch solution or find something else.  There is a lot of SO traffic on this issue as well. \r\n\r\n#15168: (259-265, 1107)\r\nSelf-explanatory\r\n\r\n#15169: (422, 1036)\r\nIt's very odd behavior to have scrolling of the last container occur when the helper is outside of any sortable container.  This isn't a necessary fix but it helps with the user experience.\r\n\r\n#15170: (419-420, 422, 1036)\r\nThis was in an attempt to improve performance especially where large number of sortable items were involved and multiple connected sortables were involved.\r\n\r\n(437-440, 694-695, 709-710)\r\nI left this in mainly as a precursor to future enhancements.  I take advantage of these values for the autoscroll feature (where you simply hold the mouse at the edge(s)) and scrolling occurs with out the need for mouse movement.  I also limited scrolling to mouse direction, so if you're coming into a container it doesn't autoscroll.  I did not include these changes in the pull request but I thought I'd mention them.\r\n\r\nHaving written this out, it doesn't feel like a lot of changes.  However, they do inherently change some internal processing that has been around for a while.  Personally, I'd like to see more testing of a few of these changes in remarkably different usage situations...something outside of my working frame of reference.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I leave it to you to decide what to include, if anything, and what to exclude, if nothing.\r\nAnthony\r\n",
      "I'm going to merge the whole thing. It seems like you've got a good understanding of this code and if any regressions do pop up, you should be able to address them. So even though I'm a little nervous about this, I'm going to land it since overall it will be an improvement.",
      "Changes from this PR broke sortable in the very simple case, see #1998. I'll try to understand what may be happening here but if by any chance you're available, @borgboyone (I know, it's been a while) then I'd appreciate any help you could provide.",
      "Another regression caused by this PR: #2001. In this one I don't see any CSS issues in the test case as in #1998 so it might be a real bug, not just a compatibility issue with UI 1.12.1."

There is a flag to instruct the control to ignore blurs, but it was getting\r\ncleared too quickly; when the code refocused the input after it was blurred,\r\nIE would send *another* blur event, which wasn't getting ignored and would\r\nclose the dropdown. We now wait for the focus/blur pair to process before\r\nclearing the flag.\r\n\r\n2. We remove the tabindex from the dropdown menu, which prevents menu's focus\r\nhandler from firing.

      "> ...we already have several copies of jQuery in the repo and every use of node when working on jQuery UI will use the ones in the repo\r\n\r\nSo this issue is easily solved by using jQuery as a dependency within nested `package.json` files within the repo.\r\n\r\nAn npm script such as `cd test/tests && npm update --cache-min=Infinity` would do the trick.

There have been some really good [advancements](http://donejs.com/Features.html#section=section_Server_SideRendered) in server-side rendering of single-page apps based around [zones](https://www.npmjs.com/package/can-zone). In order to support this, the [StealJS](http://stealjs.com/) loader has env-base configuration overrides for loading packages with node.

      "> Is this a change that would be interesting to merge into jQuery UI? In that case, are there any changes to the implementation, or the commit messages, that have to be done?\r\n\r\nYes, this is something we would be interested in merging. Historically, we just used the deprecated methods as long as possible since that's the easiest solution for supporting so many versions of jQuery Core. However, we have switched to a different model where we upgrade to using the new APIs without any checks and then load in compatibility layers to support older versions of jQuery. You can see how we handle this in [/ui/jquery-1-7.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/cc37fe76aac4a09c37de83178e2c818c4400dff6/ui/jquery-1-7.js).\r\n\r\nI'd suggest adding `/ui/jquery-1-9.js` for `jQuery.expr.pseudos` and `/ui/jquery-1-11.js` for `.uniqueSort()`. The conditionals and assignments you have seem fine. You'll need to add the two new files as dependencies for `/ui/core.js` which will cause them to be included in the full build, but can easily be excluded in a custom build.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

      "If the introduction of new modules is a breaking change, then maybe another change could be made? Instead of a 1.7 polyfill, a 1.9 polyfill, a 1.12 polyfill etc., there could be a 1.x polyfill for all jQuery versions 1.x. (Considering jQuery 2.0 was released in April 2013, it shouldn't be a big burden for people on jQuery 1.12.3 to include the whole 1.x polyfill)",
      "Introducing a 1.x module still requires 1.13.0, though I'm not against that idea. 1.7 is the heaviest, but it's really not a big price to pay for 1.x support in general, despite the fact that very few sites (comparatively) actually use 2.x or 3.x.\r\n\r\nUsing statistics from builtwith.com, 1.7.x accounts for about 6.5% of jQuery usage, at ~4.4M sites. All 2.x releases only amount to a quarter of that. 3.x releases are so unpopular that they don't even report usage statistics for it yet. However, these stats don't say anything about rate of release and update.\r\n\r\nBarring any objections from @jquery/ui, I'd accept a PR that merged all of the files together (you can even just update this PR).",
      "A single module for jQuery \"adapters\" seems fine to me. These new ones are just one liners and don't need their own files.",
      "How about we just use the existing `jquery-1-7` module as the generic jQuery 1.x support module during 1.12? The name is a bit strange, but we can just say it's defining the lowest version that the module adds support for. We can rename it in 1.13 so that there is no version number (or make it just `jquery-1`).\r\n\r\n@eirslett Would you like to make that change?

That way we make sure that the tests pass in different timezones. Not necessarily in all of them, but testing 2 is much better than just the default.\n\nIts also possible that these issues only affect the testsuite, in which case it might be much more pragmatic to just set a fixed timezone.\n",

So based on what I could gather I’d say remove it, but maybe I’m missing some context.\"\n\n@klown said: \"There is a new section in the ARIA 1.1 draft spec that describes cases where applying role=\"presentation\" has no effect; indeed, where user agents are required to ignore the role and use the native semantic.

      "GitHub ate the script tag in my URL. Try this:\nhttp://server/path/to/search.php?callback=[script]alert(1)[/script]&term=X\nbut replace the square brackets with angle brackets.\n",
      "So this is about linking directly to `search.php` and injecting HTML, not about injecting JS in the JSONP request. Simply passing the callback through `htmlspecialchars()` would prevent someone from pretending to load a real page and won't break any valid callback names. \n",
      "htmlspecialchars() would also work, however I personally prefer the validation approach over escaping here, since a callback name with (for instance) angle brackets should lead to nothing being returned. \n\nThe proposed fix works for the sample code. If someone is changing the example, e.g. by using a callback name with unicode characters, it's probably their responsibility to adapt the PHP script, as well. If you wish, I could amend the PR to use htmlspecialchars() despite my reservations. \n\nAnyway, this must be fixed asap, since the same file is also residing on the jqueryui.com domain. \n"

GUI mirroring is strongly associated with translation of UI to Arabic / Hebrew. At the same time, GUI mirroring is mostly concerned with graphical layout of screen and widget. \n\nAs opposed to that, this specific PR is concerned with text only (which can appear as part of widget). Thus this PR is completely orthogonal to GUI direction and #1682 .\n\nJust FYI. My team and our colleagues from Egypt Bidi center (who authored #1682) work together to address variety of Bidi requirements in open source tools / libraries. \n",
      "I have not reviewed this at all yet simply read the discription. Just one minor thing i noticed from that is any time we have an \"auto\" option like this that determines the value used based on DOM etc, we always use the special value `null` to denote it. so in this case the 3 values should be `\"ltr\"`, `\"rtl\"`, and `null`. `null` should be the default value. When the value `null` is used and `rtl` or `ltr` chosen based on markup during init, the option value should be set as well. In this way when a developer checks the value of the option it should always return `rtl`  or `ltr` and never `null` \n",
      "@scottgonzalez may I kindly inquire which release are we waiting for to start the review ? I believe 3.2 was out in March 2017.",
      "Let's focus on a single widget to have our discussions. I'll pick button since it's the first widget in the `textDir.html` demo and is fairly simple. Please explain exactly what the button widget is accounting for with text direction that isn't already handled natively by `dir=\"rtl\"`.",
      "@scottgonzalez button is not the best example to illustrate the benefit of textDir parameter. This is mostly since button has horizontally symmetrical graphics (just a rectangular area without any shade) and thus it looks (from graphical perspective) exactly the same with both LTR and RTL directions. However even for the button there is a minor benefit. Please observe that textDir is meant to affect text only. Currently if you specify dir=\"ltr\" or dir=\"rtl\" for button you don't cover auto direction (aka contextual or first stong) for text label displayed as part of the button. You can specify dir=\"auto\" for button but this won't work at least not on IE. Thus having textDir even in the case of button has some benefit. \r\n\r\nIn general textDir has striking benefit for widgets which are horizontally asymmetrical. For example, combo box, list box (with scroll bar), check box, tree, grid etc.  When you want to flip horizontally such widgets you usually specify dir=\"ltr\" or dir=\"rtl\". However, this by itself does not allow you to enforce text direction for text displayed in such widgets independently from GUI direction. For example if you specify dir=\"rtl\" for combo box, all text inside such combo box will be displayed with RTL direction. However if you wish this text to be displayed with LTR direction you have no such option. Having textDir parameter allows you to control text direction of text inside a widget independently from direction of widget graphics. \r\n\r\nFor the sake of example, please observe the behavior of native controls on iOS / Android platforms. Text in such controls is displayed by default with textDir = \"auto\" regardless of direction of control's graphics (dir =\"ltr\" or dir =\"rtl\"). By the way majority of desktop technologies (including native mobile libraries) allow to control direction of text independently from widget (or GUI) direction.  For example: \r\n\r\n- Direction of GUI (or widget) is called by **Android** _layoutDirection_ (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setLayoutDirection%28int%29) . It is equivalent to HTML dir specified for a widget.\r\n- Text direction (for text displayed inside a widget) is called by **Android** _textDirection_ (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setTextDirection%28int%29). It is equivalent to HTML dir specified on the text inline element itself. ",
      "Thanks for the explanation on the two different direction settings. Now that I have a better understanding of the specific goal trying to be accomplished, I will take another look at the changes.",

While they're supposed to be API-compatible with 1.x counterparts the internal code is different so they may be subtle bugs.\n\nWe have the ability to test locally, but we don't test against 2.x in CI. This was done so long ago, I honestly don't remember the reasoning. I can't think of any problems with adding it, we'll just need to use different browser sets.\n\n> It seems weird to me to test all 4 patch releases of 1.11.x but not to test even one 2.1.x.\n\nRe: all 4 patch releases; we'll probably never test against only the latest patch version because that's just not how developers actually work.\n\nRe: 2.1.x; As I said above, I'm ok with adding this now.\n",
      "> What's the purpose of the jquery-1.x entry in bower.json & in the external directory?\n\nI'm not sure what you're asking. Are you asking why we have all the 1.x versions?

      "> We have the ability to test locally, but we don't test against 2.x in CI. This was done so long ago, I honestly don't remember the reasoning.\n\nI see. From what I remember the browser set used for testing was hardcoded in the UI repo but now different jobs can use different browser sets (I did it so that UI could be tested against jQuery 3.0.0 WIP) so this can be done. I can update this PR & create proper Jenkins jobs or 2.0, 2.1 & 2.2.\n\n> I'm not sure what you're asking.

      "> Question: in wiki there is a \"Add change event (datepicker only)\" todo item, but we never added this to the specs. Do we want this event? And do we really want to add it datepicker only when it needs to be implemented in calendar anyway (I'm pretty sure about this)?\n\nWe have `select` which exists in both and is triggered only on a click or ENTER (actually, on `mousedown`, but I'm not sure why that is, seems like it should be on `click`)<sup>1</sup>. This will inform the user of all changes on the calendar. However, these events are not filtered, so selecting the currently selected date will result in another `select` event being triggered.\n\nFor datepicker, you can change the date without selecting a date from the calendar by typing a new date into the text input. On `blur`, we want to capture that the value has changed and trigger a `change` event. I assume this is why `change` is marked as datepicker only. I'm not strongly opposed to adding `change` to calendar, but it would be duplicative of `select` and would not have the additional useful cases that datepicker has.\n\nOn the other hand, we do have behavioral differences across widgets regarding programmatic value changes and triggering a `change` event. A widget like autocomplete which has no internal concept of a value will not trigger `change` on programmatic change of the input (because the value is changed outside of the widget). However, something like slider which has no concept of an external value will (because the value is changed inside the widget). So you could easily make the argument that calendar **should** have a `change` event and we should be triggering it whenever the value is changed programmatically. And if we're doing that, we should be triggering consistently when the value changes via any method.\n\nSO IN CONCLUSION, let's add `change` to both :-)\n\n_<sup>1</sup> We should also change ENTER to not trigger `mousedown`, but to instead just invoke a function which does the right thing._\n",
      "Thanks for your feedback! I will implement this soon.\n\n> We should also change ENTER to not trigger mousedown, but to instead just invoke a function which does the right thing.\n\nI actually already changed this in my latest local version due to inconsistent event return value and, well, because it looked just wrong :-D\n",

Since we can't stop IE from moving focus (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/52d9ec6c4d7402d5ef04b8c7959f812f8d095cef/ui/widgets/autocomplete.js#L227-L234), when the user interacts with the scrollbar, the input blurs and then gains focus again. When the field receives focus, the menu jumps back up. As a result, clicking on the scrollbar arrows always results in the menu scrolling to the top. This happens while using the scroll box as well, but since that sets an explicit scroll amount, the menu ends up in the right location after jumping to the top.\n\nWe should try to fix that, but it's not related to this change.\n",

Do we just not support it? Adding es5-shim helps, but then we run into other (unrelated) issues, apparently demos/bootstrap.js uses document.head, which IE8 doesn't support. Switching to document.body \"works\", but then it gets stuck somewhere else. Haven't yet been able to figure out where.~~ We won't support IE8, IE9 and IE10 in 1.13\n- [ ] Windows Phone 8.1 on a BrowserStack Nokia Lumia 930 loads, but draggable doesn't work at all; slider is usable, but the handle doesn't move while dragging, only updates when stopping. I tried the pep/paint sample on the same \"device\" and it works, so PEP itself seems to be okay.\n- [ ] PhantomJS 1.x doesn't have `Function#bind`, which is annoying, but easy enough to work around. It also doesn't have MutationObservers, which is a bigger issue (`PointerEventsPolyfill: MutationObservers not found, touch-action will not be dynamically detected`). PhantomJS 2.x is still not usable; [this seems to be the best issue to follow](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948).\n- [x] ~~Running tests/unit/all.html on Chrome/OSX has failures on dialog and draggable, but both also happen on master. Datepicker and effects tests also had failures on master, but those were easy to fix.~~ Fix for draggable is in #1618, can't reproduce dialog issue anymore.\n- [ ] Interactions+slider pass on Chrome/OSX and Chrome/Android 5.x. On Mobile Safari/iOS Simulator, draggable has lots of failures, and gets stuck on \"connectToSortable, dragging clone into sortable\" test. Droppable has 2 failures. Sortable has lots of failures. Slider has some failures, one due to a missing pointermove event (slider's slide event isn't triggered by `.simulate( \"drag\", { dx: 10, dy: 10 } )` call. Part of this is due to `window.scrollTo` behaving differently on iOS, see below.\n",

To show that this actually works, I've created a proper demo: https://github.com/jzaefferer/webpack-jquery-ui\n\nThat was inspired by this demo, which contained a lot of unrelated things: https://github.com/bebraw/jquery-ui-webpack-demo\nWhich in turn was using this `index.js` (default when `\"main\"` property isn't specified): https://github.com/bebraw/jquery-ui/commit/9574b6ede7287a39741410363745f625fabc1b01\n\nIt turned out that using an index file with a list of all components, besides the annoying maintenance, is also bad for webpack builds, since it ends up including _everything_ listed in that file. On the other hand, including specific components, like in my demo, only includes that component and its dependencies.\n\nWithout an `index.js` or the `main` property, the webpack build will fail. Since the content or value of the file or property doesn't matter, we should consider reporting this as a webpack bug (instead of considering it a feature). Would like to hear some opinions on that.\n\nAs for publishing on npm, I think we can just start doing that with 1.12. At least for webpack I don't see any need to change anything else. It likely won't work with browserify out of the box, since it doesn't resolve the AMD dependencies, but that shouldn't be our problem; an additional transform or other plugin should support that, like webpack does by default.\n",

This expands on that solution to fix http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12472. However, the problem comes from mouse, but the fix is inside draggable. This means that every other interaction has this problem as well. There's actually an old ticket that's properly categorized as being a mouse issue: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6642. So the question is, should we just fix the root cause now or just handle this in the interaction rewrite?\r\n\r\nAlso, how many and which test cases do we want to write? The DOM structures that exist are:\r\n- active element is the handle\r\n  - e.g., a draggable div which can gain focus\r\n- active element is a descendant of the handle\r\n  - e.g., an input inside a draggable that doesn't specify a handle (not great UX)\r\n- active element is an ancestor of the handle\r\n  - e.g., a draggable element inside a dialog\r\n- active element is not associated with the handle\r\n  - e.g., an input in another part of the document\r\n\r\nWe also have to consider which element the user is interacting with, as they can be interacting with the handle itself or a descendant of the handle. So it's possible that the active element is a descendant of the handle and the user is interacting with a descendant of the handle, but the active element and event target are siblings/cousins.\r\n",

This method unlike the native property also works on detached DOM nodes, and in browsers not supporting `control.labels`. \n\n`$.fn.form` which fixes the native `control.form` in IE8 where setting the `form` attribute breaks the `form` property by changing it to a string. \n\n`$.ui.escapeId` is a regex for escaping `id` and similar to be able to use them as jQuery selectors. Its needed anytime you are building a selector from the id or some other attribute of an element because there are characters valid in the HTML that need to be escaped when used as a selector. \n\nThis also updates selectmenu to use both `$.fn.labels` and `$.ui.escapeId` and it updates tabs to use `$.ui.escapeId`. `$.fn.form` is needed both by checkboxradio in the button rewrite but also by the from reset extension @scottgonzalez is working on. Checkboxradio will also use `$.ui.escapeId`. jquery-mobile will also use all three of these.\n\nNote: This does add 3 new exceptions to `htmllint:bad` for the labels tests. These are needed to make sure we match that native implementation. While the markup may not be valid it is supported by every browser, so it is required otherwise we could get label / input mismatches which would break visual state and underlying state consistency for inputs and labels in things like checkboxradio. Specifically this can happen with inputs wrapped in multiple labels, and inputs which are wrapped in a label which is associated with an input besides the one it contains based on its `for` attribute.\n",

I only fixed places that broke my webpage.\nSo I suggest you to create some kind of workaround similar to this pullrequest.\nI've searched for issue report button on your website and this repo too, but unsuccesfully.\nSo, this is not truly pull request, but issue report/feature request.

Its tests have been deactivated for now, along with resizable tests in draggable.\n\nAs a _temporary workaround_ for overloaded mouse functions I use temporary flags on the widget. It is not very pretty to look at and only intended as an intermediate solution.\n\nCredit for `interaction.js` goes to the interactions-polymer branch.\n\nI noticed that draggable extends and directly calls `_mouseUp`, thus widgets have the ability to stop a mouse interaction by directly calling `_mouseUp`. If I am not mistaken, the new interaction interface does not give such possibilities atm, since the `stopHandler` is only directly attached to the event listener. I currently mimic the behaviour by triggering an actual pointerup event. This does not seem ideal though.\n\nThe polyfill is (naturally) the latest build from https://github.com/jquery/PEP .\n\nLastly: While the unit tests in the browser are mostly green, phantomjs rather feels like wreaking havoc. I am not sure why that is.\n",

Its the same branch for now, but I pushed it to this repo, so that Jasper can contribute to it directly.\n\nI've been testing the new theme with Rafael in ThemeRoller and the custom demo that Download Builder creates. We noticed that the background of `.ui-widget-overlay` is darker than the `box-shadow` of `.ui-widget-shadow`, causing the shadow to disappear completely when on top of the overlay. In addition, the overlay doesn't need a background image, it works fine with just a color value. So our suggestion is to remove the `url()` from the overlay background, and change the color for overlay or shadow, or both, to work together.\n\n@jaspermdegroot would be great if you could look into the above.

I've tracked it down to the `_open` method, which first sets the given element as the content:\n\n``` js\ntooltip.find( \".ui-tooltip-content\" ).html( content );\n```\n\nThen it later reuses the same element to set it for the live region:\n\n``` js\n// HTMLElement has no clone() method\nif ( content.clone ) {\n    a11yContent = content.clone();\n    a11yContent.removeAttr( \"id\" ).find( \"[id]\" ).removeAttr( \"id\" );\n} else {\n    // So we end up using the element directly\n    a11yContent = content;\n}\n$( \"<div>\" ).html( a11yContent ).appendTo( this.liveRegion );\n```\n\nWhen passing an element to `.html()`, it behaves the same as calling `append`, so the element is removed from the tooltip and added to the live region instead.\n\nTo fix this we could just read the HTML from the tooltip element:\n\n``` js\na11yContent = $( \"<div>\" ).html( tooltip.find( \".ui-tooltip-content\" ).html() );\na11yContent.removeAttr( \"id\" ).find( \"[id]\" ).removeAttr( \"id\" );\na11yContent.appendTo( this.liveRegion );\n```\n\nThat works, in that it passes all existing tests.\n",

Indeed, the users may easily enter a two year digits date (quicker) even if we finally expect four year digits.\n\nMay I suggest this:\n- Be more permissive when parsing the year from the text input without changing the new behaviour of the parseDate() function.\n- Format the date correctly on change() event (per example), transforming the year in the real expected format (two or four digits) if needed.\n\nThe datepicker is, since 1.11, too restrictive for the text input and some users don't understand why their input is not understood by the datepicker.\n",

I think this is the only way to accomplish this.\n\nIt'd be good to have someone else verify this is working properly since I had to try lots of variations of this code to get it working everywhere and it's possible I overlooked something by the end. There are a few scenarios to test:\n- Interacting with the button and menu don't throw errors when there is no text selection.\n- Clicking the button should always focus the button, any existing text selection should be preserved.\n- Click a menu item should focus the button, any existing text selection should be preserved.\n- You should always be able to use the arrow keys on an open menu (because focus should be on the button).\n",

If you play with that value (which is currently `1em`) you can get the tests to pass and fail in various browsers. The previous value of `.4em` just happened to work. Some other values like `.9em` just happen to work as well. `1em` doesn't, so tests are currently failing.\n\nIn addition to the rounding differences, there's also [this check](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/450d75f912f4161c475f18f9eeb7efd307c02eae/ui/selectmenu.js#L518-521) that conditionally adds a pixel to the menu's width. If I comment out that check the tests pass with the current padding, but I assume the check is necessary.\n\nThe rounding error and the conditional check each have the ability to throw the test off by a pixel, therefore I switched the test to use `closeEnough()` to account for this. It's not ideal, but I can't think of a better way of handling this.\n\ncc @fnagel, @jzaefferer, @tcrowley\n",

An object evaluates to a logical true preserving the existing logic and the additional options are integrated into the animation options.\n\nThis should address #[3843](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3843) (already closed as fixed?)\nHowever, reading the description \"Resizable has an animate vent, but not animate callback because the animate option is used to determine if animation should occur\" I still don't see a way to add an animate callback which this pull request should solve like so:\n\n```\n$( \".selector\" ).resizable({\n    animate: {\n        start: function(animation){ //do callback here },\n        complete: function(){ // do callback here },\n        ...\n    }\n});\n```\n",

Menus only use active items for submenus, which we're not concerned about here. Prior to this change, the styling for the active/focused item was different immediately after opening a menu, but switched back to the standard focus styling as soon as any other interaction occurred (via mouse or keyboard).\n\nThe simplification of the focused item selection just avoids the roundtrip from selectmenu to menu to selectmenu. This change can be debated since it does create a difference in how items are selected (we're not always going through menu now), but the logic is exactly the same as before, with less overhead.\n\nWe're also wondering if we should change the label's `for` attribute as done on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/baf6bc5c27003468052d81589855b6587f004d94/ui/selectmenu.js#L73. Presumably this is left over from when we were using an actual button, so it could receive focus. However, now that we're using a span, browsers will not move focus even if the `for` attribute is updated. We should probably just use `aria-labelledby` on the span instead, but we'll need testing to make sure that we're not breaking anything in AT.\n",

This works, generating the cdn zip file correctly (getting there took most of the time). When I actually run this as part of jquery-release, I get the console output for \"Build CDN Package\", but it never outputs `\"Built zip CDN package at \" + path.relative( \"../..\", targetZip )`, which is baffling since the script still continue runnings, going to the \"PUSHING TAG\" step. So the output is literally this:\n\n``` sh\nBuild CDN Package\n\n##\n## PUSHING TAG\n##\n```\n\nJust a blank line inbetween, nothing else. I can't figure out why that happens. It certainly doesn't help that it takes a run of several minutes to even get to that point (which is why I created my separate test script in the first place, but that runs fine).\n\nOnce this is figured out, I still need to create the files for the CDN upload. This expects more files:\n\n```\ncp: no such file or directory: /Users/jza/dev/jquery-release/__release/repo/dist/cdn/*\n```\n\nWe may want to adjust this in jquery-release itself, not sure yet.\n",

I've used the same approach as core and sizzle, using grunt-bowercopy to replicate the existing files.\n\nThe biggest issue I see is the `jquery` dependency. Specifying `>=1.6` is nice to declare what version we depend on, but is wrong once we start actually using bower. With this in place, we end up installing `2.1.0`, which is most certainly not the right version. What we really want here is `1.10.2` or, if we were to use the latest 1.x version, `1.11.0`.\n\nWhich brings us to the next problem: Whatever that jQuery version is, it has no version in its file name, so we'd have to hard code that version in two places: Once in `bower.json`, once in the `Gruntfile` inside the `bowercopy` task. I think what we should do instead is this: Specify the actual jQuery version we want to use in `bower.json`, currently that should be `1.11.0`, then copy that to `jquery.js` in the root, and update all the references to `jquery-1.10.2.js` to just `jquery.js`. In the future we could update to newer jQuery versions by just specifying the new version in `bower.json` and running `grunt bowercopy` again.\n\nThere's a tiny shortcoming on `grunt-bowercopy` which I've [reported](https://github.com/timmywil/grunt-bowercopy/issues/14) there.\n\n`jquery-mousewheel` is an optional, non-dev dependency, since its by spinner (not just demos). I've currently put it under devDependencies, since there's no way to mark dependencies as optional (which is probably sane). Should this go into regular dependencies instead?\n\nBoth mousewheel and jshint can be updated to newer versions, that should happen after this is done. I don't want to clutter this PR with big diffs in `external/`. Even installing the same jshint version from bower causes some whitespace changes, keep that in mind when testing this PR locally.\n\nOverall I like this approach. Bowercopy allows us to keep our external dependencies in exactly the same place as before, while getting rid of manually updating files. Just need to figure out how to deal with our main dependency...\n",

It ensures that the jquery-ui CSS and Javascript performance hits are tracked across commits. \n\nThe useful metrics measured include\n1. Smoothness - measured by way of mean time to draw each frame while scrolling\n2. Page load time - measured using firstPaintTime and window.performance\n\nFor example, adding blurs, roudned corners or gradients could slow down a component.\nAdditionally, Javascript that adds additional listeners can make a page janky. With a graph tracking performance across commits, any issues introduced during the development process will not go unnoticed. \n## What has been added\n\nA new grunt task has been added that generates temporary files, runs the performance tests for them in saucelabs and reports back the results. The results are stored in a CouchDB Database. The CouchApp in the same database is used to view this data over commits.\n\nThis is based on http://axemclion.github.com/bootstrap-perf and is inspired by the work done with http://bench.topcoat.io.\nTo run the performance task, run grunt connect perf. I have not yet hooked it into travis yet, will do that once this proposal to add rendering tasks is accepted.\n## Notes\n1. The CouchDB database is temporary and needs to be changed to something that jquery owns. \n2. The graph will be available at http://coucdbserver/databasename/_design/site/index.html\n3. When running locally, the commit number and job id are not available in environment variable. That is the reason that you do not see any graphs yet. Once integrated with travis, all this information will be populated, allowing for a more useful graph.\n",

Since it is becoming a common practice to use punctuation (mostly dots and colons) it would be nice to support any other than word characters in event names. Currently we are matching any word character (this group will act as an event) and separate it by a space character followed by any other character (to create a selector group). I propose to change the first matcher to any non space character since whitespace is used as a separator and thus it won't affect current behaviour but will add support for all other possible characters.\n\nIssue found on stack overflow:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20598754/jquery-widget-on-method-and-rails-ajax-callbacks\n",

IMO this was a bad decision as it harms usability (mostly touch and high DPI input devices).\n> \n> My fix for [#5518](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5518) did take care of inconsistent double and drag-clicks, making the coordinates checking code obsolete.\n> \n> Then, I've tried to push the [PR 945](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/945) to remove all that obsolete code, but it has been stagnated ever since.\n\nThis PR is less audacious than my previous one in that instead of re-creating the whole clicking functionality, it simply removes obsolete  code leaving the drag/click handling to the browser's default behavior.\n\nPasses all current tests.

It certainly doesn't cover everything, so for now won't replace manual reviews. But not having to deal with a bunch of those issues will be pretty nice already.\n\nFixing issues in a file that has dozens issues or more is pretty annoying. For that and for more extensive checks, [esformatter](https://github.com/millermedeiros/esformatter/pull/46) is still pretty promising.\n\nThat's also why I skip datepicker and a few of the interactions and all tests. There's too much garbage that I don't want to fix manually.\n\nFor this PR, someone please take a look at the first commit and see if any of the changes are invalid. We don't want the tool to enforce anything that is against the style guide. I changed lines that still have other issues that the tool doesn't cover, please ignore those.\n",

The conditions never matched, so the documents scroll amount was never subtracted from the datepicker's position.\n\nThis fix uses code adapted from the _findPos function to find the nearest visible element and uses that to test the offset.

There are a few effects which use if ( !show ) instead of if ( hide ) to determine if .hide() should be called, but those can probably all be normalized since this would only affect people explicitly passing a mode of effect when they really mean hide, which probably isn't happening.

I ended up figuring multiplying by 2 magically fixed those elements, no matter the size of the element. I don't know why and that scares me.\n\nI also made test helpers use `position` rather than `offset` so fixed position would work.\nScrolling tests when using `clone` were broken because they used multiple moves, didn't `setScroll` properly.

Apparently, it addressed [3647](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3647). Although, this specific change seemed only to be a handy (yet unfortunate) way to avoid repeating code.\n\nThe two lines ran by the trigger (in the previous days and still today) are [1] and [2] below. The 1 has no effect, since such element has no \".ui-state-hover\" class on creation anyway. The 2 adds \".ui-state-hover\" to the target selector. But it gets removed later.\n\n1: $(this).parents(\".ui-datepicker-calendar\").find(\"a\").removeClass(\"ui-state-hover\");\n2: $(this).addClass(\"ui-state-hover\");\n\nUnless I'm also missing something, we could safely remove the mouseover trigger.\n",

In a spike to see if I could make the code's initialization more understandable, I tried out this refactor and it really feels like a much cleaner initialization process. \n\nTo wit, https://github.com/sgharms/jquery-ui/pull/new/jquery:menubar...refactor#L1R164 shows a _much_ nicer initialization process ( https://github.com/sgharms/jquery-ui/pull/new/jquery:menubar...refactor#L1R221 ) since we have a class that manages all the setup and event application logic.\n\nIt does, however, create a widget called ui.menubarMenuItem.  I feel that the gain in having a class which can be pointed at within the context of ui.menubar is well worth constructing the code in this fashion.\n\nHowever I do not want to create this widget as public, I'd like to keep it as a \"private inner widget\" to menubar.  I'm not sure of the best way to do that.  Conceivably I could delete it from the $ object after assigning it to a private variable inside menubar?  I'm open to better ways of doing it.\n\nIn any case, I believe the code is now _much_ more debuggable and _much_ easier to understand.  This setup will also provide a much better interface for mocking and stubbing in the expanded unit test suite requested by http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar.\n\nThis PR is less \"I want this merged in\" and more of a \"is this way better\" but having looked at this code this morning for a few hours, I despair at ever going back to what's in jquery-ui/menubar.\n",

Have it read the selected value when it changes.\n\nAchieved by: Using an initial aria-labelledby pointing at the button itself and the label. Make the button a live region and change the labelledby when the selection changes. Restore the original labelling on blur to get the correct description the next time the button is focused.\n\nSide notes: Updating aria-selected caused NVDA/Firefox to announce \"not selected\" when changing selection with the open menu. Without it, it instead announces the items as proper menu items (x of n), that's much better.\n\nTODOs: Not sure if removing the menu's labelledby was actually necessary. Though since menu doesn't receive focus, its likely that none of the menu aria changes are necessary. In fact they should probably just be removed.\n\nTested with: VoiceOver/Safari, NVDA/Firefox, JAWS/IE9. The first two are really solid, JAWS is good enough.

The button: core Radio group tests weren't passing on Safari, seems relative to calling `.click()` on a label not triggering the input's change handler in Safari - see [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/7aWLB/). I've replaced the `.click()` calls by `.simulate( \"click\" )` and it passes all unit tests now.\n- Added unit test for dragged click. Works as expected in all modern browsers but seems to fail in old IE, even though the fix does work in old IE as seen in the fiddle below. Not sure whether this needs fixing or a conditional block.\n- As a side effect, the synthetic click also works around [bugzilla ticket #608180](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608180), toggling the checkboxes every time you click the label button, no matter how fast you constantly click.\n#### [_Fiddle preview_](http://jsfiddle.net/KpDsA/15/show/)\n",

I've included appropriate test cases for each issue, as well.\n\nResizable now modifies only the CSS properties that are actually necessary to perform the resize (instead of always setting top, left, width, and height regardless; see [#7605](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7605)). This makes the plugin behave more predictably in dynamic layouts.\n\nFurthermore, the plugin's resize event is now altogether more useful:\n- The event is triggered only when the element's size is modified (as opposed to every mousemove; see [#5545](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5545))\n- The ui callback parameter now correctly reports the element's current size (see [#5817](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5817))\n",

This should facilitate introduction of support for multiple optional segments (if such support is ever desired) without jeopardizing backwards compatibility.\n\nNote that this change does _not_ remove support for un-delineated placeholders; support can be removed once all existing uses of Mask have been updated.\n\nThese changes are documented here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137996/Mask\n",

This makes the plugin behave more predictably in dynamic layouts.\n\nFurthermore, the plugin's resize event is now altogether more useful:\n- The event is triggered only when the element's size is modified (as opposed to every mousemove; see [#5545](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5545))\n- The ui callback parameter now correctly reports the element's current size (see [#5817](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5817))\n",

There may be some rough edges with some of the tests, but I think it's good enough to at least include in the code tree for evaluating certain animation changes.  As browser support for certain CSS3 properties gets better, we can use this to figure out if the jQueryUI+browser combo works out.\n\n(Sorry, this has been sitting on my lappy for a while, and I wanted to make sure I didn't forget to submit a pull request for this.)\n",

Tab 2 has a focusable element in it.\n- Tabs cannot be collapsed using the keyboard. I wasn't sure about this. On one hand, there's no reason to limit functionality for keyboard users. On the other hand, this could result in users accidentally collapsing content if they press space/enter just after the delay.\n\nQuestions:\n- Should users be able to collapse panels using the keyboard?\n- How do users navigate to panels if there's no focusable content?\n- How long should the delay be for the delayed activation?\n- Do any AT devices announce interaction cues that contradict this implementation?\n- Is anything missing/broken?\n",

    "body": "Replacing #652\n\nStarting this pull request to coordinate work between Everett, Hans, Scott and me (could also close this and put it on the wiki, though we should have more code soon). I've just spend a good amount of time reviewing the yahoo.com autocomplete, which is actually pretty similar to our approach. We  figured that announcing only \"autocomplete popup\" is not useful. To make the announcements useful, it should be close to what yahoo.com is doing: \"No search results available\" or \"x search results available, use up and down cursors to navigate\". They don't set aria-activedescendent, so navigation gets announced properly as the input's value changes.\n\nHere's a suggestion what the message format could look like:\n\n``` js\nvar defaults = {\n    messages: {\n        noresults: \"No search results\",\n        xresults: \"$1 results available\"\n        xresults: function(amount) {\n            return amount + \" result\" + (amount > 1 ? \"s\" : \"\") + \" available, use up/down cursor...\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvar de = {\n    messages: {\n        noresults: \"Nichts gefunden\",\n        xresults: function(amount) {\n            return amount + \" Ergebnisse...\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nxresults.replace(\"$1\", amount)\n```\n\nIf its a string, interpolate, if its a function, call it with all variables. That way we can allow simple interpolation where that's enough, and make it flexible enough to deal with more complex cases. Once Globalize adds support for this (https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/100), we can rip out the little custom code we'd require here and use Globalize instead.\n\nThe other change we should make is to extend menu to allow control over aria attributes. For autocomplete, we don't actually want any of them (see the yahoo.com example), just an unordered list. For Selectmenu, we want listbox and role option on the items.\n\nThis would make the autocomplete work in the current generation of screenreaders, following the more pragmatic approach that yahoo.com did on their homepage (not in YUI though). At the same time, we should get screenreader implementations to do more with the aria attributes for that. Currently aria-autocomplete and aria-owns are pretty much completely ignored. If that changes, we could get rid of the live region hack.\n",

    "body": "Starting this pull request to coordinate work between Everett, Hans, Scott and me (could also close this and put it on the wiki, though we should have more code soon). I've just spend a good amount of time reviewing the yahoo.com autocomplete, which is actually pretty similar to our approach. We  figured that announcing only \"autocomplete popup\" is not useful. To make the announcements useful, it should be close to what yahoo.com is doing: \"No search results available\" or \"x search results available, use up and down cursors to navigate\". They don't set aria-activedescendent, so navigation gets announced properly as the input's value changes.\n\nHere's a suggestion what the message format could look like:\n\n``` js\nvar defaults = {\n    messages: {\n        noresults: \"No search results\",\n        xresults: \"$1 results available\"\n        xresults: function(amount) {\n            return amount + \" result\" + (amount > 1 ? \"s\" : \"\") + \" available, use up/down cursor...\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvar de = {\n    messages: {\n        noresults: \"Nichts gefunden\",\n        xresults: function(amount) {\n            return amount + \" Ergebnisse...\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nxresults.replace(\"$1\", amount)\n```\n\nIf its a string, interpolate, if its a function, call it with all variables. That way we can allow simple interpolation where that's enough, and make it flexible enough to deal with more complex cases. Once Globalize adds support for this (https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/100), we can rip out the little custom code we'd require here and use Globalize instead.\n\nThe other change we should make is to extend menu to allow control over aria attributes. For autocomplete, we don't actually want any of them (see the yahoo.com example), just an unordered list. For Selectmenu, we want listbox and role option on the items.\n\nThis would make the autocomplete work in the current generation of screenreaders, following the more pragmatic approach that yahoo.com did on their homepage (not in YUI though). At the same time, we should get screenreader implementations to do more with the aria attributes for that. Currently aria-autocomplete and aria-owns are pretty much completely ignored. If that changes, we could get rid of the live region hack.\n",

Initially I was going to fix this, but since I haven't seen any (recommendations for) accordions that follow this approach, I decided not to in the end. The added Ctrl + Up Arrow shortcut should provide a sufficient alternative for quick navigation. However, I can still add this behavior if you want.

I have no idea which one of those is actually correct to use here, or if we need the blur/focus calls when changing the attributes.\n\nFirst ARIA TODO:\n\n```\n// TODO assert that the blur and focus triggers are really necessary, remove otherwise\ntoHide.prev()\n    .attr({\n        \"aria-expanded\": \"false\",\n        \"aria-selected\": \"false\",\n        tabIndex: -1\n    })\n    .blur();\ntoShow.prev()\n    .attr({\n        \"aria-expanded\": \"true\",\n        \"aria-selected\": \"true\",\n        tabIndex: 0\n    })\n    .focus();\n```\n\nSecond ARIA TODO:\n\n```\nthis.headers\n    .not( this.active )\n    .attr({\n        // TODO: document support for each of these\n        \"aria-expanded\": \"false\",\n        \"aria-selected\": \"false\",\n        tabIndex: -1\n    })\n    .next()\n        .hide();\n```\n\nAlso unaddressed is the one about the ui-accordion-disabled class. I have no idea why that exists. There's also ui-dialog-disabled, ui-slider-disabled and a few interactions-specific ones. We don't style them, so the only use might be for custom disabled styling when the disabled element is the root (the one getting ui-state-disabled), which is sometimes the case, but not for accordion.\n",

Most browsers don't support fractional pixels, and even browsers that do support fractions can't handle the level of precision that we get during an animation. This causes the combined height of the panel being shown and the panel being hidden to jump around a bit during the animation. We try to deal with that by recalculating the total height at each step of the animation and adjusting the height of the panel being shown to account for any pixels that were lost or gained by the browser not being able to handle the exact values that were calculated by `.animate()`.\n\nThis works great in Chrome and Opera. It's ok in IE and not so great in Firefox. However, this is better than what we have now in all browsers.\n\nThis code should not e committed as is. `$.fx.step._height` and the data key should probably be prefixed for accordion, there are var statements in the middle of functions, etc. This pull is just to keep notes around and hopefully provide a good starting point for a final solution.\n",

In theory this should never occur, since you should load your plugins in the correct order. However, in practice this will become more and more likely to occur as our inheritance chains become deeper and users continue to load the official files together, either from a custom download or a CDN.\n\nThe use case that brought this to my attention was creating an extension for the new interaction plugin. If an extension were written for interaction, it'd be likely that users would load files in this order:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"http://some.cdn/jquery-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"http://local.com/interaction-extension.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe changes in jquery.ui.widget.js are pretty heavily commented, so if you're interested in the way that this is accomplished, just read the source. It's probably the closest thing to magic that we have in jQuery UI :-)\n\nThis required me to change `_super()` and `_superApply()` to accept the name of the method again. This change was needed in order to track what level of the prototype chain we're in at any given time. I actually prefer this implementation for `_super()` because it doen't require wrapping all of the methods on the prototype and it just seems a whole lot cleaner.\n",

If jcade is included before a widget, the widget will automatically be instantiated on every element that has the class path in the className attribute. For example, the HTML author would only have to write:\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;jQuery.ui.button&quot;&gt;hello world&lt;/a&gt;\n\nto make the anchor a jQuery UI button. The author would not have to track insertions and call $(selector).button() on each. The instantiation is triggered regardless where or when the element is added to the document, or how the element was created (via source, innerHTML assignments, jQuery methods, or methods from other frameworks).\n\nOptions can be passed using \"classname:options\" or \"fullclasspath:options\" attributes on the HTML element. For example, to disable an anchor button, the HTML author can write:\n\n&lt;a class=\"jQuery.ui.button\" button:options=\"disabled:true\"&gt;hello world&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor (fully qualified):\n\n&lt;a class=\"jQuery.ui.button\" jQuery.ui.button:options=\"disabled:true\"&gt;hello world&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSee https://github.com/snesin/jcade for more information.\n\nExisting declarations are unaffected. If jcade was not included by the page author, automatic instantiation does not happen and widgets are attached manually as before. The page author can weigh the pros to cons of using jcade and have the option of automatic binding of widgets.\n",

Returning the modified if statement to the way it looked in v1.8.16.\n\nThe second part, in Core, was necessary for IE8 and older versions of IE. This is because for old IE, parentNode returns a node with nodeType === 11 (DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE) for elements that have no parent.\n\nAt first I wanted to add the nodeType === 11 check to the modified line in Draggable to avoid modifying Core. However, the error persists even if the check was added there.\n\nHere's a test case, with the option of monkey-patching jQuery UI with this commit's modifications: http://jsfiddle.net/maljub01/ahyfr/\n",

The ticket was sparse on details (at first I assumed that it would use an animated gif but recognize that that may have issues and would include a new image to each theme) so I made mine use the animation of moving a small bar back and forth.

I also tried to add little weight and refactoring to the existing code.\n\nIf you resize it mid animation it does have problems, easily fixed, I just want to know if my contribution is even on the right track (or maybe my first assumption with the gif was right).\n\nThanks,\nClark Endrizzi\n",

This PR is just to start a discussion and get feedback.\n\n**This drops support for IE 6 because of fixed positioning.**\n\nThe overlay now uses fixed positioning and is sized to 100%x100%. This removes the need to constantly adjust the size of the overlay and let's us stop hacking around dimension issues in various browsers. This needs to be checked in all browsers to make sure this doesn't cause scrollbars and works as expected.\n\nWe now cancel events based on whether the element is inside a dialog, not what the z-index is. **This almost certainly will break existing functionality, such as autocomplete and datepickers inside dialogs.** We need to find a better solution. If an event occurs on an invalid element, we now shift focus back to the dialog. We need to figure out a way to know which dialog to focus when this happens.\n\nThe overlay no longer handles pressing escape because it should never have focus now (focus should shift back to the dialog).\n\nThere's probably other stuff I haven't thought of yet...\n",

I couldn't find any spec that clarifies why that is, but it does appear to happen consistently. \n\nIMO, it's reasonable to expect end-users to deal with this during explicit DOM manipulation calls ($.html(), $.after(), etc), but not necessarily so during an animation. The fact that jquery.ui animations end up performing DOM manipulations implicitly is not at all obvious to the user and thus the focus-loosing behavior is unexpected and worth avoiding. \n\nThis is probably not a very common use case but $.effects.removeWrapper really is the only place to fix it (there are no callbacks in which to detect the previously focused element) and the overhead doesn't strike me as terribly noticeable considering it only occurs at the end of an animation.\n\nCheers,\n- Ruy\n",

Once the observationInterval option is set to some value greater than 0 such as 100ms, input values will be observed periodically with specified interval. \nI think realtime checking of input value under multibyte transliteration is difficult to be achieved without setInterval(). Google's search box is implemented with that.\nI would appreciate if you give me some feedback. If you don't have an environment to test using IME, I will take a capturing movie or something.\n",

So I use an IsNumber test instead\n2) The corresponding dimension was computed by using csize instead of data\nFinally, I updated _respectSize to use the \"virtual boundaries\" rather than the min/max width/height set in the options (in normal cases, the virtual boundaries will correspond to min/max width/height)\n\nThe resizable unit tests on FF4.0 / Chrome 11 now pass 128 tests out of 137 (it's not failing any unit test related to preserve aspect anymore). The fix is purely algorithmic so that should work on other browsers as well.\n\nIf there is anything wrong in the coding style, please let me know. I'll update\n",

However, I think the most desirable behavior is for the box to move along with its target. This patch adds a listener for `drag` and `resize` events on the `appendTo` target to allow the autocomplete box to recalculate its position and z-index during such events. (There is a timeout of 0 because the target element's new position is only available after the event.)\n\nSeems to work quite well in testing; however, this is my first time working with the jQueryUI source, so please let me know if I've done anything horribly wrong.\n",

The \"reversed ID referencing\" often causes the browser not to properly expose the active descendant as focused element to assistive technology. Because the change had to be performed in two steps (1. remove ID from old element, 2. add ID to new element, plus for this to work the aria-activedescendant attribute itself had to be removed and added again on the menu element) , focus will often briefly be lost and go back to the menu itself (which from a DOM perspective is what had focus all along). You can test this using a screen reader or, more accurately, using an MSAA inspect tool such as Inspect32 to highlight focus. This will cause most screen readers to go haywire, announcing the entire menu, or announcing that focus has moved out of the menubar altogether. \n\nBecause of all this, I've experimented with using aria-activedescendant the way it was intended to:  setting ID values on all menu items and updating the value directly on the activedescendant attribute. This solved most of the issues. The screen reader announcement is much more accurate, and focus is correctly exposed on the right elements. Another advantage is that we can now label all submenus by having their aria-labelledby attribute point to the ID of their parent menu item.  \n\nOne issue I did still notice was that when a nested submenu is expanded using the right arrow key (and focus moves to the expanded submenu), Firefox will detect the aria-activedescendant change before  it notices that the submenu is actually visible. Because the browser thinks that the new menu item is hidden when activedescendant changes, it will just move focus back to the top level menu. The only way I found to fix this is to set a small delay in the .right() method, causing the .focus() method to be called 20 ms later than it normally would. This ensures that Firefox perceives the menu item as visible  and it will make the aria-activedescendant change work. Not ideal to use a timeout for this, so maybe we should talk to Mozilla about why this issue is occurring in the first place.\n",

I added logic to defer the selection from mouse-down to mouse-move when mouse-down happens over the colliding parts of two or more handles. I added logic to choose the \"best\" handle when the handle values overlap and a mouse-click event is interpreted. Previously it was always choosing the first (bottom-most) handle on same-value mouse-click events, which explains the can-only-move-bottom-handle on overlap behavior. These changes should allow smart-selection from an arbitrary number of colliding handles, not just two. All other existing slider behaviors (such as not sliding past your neighbor) stay the same. The fix turned into more than just a few tweaked lines as I needed to store a list of overlapping handles and the original event as well as refer to the slider's orientation to help determine what to do. Works like a charm though! \n\nAs an added  bonus, there is now enough info available to \"swap\" sliders as you move a handle pass a neighbor, so you could \"pass\" a neighbor without reordering the handles themselves, though this is not implemented.\n",

When the dialog was higher than the document height, before the dialog has been shown, the dialog increased the height of the document. And so the height of the modal overlay was too short. \n\nI've added a if statement, which checks whether the dialog is higher than the document and take the higher value.\n\nI've tested it in Google Chrome 9, IE 8, FF 3.6, FF 4.0 Beta, Safari 5.0 and Opera 11.0\n\nRegards Jo\n\nPS: please let me know, if you contented with my work\n",

Thus, this might affect other plugins/applications too and it would probably be better to fix it in jQuery directly. The problem occurs when calling focus() for an input field that already has the focus and after it got changed (e.g. from a keyup event). Whenever a field gets the focus jQuery stores the current content of that field and then later triggers the change event only if the content has changed since it got the focus (only if . So calling focus() explicitly might not be a good idea, at least, not if the focus is already on the field, which is what this patch prevents.

I think that's a fairly common scenario so hopefully you will consider including my change.\n\nI've added two new options - \"showDelay\" and \"hideDelay\" with defaults of 500ms and 250ms respectively. These allow the show/hide of the tooltip to be delayed as required, although either can be set to 0 to show/hide immediately as it worked previously.\n\nThe show delay is really just for eye candy (it works well for me as I don't want lots of tooltip flashing on/off as I rapidly tab through a form) but is added for completeness. The hide delay is essential as it allows time for the mouse to move from the tooltip element to the tooltip overlay div.\n\nI've also added listeners to the tooltip overlay div for focus/mouseenter and blur/mouseleave to cancel the pending show/hide operations. The bulk of the change is within the _init function and should hopefully be reasonably clear - please let me know if you have any queries (aretmanski@smoothcontract.com).\n\nNow, I'm new to much of this so please forgive me if this breaks tests - I haven't added any coverage for this change but if you're willing to include it I'd be happy to provide some (I need to brush up on javascript testing first!). This is also my first pull request so apologies if I've made any newbie errors!\n\nMany thanks,\n\nAndrew Retmanski\nSmooth Contract Limited\n",

To fix this, I made it so clicking again does nothing. Once the rotation is finished clicking is re-enabled.\n\nI'm sure there is probably a better way to do this (make clicking a second time either abort the original transition, or immediately complete the original transition and begin a new transition?) but this is the best I could do with the limited time I have...\n\nhttp://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4771\n",
