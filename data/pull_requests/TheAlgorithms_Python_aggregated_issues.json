If so, we can just close this PR. If not, I think we can let it pass with the caveat that the code must be refactored/rewritten and more thoroughly documented.",

If I've made a mistake here and you truly wrote this code yourself (and it's GeeksforGeeks who plagiarized from you), then please explain your situation to us and convince us with evidence. If you can do that, then I'll gladly remove the label.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I had deferred to @cclauss for the final decision since he's a much more senior maintainer of this repo than I am. @cclauss, since you closed the PR, it'd be nice if you could weigh in on this as well.

I really do not understand why anybody thinks an apology itself can be plagiarized-my objective was to be truly apologetic.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I use some assistance from tools like ChatGPT to help me express myself in English because it's not my native language. In making this apology, I wanted my words and intentions to be mine, but I have used the tool to double-check that the message is as clear and polite as possible. My intention was to honestly express my feelings and acknowledge my mistake.

This can be achieved by breaking down the merge_sort function into smaller, more modular functions with descriptive names that clearly outline each step of the algorithm. Additionally, I suggest adding comments to explain the logic behind key sections of the code, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the algorithm in the future. This enhancement will not only make the code more organized but also facilitate easier debugging and potential future optimizations. I am excited to contribute to this improvement and welcome any feedback or suggestions for further enhancements.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on improving the code quality and maintainability of the merge sort algorithm implementation.

The terms help distinguish between the training and testing phases. In the provided code,` \"test_input\"` is used during prediction, but using `\"train_input\"` for consistency is acceptable as long as it's clear in the code context.

This approach iterates through all possible fractions and counts those meeting the specified criteria.\r\n\r\nAdded an improved solution utilizing the Numba library for optimized performance. This implementation uses a Numba-optimized function solution decorated with @njit to compile the code to machine code, significantly improving execution speed. The algorithm employs a different approach to count fractions between 1/3 and 1/2. It utilizes a loop with numerator and denominator ranges to calculate the count, avoiding unnecessary iterations by counting the fractions directly meeting the criteria while leveraging Numba's JIT compilation for efficiency.\r\n\r\nFixes #8594\r\n\r\n### Describe your change:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* [ ] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Add or change doctests? -- Note: Please avoid changing both code and tests in a single pull request.\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [ ] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [ ] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [ ] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [ ] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

The comparison operation always returns either true or false. Such logical short circuits in code lead to unintended behavior. iCR suggested that the logical operation should be reviewed for correctness.\r\n\r\nThe expression `self.parent.left is self.parent.left is self` is not clear in its intent. The chaining of is operators can make it hard to understand what exactly is being checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n## CLA Requirements\r\n*This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions.*\r\n\r\nAll contributed commits are already automatically signed off.\r\n\r\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\r\n\\- [Git Commit SignOff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sponsorship and Support\r\nThis work is done by the security researchers from OpenRefactory and is supported by the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/): [Project Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/).

When a number is odd we multiply it by 3 and subtract 1. Any odd number multiplied by 3 is odd and an odd number -1 is always even. therefore we can execute the division of two step right after logging the first odd sequence which will speed up the performance of the algorithm by bypassing the execution of lines 51-53 every time a number is first reached.     \r\n       \r\nFor more information to understand the definition of odd numbers I am using in this scenario please refer to the following website. https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/odd-numbers/\r\n\r\n\r\n* [ ] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Add or change doctests? -- Note: Please avoid changing both code and tests in a single pull request.\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [x] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [x] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

It is implementation of finding **Maximum Bipartite Matching**.This involves finding the largest possible matching in a bipartite graph. A bipartite graph is one whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.\r\n\r\nIt has multiple application to list few \r\n\r\n1. Online Dating Platforms: Algorithms use bipartite graphs to match users based on shared interests, aiming to pair individuals who have expressed mutual interest in each other.\r\n2.

The current pull request contains tons of files which makes it difficult to review but there is great stuff here. Rectangles need four Sides, not two. Using dataclasses makes building doctests easier.\r\n\r\n@cclauss , Thank you incredibly for the thorough code review, it is grately appreciated! I have a few clarifying questions, just to check whether I understood everything correctly, if you don't mind, to not waste more of your time in the future:\r\n\r\n1. Should we keep all of the code in one file, just as the code review showed, or was the code placed in one file simply for a more efficient code review, and the original structure is fine?\r\n\r\n2. Do you think it would be a good idea to move all of the primitives (Angle, Side) to a file (f.e. 'primities.py'), and Shapes into a different file (f.e. 'shapes.py'), as a more structured approach (leave files such as open_shape, closed_shape, e.t.c.)?\r\n\r\n3. Based on 'The Algorithms' structure, and the mission of the repo, would it be better to leave the structure as it is right now, complicated yet easy to add onto in the future (f.e. adding a new class to the structure), if anyone wishes, or to simplify it by modifying the existing code directly (f.e. adding a new method to an existing class), yet making it harder to add onto in the future?",

Put something better instead.",
      "Thanks for doing this.  Sorry that it took so long to land.\r\n\r\nIn a future pull request(s) could be broken into the following files.\r\n* `angle.py`\r\n* `side.py`\r\n* `ellipse.py` includes Ellipse and Circle (Perhaps `Oval` should be the base class ;-) )\r\n* `polygon.py` includes Rectangle, Square, (future...)

    "body": "###hacktoberfest\r\n\r\n### **Description**\r\nThis pull request extends the functionality of the FuzzySet class by introducing set-like operations (&, |, ~) and adding corresponding doctests. These enhancements make the FuzzySet class even more versatile for working with fuzzy sets in the context of fuzzy logic.\r\n\r\n### **Changes Made:**\r\n- Added the '&' (intersection), '|' (union), and '~' (complement) operations to the FuzzySet class, enabling set-like operations for fuzzy sets.\r\n- Implemented corresponding doctests for the new operations, ensuring their correctness and reliability.\r\n\r\n### **Purpose:**\r\nThe purpose of these changes is to enhance the FuzzySet class's capabilities and make it more powerful for fuzzy logic and control systems. The introduction of set operations is a valuable addition for those working with fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic.\r\n\r\n### **Testing:**\r\nThe new code changes come with extensive doctests that verify the correctness of the '&' (intersection), '|' (union), and '~' (complement) operations. These tests cover various scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability.\r\n\r\nI invite your review and feedback on these changes. Feel free to suggest any improvements or modifications to make the FuzzySet class even better. Your input is highly valued, and I aim to contribute to a more comprehensive and effective tool for fuzzy logic operations.\r\n\r\n @cclauss \r\n",

This class implements the BF-cipher algorithm and provides useful methods for interpreting instructions.

While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.\r\n\r\nThe language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding, as it was not meant or made for designing actual software but to challenge the boundaries of computer programming.

The code now looks like this:\r\n\r\n `cross_strip = []\r\n   mid_x = points_sorted_on_x[mid][0]  # x-coordinate of the middle point\r\n   for point in points_sorted_on_x:\r\n       if abs(point[0] - mid_x) < closest_pair_dis:\r\n           cross_strip.append(point)`",

    "body": "**###hacktoberfest**\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nThis pull request introduces the FuzzySet class, designed to represent and manipulate triangular fuzzy sets widely used in fuzzy logic and control systems. The creation of this class was motivated by the need for a versatile tool for fuzzy logic operations.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n- **FuzzySet Class**: The FuzzySet class is defined with attributes such as name, a (left boundary), b (peak), and c (right boundary) to describe the fuzzy set. It also provides methods for membership calculation, union, intersection, and complement operations.\r\n\r\n### Functionality:\r\n- **Membership Calculation**: The membership method calculates the membership value of an input x in the fuzzy set, handling cases where x is outside the fuzzy set boundaries.\r\n\r\n- **Union and Intersection**: The union and intersection methods allow users to calculate the union and intersection of fuzzy sets, respectively. These operations create new fuzzy sets based on the input fuzzy sets.\r\n\r\n- **Complement (Negation)**: The complement method computes the complement (negation) of the fuzzy set, making it a valuable addition for fuzzy logic operations.\r\n\r\n- **Plotting**: The plot method generates a visual representation of the membership function for effective visualization and analysis.\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\nI have added a comprehensive test suite for the FuzzySet class to ensure its correctness and robustness. The tests cover various scenarios, including both valid and erroneous input values.\r\n\r\n### Example Usage:\r\nThe example usage section demonstrates how to create FuzzySet instances, perform operations, and visualize the membership functions of fuzzy sets. It provides practical insights into the class's capabilities.\r\n\r\nI welcome your review and feedback, and I'm open to further improvements. Transparency is important, and I have designed this class based on existing knowledge and references from reputable sources.\r\n",

Create Doctest Instructions: Python \"doctest\" can be executed by running the following command: python -m doctest -v equilibrium_index.py.\r\n\r\n2. Deleted Argument {size}: Deleted the `size` argument because `len(arr)} allows the array's length to be determined inside the function, simplifying and improving the readability of the function signature.\r\n\r\n3. Used {enumerate}: To improve code readability and indicate that we're working with element-index pairs, we iterated through the array using both elements and their indices using the `enumerate` function.\r\n\r\n4. Optimized the Loop: To prevent pointless additions, the loop was improved by initializing {left_sum} with the value of the first element (arr[0]). Furthermore, since the beginning and last items (0 and size - 1) cannot be equilibrium indices, there is no need to check them, saving further computations.\r\n\r\n### Describe your change:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* [ ] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [x] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Add or change doctests? -- Note: Please avoid changing both code and tests in a single pull request.\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [ ] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [ ] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [ ] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

Type Hints: Type hints have been added to the function signature to enhance code readability and type safety.\r\n\r\n2. Tuple Unpacking: We have replaced the (a, b) = (b, a) syntax for swapping elements with the more Pythonic a, b = b, a approach.\r\n\r\n3. Descriptive Variable Names: Variable names have been made more descriptive. For example, least has been renamed to min_index for better clarity.\r\n\r\n4. Removed Unnecessary Comments: Unnecessary comments that didn't provide additional value have been removed. Well-named variables and docstrings make the code self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [] This pull request is all my own work; I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

      "> Here is a potential issue with the line if not min_block: Since min_block is a sublist of the original list blocks, modifying it inside the loop with min_block.pop(0) will also change the original block list. Therefore, it's only safe to check if min_block: directly.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the minimum element, the **if not min_block:** condition checks if the current block is empty. If it is open, the block is removed from the list of blocks. This is a valid and necessary step in the Block Sort algorithm to ensure all elements are merged correctly.\r\n\r\nThe code correctly implements the Block Sort algorithm, which divides the input list into blocks of size, sqrt(n), sorting each block and merging the blocks into a single sorted list. In that case, the code handles empty input lists and returns an empty list. It also includes documents to verify the correctness of the implementation."

This addition includes a complete implementation of the RC4 algorithm in Python, along with detailed comments and examples to explain its usage.\r\n\r\nThis contribution aims to enhance the collection of algorithms in the Python repository by providing a commonly used cryptographic algorithm, RC4. RC4 has a wide range of applications, and this implementation follows Python naming conventions, includes type hints, and passes doctests for automated testing.\r\n\r\nI have carefully followed the contributing guidelines to ensure that the code adheres to the repository's standards and practices. The implementation includes key features such as key scheduling, keystream generation, encryption, and decryption.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is well-documented and widely recognized in the field of cryptography. To ensure clarity and ease of understanding, this contribution includes extensive comments and example comments in the code. These comments provide insights into the algorithm's workings and illustrate how to use it effectively. Users can refer to the provided comments and examples to integrate RC4 into their cryptographic applications.\r\n\r\nI am excited to collaborate andI look forward to feedback and further improvements.\r\n\r\n* [x] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Add or change doctests? -- Note: Please avoid changing both code and tests in a single pull request.\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [x] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [x] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

      "@ManpreetSingh2004 a good solution with filtering by prime numbers. Look at 072, I made it, you can probably apply it there too.",
      "Hi @quant12345,\r\nThank you for your suggestion! Your input is much appreciated!\r\nI noticed that the prime filtering for 072 is already implemented in sol2.py. Although it is as fast as sol1 with both taking 1 sec. What should be done in this case?\r\nAlso, I've identified a bug in 'sol1.py' that appears to be related to integer overflow. This issue specifically arises on Windows platforms because, by default, numpy on `Windows 64-bit` uses 32-bit integers, whereas on Linux, it employs 64-bit integers, so it also went unnoticed in automated checking of this repo. See #10672. I already have 3 PRs open so bot closes new ones.",

Since `pytest-cov` is just a plugin for `pytest`, running the latter requires running the former, and I believe that must include the progress bar and warnings. Plus, this would require us to basically run `pytest` twice per build. Perhaps we could output the coverage report to a temporary file, but that's not ideal. I don't have any better solution at this time.",

This code uses a class-based approach to model jobs, where each job has a name, priority, burst time, and a sequentially assigned job number. The priority round robin scheduling algorithm is applied to execute the jobs.\r\n\r\nChanges Made:\r\n- Added a `Job` class with attributes for name, priority, burst time, and a sequentially assigned job number.\r\n- Implemented a `priority_rr_scheduling` function to perform priority round robin scheduling.\r\n- The code takes user input for the total number of jobs, job names, priorities, burst times, and the time quantum.\r\n- Automatically assigns job numbers to each job in sequential order.\r\n- Prints the order in which jobs are completed and the time at which each job completes its execution.\r\n\r\nFile Name: priority_rr_scheduler.py\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* [x] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [x] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [x] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

      "@tianyizheng02 Sir, I added the general swish model in the Sigmoid Linear Unit Model and renamed it as 'swish.py'. Now in order to maintain learning through these algorithms, I didn't find it appealing enough to delete the existing SiLU function to let others know that it is a popular name for the swish function of parameter 1. Hence I just added both functions. Could you please look into this and merge my PR?\r\n",

It has an input layer, a hidden layer with a tanh activation, and an output layer.\r\n\r\nThe init() method initializes the weight matrices and bias vectors randomly.\r\n\r\nThe forward() method performs the feedforward pass, calculating the outputs from the input data using the weights/biases.\r\n\r\nThe fit() method trains the network using backpropagation and gradient descent. It:\r\n\r\nMakes predictions\r\nCalculates the loss\r\nComputes gradients of the loss with respect to the weights/biases\r\nUpdates the weights/biases to reduce the loss\r\nThis allows the MLP to learn non-linear functions approximators and fit to training data for tasks like classification. The network is trained iteratively using backprop and gradient descent to minimize the loss.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the MLP class implements a basic neural network that can be trained on data to perform machine learning tasks by learning to make data-driven predictions and decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n* [ ] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [x] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [x] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [x] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

    "body": "The provided Python script offers a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a renowned combinatorial optimization challenge. The approach employed in this code is a straightforward brute-force method that exhaustively explores all possible permutations of a given set of points to identify the optimal path. To begin, the script imports the permutations function from the itertools library, which plays a pivotal role in generating every conceivable permutation of the input points. A calculate_total_distance function computes the overall distance for a given order of points by employing the Euclidean distance formula. The heart of the code, the tsp_bruteforce function, iterates through these permutations, calculating their distances and maintaining records of the best path and its total distance. The main function functions as the program's entry point, soliciting user input to determine the number of points and their coordinates. Upon receiving user input, the script engages the TSP solver to identify the most efficient path and compute its total distance. If executed directly, rather than being imported as a module, the script initiates the TSP solving process.\r\n\r\n### Describe your change:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* [x] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [ ] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [ ] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

    "body": "\r\n### Describe your change:\r\nThe Bernoulli principle is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that describes the relationship between the pressure and velocity of a fluid in a streamlined flow. You can use Python to create a simple script to visualize the Bernoulli principle. In this example, I have use the Matplotlib library to create a plot that demonstrates the principle.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm:-\r\n\r\n1. import `numpy` as np and import `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: These lines import the NumPy library as \"np\" and the Matplotlib library as \"plt.\" NumPy is used for numerical calculations, and Matplotlib is used for creating plots and visualizations.\r\n\r\n2. `v = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)`: This line creates an array v of 100 equally spaced values between 0 and 10. This array represents a range of velocities.\r\n\r\n3. `pressure_constant = 1.0`: This line sets a constant value for the Bernoulli equation. In this example, it's set to 1.0 for simplicity, but in real-world applications, this constant would be specific to the fluid and conditions being analyzed.\r\n\r\n4. `pressure = pressure_constant - 0.5 * v**2`: This line calculates the pressure using the Bernoulli equation. It relates the pressure and velocity of a fluid in a streamlined flow. The result is stored in the pressure array.\r\n\r\n5. `plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))`: This line creates a new figure for the plot with a specified size (8 units wide and 6 units high).\r\n\r\n6. `plt.plot(v, pressure)`: This line plots the data. It uses the array v as the x-axis (velocity) and the array pressure as the y-axis (pressure).\r\n\r\n7. `plt.title(\"Bernoulli Principle Visualization\")`: This line sets the title of the plot.\r\n\r\n8. `plt.xlabel(\"Velocity\") and plt.ylabel(\"Pressure\")`: These lines set labels for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.\r\n\r\n9. `plt.grid(True)`: This line adds a grid to the plot for better readability.\r\n\r\n10. `plt.show()`: Finally, this line displays the plot.

      "Finally my all tests have passes",
      "I feel uncomfortable with this... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate describes the churn rate as a percentage over a given period such as 25% per year.  This calculation is truncating the output for unspecified reasons and also does not deliver a percentage over a given period.  The datafile is 10k lines which is quite substantial compared to other algorithms while the code delivers an output that is a bit baffling.\r\n\r\n@tianyizheng02 @ChrisO345 Are you seeing something that I am not?",
      "Well for me, churn rate is the turnover rate of the customer from a company. This is a sample dataset I acquired from IBM skillset. Initially my program was simple with much more info. But due to various failing test(ruff, build) I had to modify quite a lot of thing, remove quite a lot of things to make it compatible. If this repo accepted jupyter notebooks, I could have shown in much more great detail. And the main purpose of the program is to show how decision tree classifier predicts.",
      "Well, my first first pull request is yet to be accepted. Let's see how it goes. Be sure to let me know what changes should I make.",
      "Please submit the original on https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Jupyter and @mention me on that submission so perhaps we can land it there.  They have much easier requirements."

This existing implementation cites the exact same GeeksForGeeks article as you do. Furthermore, your implementation is failing all our checks and relies on printing (see our contributing guidelines: algorithmic code should not print, and your code should be encapsulated in functions anyway)."

Ugly Numbers are positive integers whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. They are widely used in dynamic programming and optimization problems.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm follows a dynamic programming approach and calculates the nth Ugly Number efficiently by generating Ugly Numbers in ascending order. The implementation includes type hints, doctests, and proper documentation following Python naming conventions.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n- Dynamic Programming and Ugly Numbers: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ugly-numbers/\r\n",
