    "body": "Currently, whenever someone is trying to run Geyser on a system where the `so_reuseport` socket option should exist (which we guess based on the kernel version), we assume that it's fine to set the option.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are still cases where that's not a good indicator. In such cases, users get a warning in the console & Geyser fails to bind fully:\r\n```11:51:56 [WARNING] Unknown channel option 'io.netty.channel.unix.UnixChannelOption#SO_REUSEPORT' for channel 'org.cloudburstmc.netty.channel.raknet.RakServerChannel@38f35f8d'```\r\n\r\nThis should alleviate the issue by double-checking whether the option exists once we have a bootstrap where we can get a channel from - however, i'm no netty expert and there might be other consequences I'm missing, so some testing from affected users would be great :p\r\n\r\nThis also moves the Transport check to Geyser, since we need to be able to ensure that if IO_Uring isn't enabled on Geysers side, that we fall back to e.g. epoll instead of nio.

The block is not registered in said registry, and thus it returns `null`.",
      "Nice catch! I wonder if there's some specific way for us to retrieve the - modded/base block. However, that may hit the limits of our Java protocol library or be better handled by hydraulic :p\n\nBtw, did you test how much the break speed deviates? It's probably not an ideal scenario here, but maybe the best workaround given the circumstances ",
      "I did indeed test the breaking speed of custom blocks, and it seems to work fine on Bedrock. I am not entirely sure how Polymer handles custom breaking speeds, but it seems to send a packet to let the client think it has mining fatigue, then calculate block breaking progress server side and send this to the client, which seems to work just as fine on Bedrock as it does on Java. The only thing I noticed is that while on Java the mining fatigue icon is hidden, on Bedrock it is visible, but this doesn't cause any issues nor do I think it is really fixable.\r\n\r\nRelevant code can be seen [here](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer/blob/dev/1.20.3/polymer-core/src/main/java/eu/pb4/polymer/core/mixin/block/ServerPlayerInteractionManagerMixin.java)",

The client will also include a boolean immediately after the 4 byte cookie set to false to indicate that it does not support RakNet encryption.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of this change has also been updated on the RakNet page of wiki.vg (https://wiki.vg/Raknet_Protocol) to include these optional fields and specify their usage.\r\n\r\nWe have already given the major DDoS mitigation providers mentioned on our wiki (TCPShield, Infinity Filter, CosmicGuard, NeoProtect, and Pufferfish) advanced notice regarding this change, so no action should be needed for users of these services by the time this is merged.\r\n\r\nAttached are packet dumps showing the initial connection with and without this change. These can be viewed in Wireshark:\r\n[cookie_pcaps.zip](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/files/14899289/cookie_pcaps.zip)",

      "@MossCG just wanted to clarify in your wireshark screenshot that we are not actually encrypting the RakNet connection with this PR (the connection after login during game play is already encrypted, not using RakNet's builtin encryption scheme). There was an issue in wireshark where it would incorrectly think that the RakNet connection was encrypted based on the first packet requesting security, but this is disabled in the next packet since the Bedrock client does not support full encryption. I had to PR to wireshark to fix this, which was merged: https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/merge_requests/15123. Not sure when it will make it to release. (Just in case you do end up making a post and used that).",

      "The latest version I am currently using still has this issue. Geyser sends a large number of data packets to a player's IP, causing the VPS's upstream bandwidth to run to full capacity, resulting in delayed disconnection for all players. After a while, it will automatically disappear. This situation can occur dozens of times a day. Perhaps the cookie verification fixed and added by Geyser did not work?\r\n\r\n目前我用的最新版仍有这个问题，geyser会向某个玩家的IP发送大量数据包，以至于使VPS的上行带宽跑满，玩家全部延迟掉线，过会又会自动消失，这个情况一天可以出现几十次，也许是geyser修复并添加了的cookie验证没起作用?",

This can be specified as either part of the array, or as a string value as `DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_SINGLE_VALUE_AS_ARRAY` is also enabled by this PR, which will assume list types given as a string in the config are length one lists. For example, TCPShield and Cosmic provide a URL with an updated list of their CIDRs:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nbedrock:\r\n# ...\r\n  proxy-protocol-whitelisted-ips: [ \"https://cosmic.global/ips/\", \"https://tcpshield.com/v4/\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe version of netty-transport-raknet is bumped to the latest version (`1.0.0.CR1-20240330.103819-16`).\r\n\r\n## Associated PRs\r\n\r\nThese changes are documented in a PR to the wiki at: https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserWiki/pull/257.",

In which we so far didn't include custom items, as the Java client too didn't (and still doesn't) include them. Unfortunately, this leads to crafting recipes that output these custom items not being shown in the recipe book.\r\nHence - let's allow including them! \r\nIncluding custom items that are based on e.g. CustomModelData in the creative inventory won't mean that it's possible to get the item through it - you can click on it, and it'll disappear. Therefore, we ideally wouldn't include these items there at all, but well, that causes them to not show up in the recipe book. Shucks.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows defining the creative category (and optionally, the group) where the custom item would be shown - just adding all custom items seemed like a risk since some people add a lot of them.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Allows custom items (not just nonvanilla items) to be added to the creative inventory. \r\n- Moved `creativeGroup` and `creativeCategory` from `NonVanillaCustomItemData` to `CustomItemData`, and allowed specifying these in the mapping system\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"format_version\": 1,\r\n  \"items\": {\r\n    \"minecraft:stone_sword\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"my_sword\",\r\n        \"custom_model_data\": 2,\r\n        \"icon\": \"apple\",\r\n        \"creativeCategory\": \"1\",\r\n        \"creativeGroup\": \"\" // Does not need to be specified at all - would default to empty\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow crafting recipes that output the custom item - here, `my_sword` to be shown in the Bedrock recipe book:\r\n![image](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/assets/105284508/af891275-baaf-464d-83bc-e83e3d09b1b4)\r\n\r\nBonus-change:\r\n- Custom Armor should now be enchantable and semi-working with anvils\r\n\r\nA list of all creative group items can be found here: https://wiki.bedrock.dev/documentation/creative-categories.html#list-of-categories\r\nThe `creativeCategory` field can be 1,2,3 or 4. 5 and 6 also seem to work, but don't actually register the items :/\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/4279",

At the very least we don't have to re-open lecterns now. Actually, you do need to if you're not on 1.20.60 - below that version, clients are a bit... stubborn on opening lecterns.

Heck, sending an \"pls close lectern\" packet is also ignored! The only thing that works is sending an empty lectern, that kicks them out of the book menu.\r\n- Old lectern workarounds weren't removed, and will still be needed to some extent even after 1.20.60+ is supported. Bedrock clients won't try to open a lectern if no book is on them :(\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/4426 , adds more debugging (and a potential fix; see `BedrockInteractTranslator`) for https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/4141 - that apparently can occur when a client decides to open a chest, quickly closes it, and opens the player inventory instead; leading to some fun deadlock.

    "body": "Hey! This PR aims to resolve a few issues related to `/geyser reload` and general hacky inconsistencies on all bootstraps.\r\n\r\n**Bootstrap changes:**\r\nTo achieve this, this PR would split the current `onEnable` and `onDisable` methods set by the `GeyserBootstrap` interface into separate methods to avoid some of the reload guards.\r\n\r\nInstead of  `onEnable`, there now would be a `onGeyserInitialize` and `onGeyserEnable` method. Similarly, there would be a `onGeyserDisable` / `onGeyserShutdown` method. The prefix should avoid conlicts with platform methods (such as spigots onLoad, or fabric onInitialize), and allow us to properly define loading behavior.\r\n\r\n`onGeyserInitialize` would be called early, and only once (with spigot's reloading being the exception, but that's a different mess). This would primarily do things that would only need to be done once, for example registering event listeners, checking for platform incompatibilities, or similar things that would only be done once instead of multiple times.\r\n\r\n`onGeyserLoad` would be called once when it's time to \"start\" Geyser. For e.g. spigot, that would be after all other plugins load, for Velocity, that would be called when the ListenerBoundEvent, and so forth. This method would also be called again for the Geyser reload command to basically re-start Geyser. Additionally, Bungee and Spigot platforms would now also load the config in onGeyserEnable, which will also re-load the config with the `geyser reload` command. (resolves https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/4299).\r\n\r\n`onGeyserDisable` would be called exclusively for the geyser reload command, or indirectly by `onGeyserShutdown`. This would also ensure that we e.g. dont shut down the Geyser injector - if configured/present - since that wouldn't be re-created with a reload.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Internal changes**\r\n\r\nThe bootstrap changes here require a few other internal adjustments too. For example, the command's in the command manager are no longer cleared with a disable - since we're not able to re-register commands.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, i've added a GeyserPreReloadEvent and GeyserPostReloadEvent to be called before and after Geyser reloads. You can think of these as being equivalents to the `GeyserPreInitialize` and `GeyserPostInitialize` events. In an ideal world, we would be able to shut down extensions fully and load them new in the reload event. This is unfortunately not possible - seeing that e.g. commands cannot be added or removed while the server is running. Hence, a better solution than to disable extensions is to keep them running, and indicate that we are reloading using these new events.\r\n\r\nAnother major change would be that we would start Geyser immediately on the spigot/paper variant with onEnable instead of waiting for other plugins - otherwise, we can't register extension commands properly.\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n- Yeeted old velocity check, replaced with a check for outdated velocity using it's api methods\r\n- moved bungee query disabling to after the config was loaded - since changing the bedrock port (geyser's listening port) is possible with reload, we might need to re-do that\r\n- removed pre4.0.0 viaversion check - there is still a check for outdated viaversion\r\n\r\n**Possibilities/Goals:**\r\n- This should make the ViaProxy implementation less hacky, since it can now split it's logic properly\r\n- Changing/Expanding `geyser reload` behavior: With this PR, it would leave extensions running, and apply all configuration changes (with the exception of direct connection and compression disabling, since reloading wouldnt re-inject). Do we also want to e.g. re-populate the item and block registries? Currently, only the resource pack registry would be re-populated.\r\n\r\n**TODO:**\r\n- [x] thorough testing on all platforms\r\nInitial testing seems to work, need to confirm once again after the structure is more finalized \r\n\r\n- [x] ensure cloud pr compatibility - specifically, whether we can re-register extension commands easily. If not, that will either require per-platform handling, or a rework of how extensions and geyser reload work together\r\n\r\ndone - turns out that we *can't* add new or remove existing commands, with or without cloud. That's unfortunate, and opens the question of how we want to handle that.\r\n\r\n- [x] verify spigot's reload command works, and if needed, adjust `GeyserImpl#reload`\r\nWorks out of the box, doesn't even differ from reloading handling; need to commit that change though.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hey! This latest api PR of mine adds a few very cool Bedrock-exclusive features to the Geyser API: Cameras and Input locking!\r\n\r\nThis includes the ability to:\r\n- Lock the player into a perspective (first person/third person/third person front)\r\n- Send colored camera fades (in other terms, \"cutscreens\")\r\n- Camera movements/transitions\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this adds the following:\r\n- api to lock player inputs - camera, movement control, or both\r\n- exposes a Vector3f position in the `GeyserPlayerEntity` to be able to point cameras at them etc (Otherwise, extensions are pretty much locked out of using this new PR :/)\r\n\r\n## API Additions\r\n\r\n### `GeyserConnection.class`\r\n\r\n+ `@NonNull EntityData entities();` returns the EntityData class that contains entity methods. showEmote, entityByJavaId and playerEntity are exposed there and deprecated in GeyserConnection\r\n\r\n+ `@NonNull CameraData camera()` returns the CameraData class that contains methods to control the camera. Fog, camera shake, and camera locking/the new camera stuff is found here.\r\n\r\n### `api/bedrock/camera` - Contains the new camera stuff\r\n`enum CameraEaseType` contains ease types (https://easings.net/) that control how the camera is moved to the new position. These are hard-coded in cloudburst aswell, and you can't add custom ones\r\n\r\n`enum CameraPerspective` - contains the possible forced perspectives (first person, third person, third person front)\r\n\r\n`interface CameraFade` Allows creating a camera fade (also with builder).\r\n\r\n`interface CameraPosition` Allows creating a camera position (with optional fading to position)\r\n\r\n### `interface CameraData` Contains the new camera methods:\r\n+ `@Nullable CameraPerspective forcedCameraPerspective();` - returns current forced CameraPerspective, or null if none is forced.\r\n+ `void forceCameraPerspective(@NonNull CameraPerspective perspective);` - forces a CameraPerspective on the player, which can't be switched client-side.\r\n\r\n+ `void sendCameraFade(CameraFade fade);` - Sends a CameraFade to the player\r\n+ `void sendCameraPosition(CameraPosition position);` - Sends a camera position (can include movement animations by setting an easetype) to the player\r\n+ `void clearCameraInstructions();` - Resets/stops all camera instructions (fade, camera position, forced camera perspectives)\r\n\r\n+ `boolean isCameraLocked();` returns whether the camera is locked\r\n+ `boolean lockCamera(boolean lock, @NonNull UUID owner);` allows someone to lock the camera - when locked, a player cannot look around until unlocked. The UUID is used to ensure that multiple api users can send lock/unlock requests as needed, without accidental unlocking\r\n\r\nFor documentation on camera fades and camera position (and their limitations), see the [microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/cameracommandintroduction?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable). Only difference - there isnt much point to allowing the creation of custom presets that extend existing ones imo, so i've created geyser:free_audio, geyser:free_effects and geyser:free_audio_effects to cover those 2 usecases too. Setting position/rotation defaults imo isnt really useful in our usage.\r\n\r\n- Added cloudburst math in the ap\r\n\r\n### `GeyserPlayerEntity`\r\n+ added a `Vector3f position();` method to get the player's current position\r\n\r\n### `EntityData`\r\nContains the entityByJavaId, showEmote, and playerEntity methods. The equivalents are deprecated in the GeyserConnection class\r\n\r\n## Internal changes\r\n- new CameraUtils class to store CameraPresets/NamedDefinitions\r\n- new bedrock/camera folder, no clue where else to put bedrock specific stuff like that in core\r\n\r\nI'll update this PR description after the changes have been more finalized - in the current form, it already seems to work, but i'd expect that feedback will change it's structure a fair bit more.\r\n\r\nRFC's:\r\n- ~~Should we expose r/g/b individually in the fade, or maybe `java.awt.Color` instead?~~ Uses java.awt.Color now\r\n- ~~See above - exposing position -> exposing cloudburst math in api?~~ done\r\n- Currently, forcing a player perspective takes in a `CameraPerspective`, which also contains the free perspective, but you cant actually set a free perspective there (since that would require a position). I could either remove `free` from the CameraPerspective - which then wouldnt properly show a forcedPerspective whenever the client is forced to a free perspective (aka, disconnected camera from the player set to basically anywhere)... idk, open for feedback on that one.\r\nProperly documented now. \r\n\r\nOutlook:\r\nThe changes here could be used to allow geyser players to spectate entities. However, we must ensure that our usage of the camera positions would not interfere/be blocked by api - not sure how that would be handled correctly.\r\n\r\nI'll release an extension to test these api additions in more detail in the coming days aswell.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary></summary>\r\n  \r\nIf you read this, you're cool :p\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

    "body": "Since 1.20.30, it is possible to send clients a link to download a resource pack from - instead of having to add the pack to Geyser's pack folder. This should help with proxy networks & overall traffic usage, as now resource intensive pack sending can be offloaded to a designated location. However, unlike on Java, it is possible to send multiple entries for the client to load packs from!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This will only work on 1.20.30 and up. A workaround can be to block all versions below using the [BlockVersion](https://github.com/onebeastchris/BlockVersion) extension. ~~Or, an extension/a plugin could manually query the Bedrock client version and add either a link, or a pack (depending on version).~~ Update: If the client fails at getting the packs from the url, or does not support the entries, it will request the packs the old way.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- add new `GeyserUrlPackCodec` (and `UrlPackCodec` for api) that can create a pack based on url + content key\r\n- add a `resource-pack-urls` entry in the config for remote packs\r\n- try and use more fastutil for resource packs\r\n\r\nRFC:\r\n- ~~Should users be able to set pack encryption keys for the url's in the config?~~ No, users should use api instead for that.\r\n- ~~What should be done if the link stops working (e.g. because packs do not actually provide the correct pack anymore? Should Geyser then attempt to reload all packs (or just the remote packs)?~~ Geyser will then serve the cached pack, and re-run a check of the url once - and warn about it.\n\r\nWe can detect it if the client sends a `ResourcePackChunkRequestPacket` - if the pack requested there is one with the UrlPackCodec, we can assume that either ~~1. the client does not support remote pack~~ to my knowledge , all platforms now do, or that 2. the remote pack changed/an error occurred/etc and that Geyser might want to re-check it.\r\nHowever, it is not currently possible to modify registry contents, which makes that a bit more challenging. \r\n-  ~~Should Geyser download the remote packs once and provide that, or should Geyser rather try and get it directly from the url?~~ We'll be downloading the pack once, and cache it to avoid unnecessary re-downloads\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Testing; more of it\r\n- [x] javadocs spellchecks\r\n- [ ] Proper error handling: URL invalid/offline, corrupt pack, manifest not where it's supposed to be, etc. \r\n- [x] documentation on wiki\r\n- [x] remove debug\r\n- [x] dont let resource pack downloading block main thread - this is actually wanted; since Geyser should not start before we know all the resource packs\r\n- [x] Don't re-download the pack if there's no need to (hash from url + size)\r\n\r\nWould close https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/4060 - atleast the resource pack part.

      "In the config I would use, probably, `resource-pack-urls` or `remote-resource-packs`. I don't think most people will understand what a CDN is, and some resource packs won't be hosted on content delivery networks per se.",
      "Yeah naming really isn't my strong suit, I agree. I kind of like RemotePack actually.\nOr we could take a page from kyori's adventure, their new resource pack method takes in a `ResourcePackRequest (Like)`.. not sure I really like that though. Open for suggestions :)",
      "How exactly are pack versions handled with this? Is it just pulled from the downloaded pack? What happens if the version of the pack at the link is updated while the server is running?",
      "We don't extract / need the pack version, just the pack UUID. Konica and I had a brief talk where he mentioned that possibility where a pack UUID might change mid-game. \nSince we can't really detect that, the next best thing would be to use some kind of cache and re-download the configured packs to re-check the pack ids.\nThis still leaves the question of what to do with api - imo we shouldn't do the same check for those remote packs provided there, since they need to provide the pack UUID themselves.\n\nPossible solutions:\n- add a user-facing reload command that would re-gather all remote pack uuids\n(e.g. /geyser reload packs) or similar; would also close a different issue \n- Could expose an api method that downloads the pack, extracts it & provides a UUID version to avoid duplicate code in extensions that also want to check\n- Could add a secondary registerRemotePacks/..CdnPacks method to the GeyserDefineResourcePacks only that would allow providing just a url and leave us querying the pack id ourselves.\n\nMore generally, we'd need to find out what exactly the client would do in the event that the pack is provided and the one received in said pack mismatch.",
      "Hmm ok but then how does this work? Does this mean the client has to download the entire pack every time to check if the version changed? The normal [ResourcePackStack](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Protocol/blob/3.0/bedrock-codec/src/main/java/org/cloudburstmc/protocol/bedrock/packet/ResourcePackStackPacket.java#L37) and [ResourcePacksInfo](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Protocol/blob/3.0/bedrock-codec/src/main/java/org/cloudburstmc/protocol/bedrock/packet/ResourcePacksInfoPacket.java#L38) packets have a field for version. So does a CDN entry also require an entry in the normal Entry list and this just tells the client where it can download said pack? Or will the client just download a CDN entry and not check the version at all?\r\n\r\nI'm mainly wondering how this works if the user just adds an entry to their config for one of these. In this scenario you're saying we never have to know the pack version?",
      "~~By what I can tell, we never have to get/tell the client the pack version.This does raise the question of whether the client will always download the pack...~~\nI'll definitely have to do more testing here; I am not fully sure about the exact workings of this feature. In my (brief) testing, the optional pack seems to have been loaded fine.\n\nAfter some testing:\n- We need to send an entry in the ResourcePackInfo packet, even for these cdn packs. \n- the \"packid\" in the cdn entry consists of uuid_version, not just the UUID\n- the client falls back to requesting the packs normally/the old way if the download didn't succeed\n- We can actually detect the last part, and try and re-load packs. Not sure if we can do that fully automatically, but in theory, should be doable.",
      "From more testing locally, here's what i found:\r\nThis PR should be functional, but Bedrock is *very* picky about what sort of packs from a url are accepted/downloaded.\r\n\r\n- The link must be a direct link.\r\n- The size must be set properly in the `Content-Length` header. If size is wrong, or not present (-1), the client will show a bogus, stupidly large size value and wont allow downloading the packs.\r\n- Similarly, the `Content-Type` header must be set to `application/zip` - otherwise, the client wont download the resource packs.\r\n\r\nFurther, the resource pack can be either a `.zip` or `.mcpacks` file that does *not* contain the pack files at its root, but rather a folder with the actual resource pack. (In other words: zip/manifest.json wont work, zip/mypack/manifest.json will....)\r\n\r\nIf anyone wishes to test this PR, you can set up a working file server using [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) and the following config - please do *not* use it in production, it doesnt even use https.\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost {\r\n    file_server browse\r\n    route {\r\n        header Content-Type application/zip\r\n        header Content-Length {file.size}\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt however would ensure correct content type/content lengths being set.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, downloading even a 100MB pack is insanely quick!",
      "Is it possible we can make a website that tests if a website hosting a pack is working correctly? We can also bundle such functionality in Geyser, but a website means it would be applicable to a wider Bedrock audience.",
      "Said functionality would already be bundled in this PR :)\nWe're basically downloading the pack once to get all the info, and while at it, we check size/content type/manifest location (which, to my knowledge, is what's required).\nAs for creating a separate website - sure, but I think that would be a bit out of scope for this PR, but it's not a bad idea in theory.",
      "OK, neat. We should add to the config comment that you should expect your pack to be analyzed/downloaded within Geyser.",
      "Well, we basically have to download it. We need to include the pack in the same resource pack stack packet, and we need to get the UUID/version for it.\nAnother neat thing is that we can also detect if the url doesn't properly work anymore (e.g. pack changed mid download/link offline), and then Geyser would re-test the pack.",
      "Put on hold until we transition to using configurate - otherwise these changes will result in confusion about why packs are loaded that don't seem to be in the config.",

Cool. For example, the FN3perm plugin does that.\r\nAs for the fix - since client side gamemode switching isn't too harmless (e.g. allows flying) - i've now added a check for *both* the permission value and the `geyser.settings.server` permission.\r\n\r\nDownside:\r\n- buttons aren't grayed out, but that can be argued is the fault of plugins that send this high permission value\r\n- We can't gray them out by relying on both options to set the PlayerPermission/CommandPermission level, as that would remove the access to e.g. the Bedrock command completion.

While also present in all server api's (paper, velocity, fabric etc), this one can be used by Extensions specifically to e.g. log which disconnect reasons occur, or to change disconnect reasons. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe way how disconnects are handled currently are quite... complicated, since there are 4 possible ways where session.disconnect is called normally:\r\n- when the java server disconnects the session in either [JavaLoginDisconnectTranslator](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/geysermc/geyser/translator/protocol/java/JavaLoginDisconnectTranslator.java), or the [JavaDisconnectTranslator](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/geysermc/geyser/translator/protocol/java/JavaDisconnectTranslator.java).\r\n- when the bedrock connection is closed, GeyserSession.disconnect() is called to close the java server connection: [here](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/geysermc/geyser/network/UpstreamPacketHandler.java#L121-L128)\r\n- LoginEncryptionUtils/UpstreamPacketHandler for stuff like invalid chain/unsupported version/etc\r\n- Finally, by the [SessionManager](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/geysermc/geyser/session/SessionManager.java#L92-L97). This however is broken; even though upstream.disconnect is called the client never gets the disconnect message and times out.\r\n\r\nThis is all fine and well, but leaves the question of where to put this new SessionDisconnectEvent to avoid it firing twice.\r\nMy initial thought would be to add it to [UpstreamSession](https://github.com/onebeastchris/Geyser/blob/leave-event/core/src/main/java/org/geysermc/geyser/session/UpstreamSession.java#L63-L71)'s disconnect method; but that has a few problems: \r\n- It isnt called when the Bedrock client disconnects (while GeyserSession.disconnect() is called; upstream.isClosed prohibits calling upstream.disconnect()\r\n- Additionally to that, when the emulated Java client disconnects, it also calls upstream.disconnect() [here](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/geysermc/geyser/session/GeyserSession.java#L1031). \r\n\r\nMy proposed fix that I've implemented in https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/4052/commits/2abf1af26b2acbab2f6e26427c4a0eb92b49ca5f :\r\n- fire the SessionDisconnectEvent in GeyserSession.disconnect(), since that is already \"gated\" to not fire twice (@Camotoy , you were right; but atleast i can fix some other minor issues while at it :p)\r\n\r\nOther minor tweaks:\r\n- Stop the DisconnectedEvent from calling upstream.disconnect() directly and let it call GeyserSession.disconnect() instead (Since otherwise; the SessionDisconnectEvent fired in GeyserSession.disconnect() can not change the disconnect message). \r\n- There is no need to call downstream.disconnect() if the downstream session is already closed in GeyserSession.disconnect()\r\n- add a few comments\r\n- Imo there is no need to print a full stacktrace when a connection is impossible due to e.g. the server being offline; gated that behind debug mode\r\n- /geyser reload now properly kicks players (added a 10ms wait before executing reload.. while hacky, i dont see any other solution here). /geyser stop still leaves players hanging to time out; not sure how to do that \r\n-> From testing; it looks like upstream.disconnect() is called for each player; but is then somehow interrupted?

The reason something like this hasn't been implemented before is because, in theory, we can pull them directly from Java resource packs, but I know this can't encapsulate all uses.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd prefer the folder be named `overrides`.",
      "Pulling from the resource packs would basically be doing the same thing. The way this was intended to be used is basically just taking those lang files out of your already custom made rp and placing them in the overwrites folder. I did not know that was a planned feature. Is there a roadmap for that? I made this as we needed it for a server that makes use of translations and there is currently not really a feasible way of doing so.\n\nThough I could still see this as having some benefits. This method does not require to download the whole rp file just to grab those lang files, which could add some latency on player join or the potential to join before the translations are loaded(if done async).\n\nI can change the name of folder. I could also rework this to load a rp from disk instead? That way it could still exist as a way to manually supply the rp alongside the automatic rp downloading(and potentially exist before that is implemented)?",
      "Also this behavior is a bit different from a java client. It is technically possible to send the resourcepack request packet at anytime, and only to specific players. This means it's possible for different players to have different rps and translations at different times. See [here for an example](https://github.com/kyrptonaught/SwitchableResourcepacks).\n\nThe current translation implementation is global for all players, though that is out of scope for this pr. ",
      "I had forgotten about this, glad to see it's making progress :) \n\nI also forgot to mention: addCustomTranslations was intended to be used as an api for extensions to add their own translations. As far as I know, there is no universal way for an extension to do that and they must handle translations on their own. \n\nMy intended implementation for this was not complete in this PR as I wasn't sure the route geyser wanted to go with that. How are other things translated? From what I know everything is translated by geyser before being sent to the client using the mojang provided lang files. But what about custom things like Blocks, Items, Forms, CMD feedback, Chat messages added by extensions? That has to be done manually and is up to the developer to come up with an implementation. I haven't spent much time developing for geyser so my knowledge of this may be wrong, but I am very familiar with fabric mod development.\n\nMaybe lang files could be loaded as resources in the extension jar, similar to how a forge/fabric mod does it? And then geyser could automatically handle any piece of text marked as translatable, similar to how vanilla does it? ",
      "You do raise some interesting questions, and here's my take:\n\n- An extension that would provide Java translations to an existing Java plugin/mod does sound like a potential usecase  that we should support, but that poses other questions, such as fallbacks for strings only provided in some languages etc.\n\n- Geyser does translate things automatically, yeah. That includes chat messages, item/block names, etc. However, Bedrock also has its own translation string system - which Geyser uses to send item/block names and similar. Imo it doesn't make sense to add these in api, since they would be handled on a Bedrock edition resource pack instead.\n\nAs for forms specifically - those can have a translator attached to them, which can be used to dynamically translate forms.\n\nI do think, that overall, such api would rather warrant it's own PR - and would probably have to be discussed/thought out internally first.\nFrom personal experience with extensions + and implementing multi-language support for pickapck, it did feel like that's something that could be a system within Geyser's api. It does provide the locale, and for very common logic such as locale properties parsing that really could be useful for extensions."

    "body": "Hey! \r\nSince 1.20.10, there's a recipe unlocking system. Since it is currently still experimental, we would have to enable \"recipe_unlocking\", but the good thing here is, that old versions would be unaffected by this change.\r\n\r\nChanges necessary:\r\n- When java sends a ClientboundRecipePacket, a recipe id is sent instead of a full recipe. Hence why we need to store all Bedrock recipe identifiers for all matching Java edition recipes.\r\n- MultiRecipes are not sent, and appear to be always unlocked.\r\n- ~~While we could still just use random uuid's as the recipe identifiers, using the java identifiers wherever possible could allow reducing the stored recipe identifiers to only those that do have multiple Bedrock recipes~~ Doesn't really matter\r\n\r\nLeft to do:\r\n- [x] More testing, lol\r\n- [x] ~~Add java recipe identifiers to our recipe.json mappings - otherwise, those would never be unlocked~~ Turns out: While Java edition has recipe identifiers for these special recipes (e.g. minecraft:suspicious_stew, or minecraft:shulker_box_coloring, or minecraft:tipped_arrow), which do show up as autocomplete options with the /recipe command, those cannot be given/taken away, and they do not show up in the recipe book on Java edition - hence, we probably shouldn't either :p\r\nEdit # 2: while java doesnt unlock these, we probably will do so forcefully - to make sure it works similarly as it does on Bedrock edition itself.\r\n- [x] Smithing templates/trim recipe unlocking\r\n- [x] ~~Add furnace/blasting/smoker recipes - while there is no use for them on Bedrock as far as i can see, BDS sends them, so i would assume they might add that in the future. Also, the pop-up is still there~~ I was mistaken. Bedrock seemingly sends them during recipe definition, but doesn't actually lock/unlock them - however, this *might* allow us to define custom furnace recipes? probably not though. EDIT: No need to add/translate these currently - custom recipes already work, and since they're not (un)locked, no need to store recipe identifiers. Heck, don't even need to send the recipe :p\r\n\r\nNot strictly related to recipe unlocking, but.. why not:\r\n~~- [x] Only send smithing template recipes if the server does too~~ Implemented in https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/commit/706d1b96270df004b8dda74f0611e28d689747ff\r\n~~-Fix hanging sign crafting recipe, presumably related to the chains in the recipe\r\nGeyser broken vs BDS: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/b62c8fa3ad1247c7bc37e2f17da91760\r\nGeyser works vs broken: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/38c4eabd01a146af9e68477fd81bbd9d\r\nSeems to be due to the block definition sent in the recipe result.~~\r\nNot fixing it in this PR, not sure how to fix.\r\n- [x] add multirecipe for decorated pots, should make making them smoother:\r\nThere are two new multirecipe uuids, one for decorated pots (added in [1.19.70.23](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/13133616291981-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-19-70-23), see [here](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockData/blame/master/recipes/special_hardcoded.json), and one in 1.19.80; presumably for then [added](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/14012352627853-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-19-80-21) trims?) Java edition also sends a sort of multirecipe once, so an extra case where we also send that multirecipe should do the trick here.\r\n- [x] Allow different wood types be mixed in recipes when appropriate, e.g. shields/campfires/sticks etc. Fixes https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/3784 - completed with https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/4016/commits/81d7386292877730365152519ce550cfd0973ae9\r\n\r\nRFC: What would be the best way to handle storing Java -> Bedrock recipe identifiers? Per session, or versioned registry? \r\n\r\nMore fun things:\r\nhttps://paste.gg/p/anonymous/dbafa96a204a40a8a04c997ac4a9c171 all bedrock recipe identifiers (1.20.12 BDS)\r\nhttps://paste.gg/p/anonymous/fd13b5a490ba47caae96e76eb0e58d86 all MultiRecipes, probably worth checking out what the rest does\r\nWould appreciate some feedback, just for cleaner impl",

This actually is the reason I made this pull request. I wrote my own implementation of Yggdrasil, that allows players with legitimate Microsoft accounts to connect to the server normally, while letting me create additional accounts for Bedrock Edition players.\r\n* Allowing admins to log in as other players.\r\n* Being able to play on your own online-mode server when you don't have an internet connection, without losing progression.\r\n* Being able to utilize the security benefits of online-mode instead needing to use offline mode and login plugins (which also isn't possible in vanilla). Aside from cracked servers, this is also useful for people in countries where access to the official servers is blocked.\r\n* People refusing to migrate to Microsoft accounts / wanting to disable telemetry / chat reporting without needing to mod the game.\r\n\r\nThis has already been requested in issues such as #1095, and the reason for not implementing it at the time was due to the libraries being used not supporting it, however this has since been resolved, therefore I made this pull request.",

      "So this would work when we remove Mojang account support, and only Microsoft accounts can log in? \n\nIf so, I would make this system property territory. ",
      "The session server related part responsible for joining a server doen't need to be touched, they work the same way with both Mojang and Microsoft accounts.\r\n\r\nHowever, the auth server related part responsible obtaining the access token would need to be changed, but I would need to know what changes you are planning to Geyser / MCAuthLib / MCProtocolLib to remove Mojang account support.\r\n\r\nThe way I can imagine it is that when you connect to the Geyser server, it jumps immediately to the login form instead of giving you two options (log in with Mojang / Microsoft account). Of course for this to work, password authentication has to be enabled in the Geyser config. Then when the user submits the form, if the custom auth servers are configured, it attempts to authenticate with those, otherwise it does so with the official ones.\r\n\r\nIn terms of code, getting the access token relies on the MojangAuthenticationService class, since the API used by it it is what these third-party Yggdrasil implementations try to replicate. In theory, they could also implement the various Microsoft endpoints too (Microsoft OAuth, Xbox, etc.), although there wouldn't be much of a point in doing so.\r\n\r\nThe system property way is how the vanilla client and server lets you change the endpoints, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to replicate it in Geyser.",
      "Geyser will be completely removing password support when Mojang account support is dropped, as it's insecure and dangerous to transmit your password to a server that can easily decrypt and see the password.",
      "Mojang account support was already dropped about a year ago in a sense that Mojang accounts can't join online mode servers, even with third party launchers. The only thing Mojang accounts can do as of right now is to log in to Minecraft.net and migrate, as well as play in single player / offline-mode servers with third party launchers, and after September 19, 2023 neither of these will be possible anymore.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason Geyser hasn't removed Mojang accounts already?\r\n\r\nAs for the custom Yggdrasil implementations, they basically all implement the same username / password API that Mojang used before the migration to obtain the access token, which you plan on removing support for.\r\n\r\nI could of course make up a custom authentication flow for my Yggdrasil implementation, and put that in the pull requests, but that would only work with my implementation, while the Mojang flow was a \"standard\" that most third-party implementations copied.\r\n\r\nA much better way in my opinion would be to use let users specify the access token directly instead of a username / password used to obtain one in the Geyser configuration file, then in my Yggdrasil server implementation I could give this specific token special treatment: \"if this token is used, the user would be authorized to log in, regardless of their username / UUID\". This would basically mean that any Bedrock Edition player would be able to log in with their Bedrock Edition username / UUID, without having to provide an extra username / password combination that they registered on my Yggdrasil server into a form in-game. What do you think of this method?",
      "I think at this point, we won't accept this PR. Joining vanilla servers without offline mode is a valid use-case, in my opinion, but we will drop Mojang account support on September 19th alongside Minecraft. \r\nI'd rather add the necessary username/password/auth token changes via an extension (the necessary events may be required anyway for good ViaVersion integration), and system properties to control the auth URLs. \r\nI'm going to close this PR but discussion is free to continue."

      "no longer a draft, ready for reviews:\r\n- api changes (including pack loading) work, tested them with the same extension (but updated to latest changes)\r\n- pack loading (encrypted packs aswell according to @Konicai ) works same as before\r\n\r\nChanges since last reviews:\r\n- ResourcePack and ResourcePackManifest are now interfaces, with records implementing them in geyser core\r\n- huge thanks to konica to re-working pack loading system & exposing pack loading properly to api\r\n- (hopefully) proper documentation of new api\r\n- Packs are loaded via Registry now",
      "Also, you are missing jackson annotations on the `formatVersion` and `minimumSupportedMinecraftVersion`. Their keys in the manifest are actually `format_version` and `min_engine_version` (which is why the annotations are required). Look at the old deleted ResourcePack class for how it was done\r\n\r\nI don't think jackson complains about missing members unless you tell it to, so you'll have to test to make sure that all the fields are being properly loaded",

This should give us a little bit of extra speed since we now have a second gradle build job for modrinth, so the same daemon should be able to be reused.  \r\n\r\nThis now means the cache can only be written on the master branch, but other branches can access the cache.

Rather than looking at rain as a boolean, we now properly set the rain strength as specified in the rain strength packet from Java. Per info from the PocketMine devs and my own testing, rain strength on Bedrock ranges from 0 to 65535 and is applies via the data field of `LevelEventType.START_RAINING`. We also properly set `START_RAIN` as stopping rain, and `STOP_RAIN` as starting rain. Oddly enough, this is inline with Java behavior, as it seems these packets were intended to be the beginning of a gradient that slowly begins or ends the storm. However, this is of course up to the server's implementation since it controls rain strength through the RAIN_STRENGTH packet.\r\n\r\nWe do the same for THUNDER_STRENGTH.\r\n\r\nTested with standard weather command, as well as Worldguard's weather lock, which appeared to be causing issues before.

Furthermore, the Gradle build files it hashes to tag the cache do not really make sense for Geyser, being a multi-module project. See https://github.com/actions/setup-java#caching-packages-dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis PR properly caches these, cutting build times in half.\r\n- [Before Caching](https://github.com/Kas-tle/Geyser/actions/runs/4332647023/jobs/7565280185) (5:22)\r\n- [After Caching](https://github.com/Kas-tle/Geyser/actions/runs/4332697239/jobs/7565363184) (2:49)\r\n\r\nCaches are kept separate by branch to ensure no weirdness and that any changes on other branches cannot affect the cache of master. I have also intentionally chosen not to include PRs in caching. This is because the Github repo cache limit is 10GB, and the current cache size with this PR is ~690MB. When the 10GB limit is reached, caches are removed in order of longest last access time until there is space for the new cache. I would like to avoid the possibility of too many PRs leading to the deletion of the master cache, and thus increasing build times for master. But this can easily be added in if you do not believe it is an issue. Note that while it would also be possible to share the caches for PRs and main builds, I would also like to avoid the possibility of any sort of cache injection by a PR...\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds exclusions so that no build is pushed when files that would not lead to a change in the underlying build are modified, such as the README: https://github.com/Kas-tle/Geyser/blob/feature/actions-cache/.github/workflows/build.yml#L5-L14\r\n\r\nI also add saving of build artifacts for the main build action. I don't really see any reason not to do this.\r\n\r\nFinally, both the PR action and Build action are modified to ensure the action is failed if the proper platform artifacts don't exist.\r\n\r\nBy request from @rtm516, the ability to manually trigger the workflow is also added by adding the `workflow_dispatch` event. This allows manually triggering of actions like so: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow",

This seems to occur because the isModule check seems to return true in many cases https://github.com/KyoriPowered/indra/blob/main/3.x/indra-common/src/main/java/net/kyori/indra/internal/ModularityDetecter.java#L53-L117. \r\n\r\nThe eclipse plugin can be used to undo this change, and adventure even has to do this for their logger: https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure/blob/main/4/text-logger-slf4j/build.gradle.kts#L36-L45.\r\n\r\nNote that this only affects behavior for those using the Eclipse IDE (or other implementations of Eclipse Buildship such as the VSCode Java Language Extension). There is absolutely no change to the build process in any other circumstances.\r\n\r\nI made a similar PR for issues with building eclipse in Floodgate (https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate/pull/381) and received some internal push back since Eclipse is much less common, especially among those that contribute to this project. But I really don't get this sentiment. I think it benefits Geyser and open source projects in general to make it as easy to contribute as possible. And part of that is making Geyser work in a potential contributors IDE of choice. I think that most people looking to contribute that use Eclipse in the current state of the project would likely just give up and move onto something else, as I doubt they'd be inclined to troubleshoot the obscure behavior of one of the build plugins. While I understand that one response to this may be \"just use IntelliJ\", I really don't see the argument when we can easily make it compatible with 0 impact on users of other IDEs and Geyser's build and publishing process.",

Personally I experience it on an iPhone XR, and the person reporting it had it on both iPhone and Switch. XBox was not affected for the person reporting.

    "body": "### Major thanks to Amberichu for all her help with this! 🎉 \r\n\r\nThis PR builds off of her initial skull and custom block registry system. It adds support for registration of custom blocks via both extensions and mappings. Via mappings, the user can override either specific blockstates, or all blockstates for a given block. A `blocks` section may be simply added to existing files in `custom_mappings`. The structure of the mappings is described in the preview documentation.\r\nPreview documentation: https://pages.kastle.dev/geyser/custom-blocks/\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is support for registering specific skulls via a config file. These skulls are incorporated into a resource pack generated by Geyser on startup.\r\nPreview documentation: https://pages.kastle.dev/geyser/custom-skulls/\r\n\r\nI know we'll probably have a long road to getting this merged, but I'm ready to get started with whatever changes need to be made. Just let me know. Also feel free to commit to my branch directly if you so choose.\r\n\r\nAccompanying PR has been made on the wiki for documentation of these new features. See https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserWiki/pull/115\r\n\r\n@Camotoy (to figure out the branch stuff)\r\n\r\n### Major Caveats\r\n- ~~Break speeds will be completely broken for vanilla tools. This cannot be fixed at this time. We can likely fix for custom tools once https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/3381 is merged.~~ Thanks to a suggestion from Camotoy, we can calculate the break time server side and simply break the block for the client when needed. See https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/3505/commits/29835a1b76013737bf716391c48fcadf08adc090\r\n- ~~Hit boxes cannot extend outside 1x1x1 block. This means blocks like walls and fences can effectively be jumped over by bedrock players. We could perhaps work around this by adding either solid entities or invisible blocks above blocks with a collision box that extend outside this size.~~ I implemented the proposed workaround; see https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/3505/commits/7f85e909b8fb5be7299584f167ebdeb02714bf3e and https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/3505/commits/5f5159d30e095041921ffbfa20ba57c7db953352 (primarily). The only minor inconvenience here is an unknown geometry warning will be displayed without a slight change to GeyserOptionalPack, but there is not other change in function beyond the content log error. Note that we still have the issue of being limited to cuboid shaped collision boxes, but for now this is a Mojang limitation we cannot control.\r\n- Blocks with native GUIs will not work.\r\n- ~~Blocks are not overridden in the creative inventory. To accomplish this, we would need a way to programmatically map the blocks in each [creative category](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/documentation/creative-categories.html#for-blocks). This would probably require futzing around with [pmmp/bds-mod-mapping](https://github.com/pmmp/bds-mod-mapping).~~ This can now be done as long as the creative category and group is specified in the mappings.\r\n- Block geometries are limited to 1.875x1.875x1.875. This limitation is expressly imposed by Mojang and is unlikely to change. See https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-152191. Note that currently this can *technically* be worked around since as of 1.20.12 the transformation component seems to bypass size limits, but note that 1. a content log warning is displayed and 2. there is an open bug regarding this with an ADO (see https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-173799) implying that this will likely be patched in the future.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I see this as primarily a cosmetic feature. We can do our best to make the components work, but it would be ill advised for anyone to rely on them working.",

The base API has also been expanded and updated for an eventual merge of Floodgate into Geyser.\r\n\r\nThis update also changes the build system from Maven to Gradle. Gradle opens the door for numerous possibilities in the future, and will allow us to finally merge [Geyser Fabric](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser-Fabric) into the main repository, and will also open the door for us to expand to other platforms such as Forge in the future. It also simplifies a lot of our existing toolchain which was quite cumbersome to deal with in Maven given the scale of the Geyser project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis update is the culmination of many hours of work from multiple developers (big shoutout to @ImDaBigBoss for starting on the system as well as @Konicai, @Tim203, @Kas-tle and @Camotoy for their contributions). Given the sheer scale of this update, testing is important to ensure everything works as intended. Builds can be downloaded from our CI server [here](https://ci.opencollab.dev//job/GeyserMC/job/Geyser/job/master/). \r\n\r\nFor any developers curious about testing out the API / extensions system, feel free to refer to the [HideCommands](https://github.com/RednedEpic/HideCommands) extension as a place to start. Docs are still in the works but should be rolling out soon.\r\n\r\nAlthough we don't anticipate this to be bug-free initially, generally it should be quite stable in terms of testing. If you do wish to test this, please let us know how it goes either in the comments of this PR or on Discord. \r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has helped create this system or given feedback along the way!

I'm quite keen to get this merged ASAP, as I am currently borrowing my friend's PS4 to develop & test this change (Basically my whole reason for doing this is so that my friends and I can play splitscreen together when over at another house). If this takes more time, I'm afraid someone else will have to take over development of this. Hopefully these answers make sense:\r\n\r\n> We only _need_ the Xbox UUID for Floodgate, right? We can just set it to -1 for other platforms and bypass the need for a config option then.\r\n\r\nI haven't investigated this, but I would assume this wouldn't be possible since you'd need some way of associating an auth token with a player, and I'm not sure how that would be done in a secure fashion. Although I have limited knowledge of how all the authentication stuff works in general. I've only ever used Geyser in conjunction with Floodgate. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion I think we could just add documentation in the Wiki saying that splitscreen can only be used if Floodgate is enabled. Then support for vanilla Geyser without Floodgate can be added in a future PR.\r\n\r\n> Also - how is split-screen handled normally, say in a singleplayer world? If I join as Camotoy2 and then leave and then join as Camotoy3 is my progress saved between those two now?\r\n\r\nPlayer data is tied to your profile/account, so in your example progress would not be saved between them. However, with this XUID mapping I've done, you could theory do this:\r\n```\r\n  users:\r\n    Camotoy2:\r\n      bedrock-username: AccountOne\r\n      xuid: 0000000000000001\r\n    Camotoy3:\r\n      bedrock-username: AccountOne\r\n      xuid: 0000000000000001\r\n```\r\nWhere you have multiple console profiles tied to the same bedrock account. So logging in with either profile would use the same user. Floodgate would enforce it so that both profiles couldn't be playing simultaneously because they would be using the same bedrock account however.",

It's probably caused by duplicated packets from the client which corrupts the original finishing check.\r\n\r\nThough there's no direct field in the packet that indicates the user finishes editing, I'm only able to use some tricky way to determine when should we send the packet. In this PR, I delay the sign update packet until when player moving, doing action, editing another sign or disconnecting. Hope it helps and not causes more problem.\r\n\r\nAnd if there's better(or less tricky) way to solve this, I'd love to hear from you.😄",

      "Two other thoughts:\r\n- Do we need the previous sign check anymore?\r\n- Maybe combine these checks with the book edit check? I can do this later outside of this PR.",
      "Thanks for your thoughts. I combined these checks with the book edit check. And I found out the previous sign case was covered by the update at inventory transaction packet, now I removed that check.",
      "So I tested these changes, and they work. But I'm very conflicted if we should implement this. The current sign code, while it doesn't work for all instances, is much cleaner in how it's sent to the Java server. Unlike books, if the player gets hit while writing the sign, they're locked out of editing the sign (and likely very confused on what happened). We could add a config option, but I would hate a config option for a bug fix like this. But I also understand that editing a sign and seeing the behavior this PR fixes also sucks!\r\nI made a proof-of-concept where we listened to a Bukkit sign change event and allowed the player to always edit the sign, which modifies server behavior and requires Bukkit, but leads to a bit friendlier user experience.\r\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Advice wanted.",
      "Maybe we could check the server type first, then only modify the behavior on those Bukkit-based servers, and let the current solution to be a fallback.\r\n\r\nBut if we modify the behavior of bukkit, maybe we need to ensure it won't affect user's permission plugins like Residence or PlotSquared, that's possibly difficult.",
      "In my opinion, I support this PR because I think that this should be implemented -- signs are a crucial part of the game and I think it would be nice for Bedrock Edition players to be able to use them.\r\n\r\nDo we have an estimate on when this will be pushed to master?\r\n\r\nOn another note, I'll be testing this on my production server soon. However, are there any caveats with this PR? Will this affect anything?",
      "There is no estimate. The two downsides of this PR are that Bedrock players that get hit are locked out of the sign, and the sign changes will not apply until they move (once they are done). I'm working on, at the least, providing a hacky option for Paper servers to work around this.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this does not affect *every* Bedrock player. :bugrock:",

This results in an incorrect order of execution, since the `JavaMerchantOffersTranslator` depends on `MerchantInventoryTranslator#prepareInventory` (because that's where the fake villager of the merchant inventory is set - which in turn is needed). In this case, we queue all requests for a merchant inventory when a previous inventory has been closed. This request is executed immediately after the merchant inventory is opened.\r\n\r\nIssues that would be completely fixed (also tested):\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/1256\r\n- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/2543\r\n\r\n",

      "Code looks fine by me. The discussion internally has been about two things:\r\n- when the Java portion of our code is transferred over to also use the Protocol library, the plan is to discard authentication data after we no longer need it.\r\n- It would be easier to implement (some of?) the extension system and allow ViaVersion to be ran on Geyser.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm fine with this being a temporary addition before the switch of libraries. Afterwards, I don't want to change the authentication logic when indeed we could just ensure ViaVersion works connected directly to Geyser. Maybe we pull the jar loading from https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/742 and start there instead of implementing the whole API right away?"

(As a side note: This is the most confusing diff I have ever seen on. site, GitHub are you doing ok??)\r\n\r\nHi. The websocket part was made for the skin uploader. And because it is a websocket, I figured that I can also use it for pushing news (basically the update checker) when the news comes out.\r\nThe reason why I chose a websocket for the skin uploading is because it can take a while for a skin to upload (there is a queue) and one Geyser instance can be uploading quite a lot of skins.\r\nThere should probably be an option to disable skin uploading and checking news, yeah. I just forgot to make the config options."

If anyone (including myself) wants to withdraw money we have to submit an invoice (don't worry, its easy and they provide a template) which i can then accept or deny and the Open Source Collective will also have to accept it.\r\n\r\nThis may sound problematic, but as long as you fill out the fields correctly it is very likely to be accepted by the fiscal host.\r\n\r\n**This should be seen as a stop-gap until we get a unified [Open Collaboration](https://github.com/OpenCollaboration) donation method**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the collective page, I currently state the following:\r\n> This collective is run by and for the benefit of the independent contributors to the Geyser open source project. This collective is not endorsed or administered by Digital Tree Media Ltd. All donations made will be expended for the private benefit of or otherwise to reimburse individuals that do not have an employer/employee, contractor, or other agency relationship with Digital Tree Media Ltd.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is required to use the Open Source Collective, but its what [webpack](https://opencollective.com/webpack) states on their collective. The downside to this message is that @RednedEpic will not be able to receive donations (but it could be worse as he works for CubeCraft).

This is fixed by simply checking if the prefix and/or suffix equal \"null\" and if that is the case, replace it with \"\".\r\n\r\nAdded threshold option.\r\nGave the person who is running Geyser an option to specify the first Scoreboard packets per second threshold to further improve performance by lowering the setting or decrease performance by relaxing the setting a bit.

    "body": "## Changes:\r\n* Implement a transaction based system for resolving inventory changes. A new transaction is created which has all the actions to resolve it, with each action optionally requiring a confirmation step. For example all Click/Drops should only proceed after receiving an associated confirm packet otherwise out of order updates occur. This is also done asynchronously.\r\n* Provide better support for overriding functionality in child inventory translator classes by splitting the steps of resolution out separately.\r\n* Provide better support of refreshing of inventory by using an invalid click and then rejecting the returned packet after syncing the inventory.\r\n* Remove the forced refresh from all translators as they now take care of their updates in an ordered fashion. The only refresh left is now used only when the resolution system knows it may leak items (for example picking up an arbitrary amount from the furnace output is not supported on java).\r\n* Support resolving inventory changes that have more than 2 actions. This may resolve crafting recipes on some platforms and handle large inventory changes better\r\n* If geysers knowledge of an inventory item does not match that of the server and it is rejected we will resync before the retrying the action.\r\n* Added more documentation on whats happening in the inventory resolution.\r\n* Ensure that non click actions are executed at the appropriate location in a transaction through the use of a Runnable\r\n\r\nNote that this is a required merge for #536 which will have this merged in already. There are further optimizations that can be done and are in general marked with a TODO (sorry for the ping other todo) once the current resolution system is tested enough.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n* [x] Optimize resolution by making use of appropriate LEFT clicks or RIGHT clicks to slice a pickup down closer (especially useful for the furnace output slot)\r\n* [X] ~~Someone tests if this fixes crafting for consoles (I don't have one)~~\r\n* [x] Find out if there is any benefit or difference to using a setslot versus inventory packet for updating the cursor.\r\n* [x] Remove some of my debugging ToString annotations I left in by mistake.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n* [x] Swapping items between the hotbar and inventory seems to not work.

    "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nThis provides a Thread-safe Event Management System for Geyser. A native plugin system is also provided that can utilize the Event system through the use of 3rd party plugin jars.\r\n\r\n## Event System\r\n\r\n**Please refer to the live documentation for up to date information on how the system has been designed. This section is now outdated**\r\n\r\nAn event extends `GeyserEvent` or `GeyserCancellableEvent` and can be triggered using the EventManager container on the Connector instance. \r\n\r\nAll event handlers will be run in order of priority and handlers can choose to not get cancelled events.\r\n\r\nA handler can be defined using a lambda along with the expected event class. \r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n```java\r\n// Load all this data into memory\r\nmyHugeData = readAllTheData();\r\n\r\n// We want to save it all when Geyser Shuts down\r\neventManager.on(DisableEvent.class, (handler, event) -> {\r\n    writeAllTheData(myHugeData);\r\n}).build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n```java\r\n// We need to send this second packet only when we get a ResponsePacket\r\nsession.sendUpstreamPacket(somePacket);\r\neventManager.on(BedrockPacketReceiveEvent.class, (handler, event) -> {\r\n    session.sendUpstreamPacket(otherPacket);\r\n    handler.unregister(); // Unregister ourself\r\n  \r\n})\r\n    .filter(ResponsePacket.class)\r\n    .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nData for an event can be passed in the event object.\r\n\r\nEvents are triggered by creating a new object that inherits from GeyserEvent and calling the `trigger` method on the Event Manager.\r\n\r\n## Plugin System\r\n\r\n**Please refer to the live documentation for up to date information on how the system has been designed. This section is now outdated**\r\n\r\nA plugin system is also implemented to allow native Geyser Plugins to be written. This will reduce the amount of code that does not belong in the mainline by pulling it out into plugins that can optionally be used. It will also attract a community of developers who may not be interested in dealing with the low level aspects of Geyser but are happy to create useful optional features.\r\n\r\nThe plugin jar files are placed inside a `plugins` folder relative to the dataFolder of the appropriate bootstrap. This means relative to the jar for standalone and relative to its datafile folder for the other bootstraps. Each plugin can create its own datafolder under there as well.\r\n\r\nWe make use of a custom classloader that allows a plugin to also specify if it wishes to be part of the global namespace or not (default true). If it is global then other plugins may use its libraries and vice-versa, otherwise it is entirely independent and will not collide with other plugins.\r\n\r\nAn example plugin which runs on Geyser, Spigot and Bungeecord can be found [here](https://github.com/bundabrg/GeyserLink)\r\n\r\nPresently a class annotated with `@Plugin` and extending GeyserPlugin is looked for in the jar and is instantiated, becoming the plugin entrypoint. This annotation also defines all details about the plugin.\r\n\r\nAll event handlers are annotated by `@Event` and reflection is used to determine which event is hooked. Classes that event handers belong to must be registered with the plugin manager unless it is the main plugin class which is automatically registered.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n[Online Documentation](https://bundabrg.github.io/Geyser/)\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [Awesome Geyser Resources](https://github.com/bundabrg/awesome-geyser-resources) for a list of known plugins so far.\r\n\r\n## ToDo\r\n* [x] Proper Documentation\r\n* [x] Plugins should extend from an abstract class to provide helper methods\r\n* [x] Define a list of Events and where they can optimally be hooked into the code.\r\n* [x] Write a better example plugin perhaps one that provides custom filtering on the playerlist as it is easy to understand and by writing it help to know which events are useful.\r\n* [x] Will need #769 merged but we implement the same functionality here anyway for the moment\r\n* [x] Remove edit URL's from the PDF documentation generation\r\n* [x] Remove need for Context in Method Event Handlers\r\n* [x] Individual Packet Events\r\n* [ ] Command to show plugins loaded\r\n* ~~Handle cases where plugins may need to be run on specific platforms (spigot, standalone) by specifying requirements in the plugin annotation.~~ I'm now not so sure this is needed. A plugin writer should test for this using whatever method they wish.\r\n* [x] Implement a delombok step so we can javadoc event fields\r\n* [x] Provide easy method to inject packets to Geyser\r\n* [ ] Provide easy method to register commands not under the Geyser command (https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/1637)\r\n\r\n## Events Todo\r\n* [x] PluginMessageEvent + sending messages\r\n* [x] DownStreamPacketReceive\r\n* [x] DownStreamPacketSend\r\n* [x] UpstreamPacketReceive\r\n* [x] UpstreamPacketSend\r\n* [x] GeyserStartupEvent\r\n* [x] GeyserShutdownEvent\r\n* [x] PluginEnableEvent\r\n* [x] PluginDisableEvent\r\n* [x] Ping events\r\n\r\n## Optimization\r\n* If no event handlers then we might be able to short circuit some stuff. However as events may be useful to internal geyser code in the future this may quickly become a useless optimization\r\n",

    "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nThis provides the following:\r\n\r\n  * Developer support for multiple versions in the code. This makes it easier to support multiple editions using common code.\r\n  * Support for Minecraft Education Edition 1.12.60\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n  * This will not compile without first compiling this PR of Protocol which will bring in 2.5.7-SNAPSHOT: https://github.com/NukkitX/Protocol/pull/39\r\n  * `config.yml` is changed to allow you to select the edition of the bedrock listener. If you wish to support multiple versions at the same time you will need to run multiple copies of GeyserMC with different `config.yml` files\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* Temporarily Disable Github Action as this will not build till https://github.com/NukkitX/Protocol/pull/39 is merged\r\n* Add gamerule \"codebuilder\":\"false\" to disable MCEE code builder.\r\n* Update config.yml so that an edition is specified (bedrock or education)\r\n* Move away from automagic annotations to a dependency injection system. This allows versions to use the existing classes or redefine them.\r\n* Implement shims to allow the base codebase to have fewer changes. Any changes to the main codebase will flow into education unless it breaks and requires patching through a shim.\r\n* Move mappings and data resources to be namespaced by the edition (resources/edition)\r\n* Add SkinUtils shim to use legacy geometery data\r\n* Add LoginEncryptUtils shim to add a signedToken for education support. This is managed through a new TokenManager\r\n* Add BlockTranslator shim to handle block mappings with meta values\r\n* Fix respawning in Education as its Packets seem to be slightly different\r\n* Implement a Token Manager to handle OAuth2 tokens with both Microsoft and Minecraft servers. These are saved and updated in `tokens.yml`\r\n* Add new submodule for education mappings.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshot from MCEE 1.12.16 to 1.15.2 PaperMC server through both ProxyPass and GeyserMC: -\r\n\r\n![IMG_20200512_084641](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1607029/81665695-9af32f80-9473-11ea-93f7-86df3906beda.jpg)\r\n\r\n## How to host Minecraft Education\r\n\r\nThe main differences we are interested in between MCEE and MCPE is:\r\n  1. It runs an older slightly modified version of Bedrock.\r\n  2. It has security by only allowing users in the same tenant to connect\r\n\r\nPoint 2 means that the server must have a valid token for a client to connect otherwise the client will fail with an error indicating that the server is not allowed to be access.\r\n\r\n## Generating a new Tenant Token\r\nWhen a new MCEE tenant needs to be added use the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/geyser education new\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will provide a URL that must be copy and pasted into your web browser. It starts an OAuth2 authorization flow and allows you to log into your account. Once logged in you will just get a blank page with an address in your address bar. Copy this whole address into the next step.\r\n\r\nNow enter the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/geyser education confirm {copied response}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will go obtain the token and automatically save to `tokens.yml`.\r\n\r\nThe same user, and anyone else in the same tenant, can now log into the server. Multiple tenants are supported.\r\n\r\nAt no time does the server itself ever get access to the password of the user. It only gets access to an OAuth2 token that grants it access to specific minecraft resources and can renew this token indefinitely. If the user changes their password then the OAUTH token will be revoked.\r\n\r\n## Example Config\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\nbedrock:\r\n  # The IP address that will listen for connections\r\n  address: 0.0.0.0\r\n  # The port that will listen for connections\r\n  port: 19132\r\n  # The MOTD that will be broadcasted to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients\r\n  motd1: \"GeyserMC\"\r\n  motd2: \"Another GeyserMC forced host.\"\r\n\r\n  # Edition - bedrock or education\r\n  edition: bedrock\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\n1. ~~Getting the inital token is a little messy. Maybe a better way can be implemented.~~\r\n2. Users logging in with MCEE will have their Tenant username, and if supporting multiple tenants its possible for usernames to collide. Perhaps a prefix based upon the tenant needs to be added to the name or a cache of logged in users and any names that collide get suffixed with a number. If using my bleeding build which includes the plugin PR you may want to use [this plugin](https://github.com/bundabrg/geyserlogin) that allows a player to enter their own username of choice at login.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n* [x] Move the functionality of the Python token tool directly into Geyser so that it can be initiated with a command. One command will provide a URL that can be pasted into a browser and another command can have the initial token as a parameter.\r\n* [x] Go through mappings and fix obvious mistakes. I have a video here which is of the blocks in all three editions as a comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK2VGDQBQS0  and a plugin here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/debug-scanner.79077\r\n* [ ] After https://github.com/NukkitX/Protocol/pull/39 is merged add back the disabled github action\r\n* [ ] Backport map colors\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n* [x] Crafting anything does not yet work. \r\n  * [Working MCEE-MCEE proxypass](https://hastebin.com/raw/zanigovuyi)\r\n  * [Non working MCEE-Geyser proxypass](https://hastebin.com/latiquqejo.cs)\r\n* [ ] Creativing Internal Craft is allowed at the moment when it should show barriers\r\n* [ ] Pressing '/' on desktop MCEE sometimes crashes the client. This may be due to too many commands which can be disabled or perhaps its a bug.",

This allows overriding any resource at runtime by creating a file of the same name in \"resources/path/to/file\".\r\n\r\n* When loading mappings/blocks.json we also look for an overrides/blocks.json.

This PR also contains some more miscellaneous changes, such as the reintroduction of the chunk cache (by default disabled) for full support of these new features and changes.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does:\r\n- [x] Support for serverside sounds\r\n- [x] Support for particles and effects\r\n- [x] Block and entity interaction sounds (see [SoundInteractionHandler](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/blob/feature/sounds/connector/src/main/java/org/geysermc/connector/network/translators/sound/SoundInteractionHandler.java#L38)).\r\n  - [x] Block interaction sounds\r\n  - [x] Entity interaction sounds\r\n- Chunk caching\r\n- Miscellaneous refactors to package structure\r\n\r\nChunk caching was reintroduced to allow for full support for sounds and particles. This feature by default is disabled as it can eat up lots of RAM when there are many players online. In most instances if only one or two people are joining through Geyser at once, RAM should not be eaten up too much. However, having it disabled is not detrimental and only (at this point in time), causes break particles not to show up in creative and sounds not play for blocks with a break time of zero. **However**, if you're running Geyser on a Bukkit server (or any derivative), chunk caching is not used at all as Geyser has direct access to the server itself, so support for these particles are restored.\r\n\r\nFor those currently running Geyser on a proxy, it is highly advised if you want support for these particles that you migrate over to Geyser-Bukkit, and instead use a proxy supporting Minecraft: Bedrock Edition such as [Waterdog](https://github.com/yesdog/Waterdog).\r\n\r\nThough changes in this branch have been tested by many in Discord, this could still benefit from additional testing to help find more recent bugs or any non-mapped sounds that were previously missed.\r\n\r\n(Fixes #437)",

Whenever the server sent an EntityPropertiesPacket to update the player's movement speed, or an EntityMetadataPacket to update the player's sprinting state, the proxy would send the client a SetEntityDataPacket with the default EntityFlags, causing the client to stop sprinting and desync sneaking. Also, the movement speed attribute modifiers were not being calculated, so the client was reset to the default movement speed.",
