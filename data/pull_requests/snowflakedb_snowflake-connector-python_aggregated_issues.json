Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n   The main purpose of this change is to add tests that show that structured types work with iceberg tables and conversion to pandas. While implementing the tests I found a number of gaps in that functionality which I've either patched to add support, or opened relevant tickets to do so in the future.\r\n\r\n  Review Notes:\r\n\r\n- CArrowTableIterator.cpp\r\n  - I pulled most of the logic out from `reconstructRecordBatches_nanoarrow` into a new function `convertIfNeeded`. This allows me to call it recursively when parsing nested types. I've added logic to support ARRAY, MAP, and OBJECT to the switch in this function.\r\n  -  Most of the converters in this file have ben slightly modified to no longer rely on indexes, but to instead use pointers. This allows calling them from an arbirary nesting level when parsing structured types.\r\n  - There's a couple spots in the converters where I simplified the code slightly to make it more readable.\r\n- result_batch.py\r\n  - By default arrow would cast maps to something like `[('k1', 1), ('k2', 2)]` which is not the most intuitive thing to work with. pyspark would return `{'k1': 1, 'k2': 2}` which is a better form in my opinion. The parameter added in this file will default to the pyspark style return. This should not be a BCR because this feature is not publicly available yet.\r\n- test_arrow_result.py\r\n  - I've refactored the tests so that they parameterize on the matrix of [datatype, iceberg, pandas]. Each datatype is tested against FDN and iceberg tables and collected to either python objects or pandas dataframes.",

The easiest way I saw to do this was to refactor the `CArrowChunkIterator::initColumnConverters` method to extract most of the converter initialization logic into a public utility function. This function was then used in the new Converters in order to find the correct converter for child elements. I suspect this could also be useful for existing converters like `FixedSizeListConverter`, but I have not looked into it too much.\r\n\r\nMAP previously was not a supported type in the connector, but was on the DB side. This change adds the type to relevant type enums.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change I ran the files I touched through clang-format to try to adhere to the style of other Snowflake repos cpp code which may have added some extra noise here. Should we enable clang-format as a lint gate for this part of the code?\r\n",

      "The following is perhaps better formulated as an issue, but I thought I'd just share the following.\r\n\r\nI noticed that inside the `SnowflakeCursor` class, you [initialize lots of variables](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/aa5e50b9004ad38a3607a0e70dfd3445a501457c/src/snowflake/connector/cursor.py#L463) as `self.foo: SomeType | None = None`. For instance `self._result_set: ResultSet | None = None`.\r\n\r\n This pattern makes it very difficult for a type checker to work well, since whenever you do something like `self._result_set._fetch_pandas_all`, you get the type error `\"_fetch_pandas_all\" is not a known member of \"None\"`.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the best solution is to have different classes one for initialization and one for when you have a result - or have a ResultSet that can be empty. The other solution is to liberally use `assert self.foo is not None`, so that the type checker gets this. \r\n\r\nI considered adding a couple of `assert self._result_set is not None` when making this PR, but I decided not to, since doing so properly would mean a lot of assertions.",

      "The type signature came from me writing this in vscode with the pyright type checker.\r\n\r\nLooks like mypy and pyright have slightly different behaviour. pyright allows my usage, while mypy does not. Here is a version that satisfies both . I believe the return type of `None` when `Literal[False]` is provided, is correct. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Literal, overload, reveal_type, NewType\r\n\r\nTable = NewType(\"Table\", object)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    @overload\r\n    def fetch_arrow_all(self, force_return_table: Literal[False]) -> None:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    @overload\r\n    def fetch_arrow_all(self, force_return_table: Literal[True]) -> Table:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    def fetch_arrow_all(self, force_return_table: bool = False) -> Table | None:\r\n        return Table(1) if force_return_table else None\r\n\r\n\r\nfetch_true = Foo().fetch_arrow_all(True)\r\nfetch_false = Foo().fetch_arrow_all(False)\r\nreveal_type(fetch_true)  # Table\r\nreveal_type(fetch_false)  # None\r\n```",

I doubt this would work in MSVC, but I don't think anyone uses this mode with MSVC.\r\n   - There was a `ArrowDecimal` parsing codepath that seems to create a `shared_ptr` on a per-value basis.\r\n       - I switched this to use a stack-allocated object, which should be \"free\" to allocate.\r\n   - `ReturnVal` just contains 2 pointers, without any ownership over the pointers.\r\n       - I added a comment to reflect this, so it's more clear.\r\n       - The caller does not need to keep a reference to the returned value, so I removed the `cret` field from `PyArrowIterator`.\r\n       - The object has a small, fixed size, so it does not need to be a `shared_ptr`. I switched this to return-by-value in places where it's used.\r\n           - The pyx file didn't immediately work with this, since it tries to use the default constructor. I added a default constructor for it to use.\r\n   - When `NANOARROW_TYPE_ENUM_STRING` is defined in the header, anyone who doesn't use it has a compiler warning.\r\n       - I have moved the definition to the `.cpp` file to silence the warning.\r\n       - I also took this opportunity to move it into the `sf` namespace.\r\n   - I made the move constructor of `UniqueRef` non-explicit.\r\n       - This allows `UniqueRef` to be returned from functions by value. See [this compiler explorer link](https://godbolt.org/z/1j8Kde1dc) for an example.\r\n       - Note that [`std::unique_ptr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/unique_ptr) also has an implicit move constructor.\r\n   - I made `UniqueRef::reset()` safer.\r\n       - The documentation for [`Py_SETREF`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_SETREF) and [`Py_CLEAR`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_CLEAR) mention that if the `XDECREF` causes other code to run which calls into the object, then it might try to use the object that is being deleted, which may lead to issues.\r\n       - The new `UniqueRef::reset()` clears the reference before decrementing the refcount.\r\n           - Note that [`std::unique_ptr::reset()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/reset) also does these operations, in the same order.\r\n",

Users who use Snowpark in conjunction with the VS Code extension would benefit if the extension lets them use the node connector's connection that they've already authenticated with by logging in through the extension UI. Then when they execute Snowpark code, they wouldn't have to create another connection through the Python connector. \r\n\r\nTo get started with this flow, the Python connector needs to be able to accept a session and master token from another connection. \r\n\r\nI'm interested in starting some discussion around this via this PR. \r\n\r\n4. Considerations\r\n\r\n`update_tokens` takes some other parameters such as id_token and mfa_token. The Node connector's connection, when serialized, does not have that information. I tested with a trial Snowflake account with MFA enabled and I successfully logged in and reused the node connector connection in Python code. I'm not 100% clear on whether omitting these (id_token, mfa_token) could affect anything else. In connection.py's open_connection, by using the session and master token in update_tokens, I may be bypassing some validation that occurs in all the other authentication paths. Interested in learning more from the regular contributors to this repository. \r\n",

I'm very grateful for your code suggestions.\r\n\r\nI've incorporated them and updated the docstring with a bit more info and also overloaded the `_fetch_arrow_all` method. I'm unable to make the tests run locally, but I think it looks good.",

Pyarrow typing is pretty non-existant, but this would remove a lot of red error messages in the function definitions.\r\n\r\nI considered doing so in this PR, but decided to avoid scope creep 😅 ",

      "@sfc-gh-mkeller Please explain, because I just closed our incident with your intention to drop the urllib pin. As you mention urllib is a transient dependency of snowflake-connector-python. I understand that requests is a direct dependency for the OCSP code and cannot be removed (but unpinned).\r\n\r\nWhy are you therefore pinning urllib < 2? Is it only for asserting that a normal pip install snowflake-connector-python will not run into problems on Centos 7? Why don't you let the users pin urllib in their environment by themselves? The urllib documentation even mentions pinning to urllib < 2 in these cases.\r\n\r\n@pquentin Could you please comment on the best practices here?",
      "The best practice is definitely to let users pin in their environments. https://hynek.me/articles/semver-will-not-save-you/ covers that and mentions urllib3<2 even if it was published before we released 2.0.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you have many customers that rely on CentOS 7 or Amazon Linux 2 you can do like botocore and [only allow urllib3 2.0 on Python 3.10 and above](https://github.com/boto/botocore/pull/3034), as those versions of Python do not even compile without OpenSSL 1.1.1+, per https://peps.python.org/pep-0644/.",
      "@timostrunk It's because of our FIPS mode. If we allow `urllib3` 2.0.0+ then that won't work with `openssl 1.0.2-fips`. See [this test job](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/actions/runs/6751433356/job/18355776626?pr=1793).\r\n@pquentin brings up a good point though!",

Python 3.12 dropped\ndistutils, consequently supporting it required finding a replacement for\nthe setup.py/distutils based build system NumPy was using. We have\nchosen to use the Meson build system instead, and this is the first\nNumPy release supporting it. This is also the first release that\nsupports Cython 3.0 in addition to retaining 0.29.X compatibility.\nSupporting those two upgrades was a large project, over 100 files have\nbeen touched in this release. The changelog doesn't capture the full\nextent of the work, special thanks to Ralf Gommers, Sayed Adel, Stéfan\nvan der Walt, and Matti Picus who did much of the work in the main\ndevelopment branch.</p>\n<p>The highlights of this release are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 3.12.0 support.</li>\n<li>Cython 3.0.0 compatibility.</li>\n<li>Use of the Meson build system</li>\n<li>Updated SIMD support</li>\n<li>f2py fixes, meson and bind(x) support</li>\n<li>Support for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.9-3.12.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>Array API v2022.12 support in <code>numpy.array_api</code></h3>\n<p><code>numpy.array_api</code> now full supports the\n<a href=\"https://data-apis.org/array-api/2022.12\">v2022.12 version</a> of the array API standard.  Note that this does not\nyet include the optional <code>fft</code> extension in the standard.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23789\">gh-23789</a>)</p>\n<h3>Support for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library</h3>\n<p>Support for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library, including ILP64\n(64-bit integer) support, in macOS 13.3 has been added. This brings\narm64 support, and significant performance improvements of up to 10x for\ncommonly used linear algebra operations. When Accelerate is selected at\nbuild time, the 13.3+ version will automatically be used if available.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24053\">gh-24053</a>)</p>\n<h3><code>meson</code> backend for <code>f2py</code></h3>\n<p><code>f2py</code> in compile mode (i.e. <code>f2py -c</code>) now accepts the</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

The fix involves a new file format parameter \"use_logical_type\" for parquet files. When writing data that contains timezones, the parameter should be set to True. Write_pandas uses parquet files on the background, so support should be added for the newly added parameter \"use_logical_type\", such that write_pandas can correctly write dataframes with timezones.

This is passed directly to an ArrowIterator. The already existing retry mechanism does not catch this as no Exception is generated.\r\n\r\n   Please write a short description of how your code change solves the related issue.\r\n4. Setting enforce_content_length checks the length of the response and raises an IncompleteRead error, which should already trigger the existing retry mechanism.\r\nThis is the same behaviour as in urllib 3 V2.0. \r\n\r\nIn other words: #1689 is the better fix to this problem. I'm sending this PR to document the issue and maybe to provide a quickfix version for the interested parties.\r\n\r\nAlso some info: I should add that this is not confirmed to fix the issue yet. It's just my best guess. I also thought about actually not only overriding the default, but also enforcing enforce_content_length to true in the function itself. But I think requests is the only user in this case and it's also vendored and it never sets it explicitly, so I just overrode the default.\r\n",

      "Thanks @podung !\r\nI have the next week off, so I was planning to pick this up around the 21st of February when I am back to work. I will check when I come back if there have been any developments; if not, I will pick it up myself!",
      "> Thanks @podung ! I have the next week off, so I was planning to pick this up around the 21st of February when I am back to work. I will check when I come back if there have been any developments; if not, I will pick it up myself!\r\n\r\nGreat @raulbonet - I started the rebase last Thursday night and, as I assumed, there are quite a few conflicts to resolve, specifically in the test file since my PR incorporated some refactorings of tests for the mocking paradigm.  I was starting make headway and think I can complete the rebase and have it pushed up this week.\r\n\r\nI'll be sure to update here on my progress - but I won't be offended if someone beats me to it",
      "Hello @podung \r\nI am back from holidays! Unless I am told otherwise, I am going to pick this up tomorrow and assume there have not been any developments",
      "Hey @raulbonet \n\nI worked through a bit more of the rebase, but between life and work didn't get it done yet. \n\nI'll be on a plane tomorrow and can maybe finish that part. I think I was getting into a flow to figure out the upstream vs head changes.\n\nI would have liked to get my code in a better state for the community here, but I'm in no way offended if you take it and run with it.\n\nIf you do pick it up, let me know what path you plan to take (e.g. just redo the same conceptual changes, work through the rebase, etc). I'm cool with whatever you do.\n\nJoe",
      "I'm doing one last thing quick attempt to squash my commits then rebase. That way I don't have to keep re-fixing the conflicts on every applied commit on the new base.\n\nIf you can give me a few hours I think I can get you the rebased code. Then you can pick it up and see if anything else needs more work (excluding that in the windows environment, or anything else that requires changes since this has gone stale)\n\nSound good?",
      "Hello @podung \nThanks! I was already rebasing it myself but if you can do it, it would be great! Can you let me know once it's done?\n\nI did have a look at the merge conflicts and it seems that there is nothing conceptually different, so I was planning on following your approach and adjusting something if needed. ",

Can you let me know once it's done?\r\n> \r\n> I did have a look at the merge conflicts and it seems that there is nothing conceptually different, so I was planning on following your approach and adjusting something if needed.\r\n\r\nYep, it's not too bad, but the painful part is that I refactored some of that test file to mock the socket.select.  So the rebase is just painful.  I made good progress, but have a couple meetings to run to.\r\n\r\nI really don't want to hold you up, so if you cannot wait on me I do not mind if you plow forward.  But I'm absolutely willing to work through this rebase and I have a decent handle on the changes now",
      "Hello @podung \r\nYeah hehe, I saw it, it's interesting that in the end the most painful part to merge is the tests. I can re-arrange some work and start tomorrow with something else instead, to give you more time to do the rebase. Do you have an estimate on how long this is going to take on your end?",

I'll update end of day on status - hopefully it will be done",
      "@raulbonet \r\n\r\nWell... that was the most painful rebase conflict I've resolved in a long time.  Since I introduced using mock.patch in the test file, there were lots of indentation changes and git was thoroughly confused on how to align the changes.\r\n\r\nAfter a few false starts, I finally ended up squashing most of my commits.  Then I re-ordered the test file so all my newly introduced tests were at the very end of the file.  This greatly reduced the number of rebase conflicts I needed to fix.  I also broke out a separate commit for the test file refactors to help isolate all those whitespace changes independently.\r\n\r\nI have all of this currently in a new branch: https://github.com/podung/snowflake-connector-python/tree/robust_containerized_externalbrowser_rebased\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Two of my newly introduced tests are failing.  The way its failing makes me think the behavior might actually be broken.  I'm unable to get back into the right headspace and setup an environment to actually test out my changes and its behavior.\r\n\r\nHopefully this rebased branch aids in your effort to keep this moving forward.  Would you like to run with the test failures and to take it from here?  If I can help in any way or if you have any questions about the content, I'd be happy to try to provide context.  If I remember right, some of my coworkers had success with various combinations of the new flags, so ymmv.  I also see some changes called out in the changelog that make me wonder if other similar ideas have been explored, but I did not dive into any of it to be sure.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the github flow for getting a PR updated that was originally submitted by another user.  I left my original branch alone since the tests are passing there and I didn't want to force push and not have access to that.  If you figure out the broken tests and I want me to pull in your changes and push something to keep this PR moving just let me know.\r\n\r\nGood luck!",
      "Hello @podung \r\nThank you very much. I can't push to your branch and not sure if there is a way to maintain your original PR without giving me write access to your branch.\r\nAnyway, I created another PR [here](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/pull/1886)"

Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n   When I was helping ODBC team to debug their query context related issue. I found that both ODBC and python connector have an inconsistent query context JSON serialization behavior for HTTP response. To be precise:\r\n   \r\n   1. The json field name should be `queryContextDTO` instead of `queryContext` to keep consistent with JDBC/GS.\r\n   2. The entire `queryContextDTO` field is also not a string, it should be an object (dict in python).\r\n   3. The `context` subfield is not a string, but an `OpaqueContextDTO` object in JDBC, and this object contains a string field which is the context base64 encoded value. \r\n`JSON: {\"sqlText\":\"insert into t1 values (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)\",\"sequenceId\":10,\"bindings\":{},\"bindStage\":null,\"describeOnly\":false,\"parameters\":{\"NEW_SQL_FORMAT\":false,\"CLIENT_RESULT_CHUNK_SIZE\":96},\"queryContextDTO\":{\"entries\":[{\"id\":0,\"timestamp\":6645635168985,\"priority\":0,\"context\":{}}]},\"describedJobId\":\"01ad95f6-0000-0154-0000-0004011a4be2\",\"querySubmissionTime\":1689200068021,\"isInternal\":false,\"asyncExec\":false} `\r\n    for example, here when context is empty, the value is {}. for string type context, the empty context will be serialized to \"\". This could cause GS side unable to convert the JSON back to java query context object.\r\n    \r\n    \r\nFor references:\r\n1.

Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n   In this PR I hopefully fix the underlying issue causing `pickle.dump` segfaults.\r\n   The just of what I found is that calls calling `_save` did not hold `self._lock` which could lead to other threads modifying the data in the cache while dumping was going on and more issues were found later. I verified this with `assert` statements.\r\n    I also updated all the unsafe call places that I could find. I left in the assert statements for now to catch other unsafe calls.\r\n    I included a draw.io graph for how the different functions call each other, note that control flow goes left to right.\r\n    [SFDictCache control flow.drawio.zip](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/files/12089342/SFDictCache.control.flow.drawio.zip)\r\n",

Pass [--full-trace]{.title-ref} to see hidden and internal frames.&quot;.</p>\n<p>Previously, the last frame of the traceback was shown, even though it was hidden.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10940\">#10940</a>: Improved verbose output (<code>-vv</code>) of <code>skip</code> and <code>xfail</code> reasons by performing text wrapping while leaving a clear margin for progress output.</p>\n<p>Added <code>TerminalReporter.wrap_write()</code> as a helper for that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10991\">#10991</a>: Added handling of <code>%f</code> directive to print microseconds in log format options, such as <code>log-date-format</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11005\">#11005</a>: Added the underlying exception to the cache provider's path creation and write warning messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11013\">#11013</a>: Added warning when <code>testpaths</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;confval&quot;} is set, but paths are not found by glob. In this case, pytest will fall back to searching from the current directory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11043\">#11043</a>: When [--confcutdir]{.title-ref} is not specified, and there is no config file present, the conftest cutoff directory ([--confcutdir]{.title-ref}) is now set to the <code>rootdir &lt;rootdir&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;}.\nPreviously in such cases, [conftest.py]{.title-ref} files would be probed all the way to the root directory of the filesystem.\nIf you are badly affected by this change, consider adding an empty config file to your desired cutoff directory, or explicitly set [--confcutdir]{.title-ref}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11081\">#11081</a>: The <code>norecursedirs</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;confval&quot;} check is now performed in a <code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} implementation, so plugins can affect it.</p>\n<p>If after updating to this version you see that your [norecursedirs]{.title-ref} setting is not being respected,\nit means that a conftest or a plugin you use has a bad [pytest_ignore_collect]{.title-ref} implementation.\nMost likely, your hook returns [False]{.title-ref} for paths it does not want to ignore,\nwhich ends the processing and doesn't allow other plugins, including pytest itself, to ignore the path.\nThe fix is to return [None]{.title-ref} instead of [False]{.title-ref} for paths your hook doesn't want to ignore.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8711\">#8711</a>: <code>caplog.set_level() &lt;pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} and <code>caplog.at_level() &lt;pytest.LogCaptureFixture.at_level&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}\nwill temporarily enable the requested <code>level</code> if <code>level</code> was disabled globally via\n<code>logging.disable(LEVEL)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Fill out the following pre-review checklist:\r\n\r\n   - [x] I am adding a new automated test(s) to verify correctness of my new code\r\n   - [ ] I am adding new logging messages\r\n   - [ ] I am adding a new telemetry message\r\n   - [ ] I am modifying authorization mechanisms\r\n   - [ ] I am adding new credentials\r\n   - [ ] I am modifying OCSP code\r\n   - [ ] I am adding a new dependency\r\n\r\n3. Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n   We discovered a bug where `appname` and possibly `version` was being appended to `SNOWFLAKE_HOME`.\r\n   What this lead to is that configuration file location would become `/Users/mkeller/.snowflake/snowflake/config.toml` when `~/.snowflake` existed.\r\n   \r\n   In this PR I remove appending these pieces to the path and update the accompanying unit tests. I guess I knew this when I wrote this code, but it never occurred to me that this was not what we wanted",

There has also been work to prepare for the\nfuture NumPy 2.0.0 release, resulting in a large number of new and\nexpired deprecation. Highlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for MUSL, there are now MUSL wheels.</li>\n<li>Support the Fujitsu C/C++ compiler.</li>\n<li>Object arrays are now supported in einsum</li>\n<li>Support for inplace matrix multiplication (<code>@=</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will be releasing a NumPy 1.26 when Python 3.12 comes out. That is\nneeded because distutils has been dropped by Python 3.12 and we will be\nswitching to using meson for future builds. The next mainline release\nwill be NumPy 2.0.0. We plan that the 2.0 series will still support\ndownstream projects built against earlier versions of NumPy.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.9-3.11.</p>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>np.core.MachAr</code> is deprecated.

My inspiration came from CLI libraries, by supplying a env variable name it can grab values from there. I wanted to expand that and to me this is the most important part of this class. As an example: if down the line we decide to support listening on port `8082` for configuration changes on the fly, we have a way to implement that now.\r\nSecondly `ConfiigParser` never really did any parsing. So I'd say that the original name was misleading."

This behavior was deprecated in May 2000 in RFC 2818. Instead only <code>subjectAltName</code> is used to verify the hostname by default. To enable verifying the hostname against <code>commonName</code> use <code>SSLContext.hostname_checks_common_name = True</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2113\">#2113</a>).</li>\n<li>Removed support for Python with an <code>ssl</code> module compiled with LibreSSL, CiscoSSL, wolfSSL, and all other OpenSSL alternatives.

Using this parameter will set the header <code>Content-Type: application/json</code> if <code>Content-Type</code> isn't already defined. Added support for parsing JSON response bodies with <code>HTTPResponse.json()</code> method (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2243\">#2243</a>).</li>\n<li>Added type hints to the <code>urllib3</code> module (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1897\">#1897</a>).</li>\n<li>Added <code>ssl_minimum_version</code> and <code>ssl_maximum_version</code> options which set <code>SSLContext.minimum_version</code> and <code>SSLContext.maximum_version</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2110\">#2110</a>).</li>\n<li>Added support for Zstandard (RFC 8878) when <code>zstandard</code> 1.18.0 or later is installed.

But if <code>combine=True</code> is passed into a call to <code>HTTPHeaderDict.add</code>, then the added header value will be merged in with an existing value into a comma-separated list (<code>X-My-Header: foo, bar</code>) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2242\">#2242</a>).</li>\n<li>Added <code>NameResolutionError</code> exception when a DNS error occurs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2305\">#2305</a>).</li>\n<li>Added <code>proxy_assert_hostname</code> and <code>proxy_assert_fingerprint</code> kwargs to <code>ProxyManager</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2409\">#2409</a>).</li>\n<li>Added a configurable <code>backoff_max</code> parameter to the <code>Retry</code> class.

Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n   As stated in the JDBC PR side https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/pull/1366\r\n   \r\n   Consider a simple situation :\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurrent state:\r\n<id, priority, timestamp, context>\r\n<1, 1, 1, None>\r\n<2,2,2, None>\r\nincoming changes:\r\n\r\nmerge <1, 2,1, None> \r\n   call remove QCE(<1,1,1, None>) -> remove priorityMap(1, <1,1,1, None>)\r\n   call add QCE(<1,2,1, None>) -> add priorityMap(2, <1,2,1, None>) this map insertion will fail due to collision of priority key(there are two priority keys of 2)\r\nmerge <2,1,1, None>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough this bug does not affect the contents in treeSet in this simple example (this is also why I thought I fixed the issue before, I only checked the final QCC entries embedded into the HTTP request, and found the previous multi-db missing query context issue was gone. However, the priorityMap contents are not correctly maintained), it can trigger inconsistent QCC treeSet and priorityMap contents in following rounds.\r\n\r\nI also find another bug in python implementation:\r\n\r\nBasically, in my end-to-end test, when I want to\r\n```\r\ndef _remove_qce(self, qce: QueryContextElement) -> None:\r\n        self._id_map.pop(qce.id)\r\n        self._priority_map.pop(qce.priority)\r\n        self._tree_set.remove(qce)\r\n```\r\neven if there is an element in tree_set with all the same field values(id, ts, priority, context), the remove API can not find the entry to remove. I checked the _hash_  values are the same. If i do\r\n```\r\nfor ele in self._tree_set:\r\n   if(ele.__eq__(qce)):\r\n       self._tree_set.remove(ele)\r\n```\r\nThis can work. \r\n\r\nThis reason could be that the python QueryContextElement object in \r\n```\r\n        self._id_map: dict[int, QueryContextElement] = {}\r\n        self._priority_map: dict[int, QueryContextElement] = {}\r\n        self._tree_set: set[QueryContextElement] = SortedSet()\r\n```\r\nare referencing the same underlying object. I use `copy.deepcopy` when adding a QCE to each map/set to avoid this tricky bug. In this way, we also can not do in-place update in `merge` function. The overhead should be very small since the QCC capacity is usually a small number. If you have any better solution, please let me know.\r\n",

      "Hi @sfc-gh-sfan and @sfc-gh-aalam , could you take a final round on the current changes? I will submit another PR to fix the `merge` issue. When dealing with multi-database query, and the query context priority of each database might change, and the current implementation could fail to `merge` entries due to the priority switch.\r\n\r\nFor example, Entry A priority 1->2, B 2->1, when replace old A with new A, the `priority_map` add(2, new A) will fail due to duplicate priority key `2`, and this will make the entire `merge` functionality broken. \r\n\r\nI think a simple fix is to use a nest dict for priority_map, when there is priority key duplication, we use id as key. I will push the PR later. This way, I do not need to modify the logic within `merge` itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      "Hello @hosimesi , thank you submitting a PR to address this issue. I looked at the historical changes, you are right about the cause. For versions before `2.4.1`, we pass `kwargs` to [pyArrow.Table.to_pandas](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Table.html#pyarrow.Table.to_pandas), but when we introduced parallel fetch in #787 , `_fetch_pandas_all` mistakenly passes `kwargs` to pandas.concat` instead. \r\nTo be fully honest, I'm not sure what the best thing to do is here because neither of these are documented behaviors and therefore should not be relied on. I'm leaning towards accepting your change and restore the old behavior, but I will have to discuss this with the other maintainers before making the final decision.\r\nMeanwhile, please feel free to sign the CLA and mark the PR as review ready.

Ran [autotyping](https://github.com/JelleZijlstra/autotyping) to generate some type-hints\r\n   2. Ran a modified version of [PyAnnotate](https://github.com/dropbox/pyannotate) to generate type-hints\r\n   3. Ran `pre-commit autoupdate` and updated some settings that I now know were useless (e.g.: excluding files that were never part of VC)\r\n   4. I removed `snowflake.connector.mixin` as it seems to have never been used. I also checked the [DBAPI2 spec](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/) and this seems to NOT be part of the spec. However; I'm not against reverting this change.\r\n   5. I added `mypy` to our pre-commit config to be run on some of our files. While I fixed a lot of other typing issues, doing more than this subset will take a while and as we have agreed it'd be better to get started with some verification rather than delay this even longer.",

Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n Local builds on MacOS are failing because the PyArrow upgrade we merged last week requires MacOS SDK to have version > 10.13.  However, `build`/`pip` is building the wheel against a [platform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.get_platform) potentially different than the operating system's [platform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#platform.platform). I.e. if your Python distribution (via downloaded installer) is built with MacOSX10.9 SDK, `build`/`pip` will try to build the wheel using that regardless of your machine's current OS.\r\nThis fix attempts to address this problem by specifying a minimum version of gcc's Mac OS X deployment target to be `10.13` in `setup.py`.\r\n**Reference**: https://github.com/pypa/wheel/blob/8dfef1355a8f19e773a08630613bd2da6c636c37/src/wheel/bdist_wheel.py#L274\r\n",

I think this is a big problem, the client should not overwrite any environment variable, this has caused a bunch of very hard to debug problems for me at work. Since snowflake uses the vendored requests library to send the query requests, why not just pass in the proxies to that instead of changing the environment variables? If there is a strong reason for changing the variables, I think we should do something like this:\r\n   \r\n```python\r\n@contextlib.contextmanager\r\ndef set_proxy_env_vars(proxy: str) -> Generator[Any, Any, None]:\r\n    proxy_env_vars = {\"HTTP_PROXY\": None, \"HTTPS_PROXY\": None}\r\n    for env in proxy_env_vars:\r\n        proxy_env_vars[env] = os.environ.get(env)\r\n        os.environ[env] = proxy\r\n    yield\r\n    for env, val in proxy_env_vars.items():\r\n        os.environ[env] = val\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will change the environment variables only for the scope of the contextmanager and revert the variables back to their original values.",

Which might be still bad enough of course.\r\n\r\n**edit**: adding an existing proxy (listening on http) to the test shows that the connector installed from the PR correctly passes the request to the proxy without changing the envvar value",

There are also a large number of new and\nexpired deprecations due to changes in promotion and cleanups. This\nmight be called a deprecation release. Highlights are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many new deprecations, check them out.</li>\n<li>Many expired deprecations,</li>\n<li>New F2PY features and fixes.</li>\n<li>New &quot;dtype&quot; and &quot;casting&quot; keywords for stacking functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See below for the details,</p>\n<p>This release supports Python versions 3.8-3.11.</p>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<h3>Deprecate fastCopyAndTranspose and PyArray_CopyAndTranspose</h3>\n<p>The <code>numpy.fastCopyAndTranspose</code> function has been deprecated. Use the\ncorresponding copy and transpose methods directly:</p>\n<pre><code>arr.T.copy()\n</code></pre>\n<p>The underlying C function <code>PyArray_CopyAndTranspose</code> has also been\ndeprecated from the NumPy C-API.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22313\">gh-22313</a>)</p>\n<h3>Conversion of out-of-bound Python integers</h3>\n<p>Attempting a conversion from a Python integer to a NumPy value will now\nalways check whether the result can be represented by NumPy. This means\nthe following examples will fail in the future and give a\n<code>DeprecationWarning</code> now:</p>\n<pre><code>np.uint8(-1)\nnp.array([3000], dtype=np.int8)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many of these did succeed before. Such code was mainly useful for\nunsigned integers with negative values such as <code>np.uint8(-1)</code> giving\n<code>np.iinfo(np.uint8).max</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that conversion between NumPy integers is unaffected, so that\n<code>np.array(-1).astype(np.uint8)</code> continues to work and use C integer\noverflow logic. For negative values, it will also work to view the\narray: <code>np.array(-1, dtype=np.int8).view(np.uint8)</code>. In some cases,</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

      "> The code presented here seems to targetting VARIANT data which is JSON-encoded; or is Snowflake implicitly converting other semi-structured formats to JSON? I wouldn't think so.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I follow. Snowflake encodes things in its internal format and doesn't preserve the source format.",
      "@cpcloud in this changeset, I read code such as:\r\n```python\r\ndef _VARIANT_to_python(self, _) -> Callable[[str], Any]:\r\n    \"\"\"Use a custom json decoder (accepts undefined) to load row value\"\"\"\r\n    return partial(json.loads, cls=SnowflakeJSONDecoder)\r\n```\r\nLike, we see a VARIANT value, let's decode it using JSON. But is that the only \"wire format\" we can get? I'm thinking both in terms of performance but also fidelity – JSON doesn't have the same data type richness as the other supported semi-structured formats.",
      "The fact that the arrow interop code [here](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/pull/1379/files#diff-83292202803defc0126ad4e03e1710d98226bd106de5e2a40d6ad9f73cb6ea45R52) is pulling out a string and then immediately decoding it as JSON suggests that variants are always coming back as JSON.\r\n\r\nI'd love to be wrong about this, other wire formats would be most welcome from the ibis perspective.",

If there's no specific reason, then we could unpin it.\r\n\r\nhowever, I'm still not sure about the root cause, maybe it's as you said -- the ocsp responder has changed the hash algorithm, which is not supported by the older version cryptograph.\r\n",

If you need other <code>py.*</code> modules, continue to install the deprecated <code>py</code> library separately, otherwise it can usually be removed as a dependency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4562\">#4562</a>: Deprecate configuring hook specs/impls using attributes/marks.</p>\n<p>Instead use :py<code>pytest.hookimpl</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} and :py<code>pytest.hookspec</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}.\nFor more details, see the <code>docs &lt;legacy-path-hooks-deprecated&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9886\">#9886</a>: The functionality for running tests written for <code>nose</code> has been officially deprecated.</p>\n<p>This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plain <code>setup</code> and <code>teardown</code> functions and methods: this might catch users by surprise, as <code>setup()</code> and <code>teardown()</code> are not pytest idioms, but part of the <code>nose</code> support.</li>\n<li>Setup/teardown using the <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/HEAD/with-setup-nose\"><code>@​with_setup</code></a> decorator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details, consult the <code>deprecation docs &lt;nose-deprecation&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9897\">#9897</a>: Added shell-style wildcard support to <code>testpaths</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10218\">#10218</a>: <code>@pytest.mark.parametrize()</code> (and similar functions) now accepts any <code>Sequence[str]</code> for the argument names,\ninstead of just <code>list[str]</code> and <code>tuple[str, ...]</code>.</p>\n<p>(Note that <code>str</code>, which is itself a <code>Sequence[str]</code>, is still treated as a\ncomma-delimited name list, as before).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10381\">#10381</a>: The <code>--no-showlocals</code> flag has been added.

This prevents a common mistake among beginners that expect that returning a [bool]{.title-ref} (for example [return foo(a, b) == result]{.title-ref}) would cause a test to pass or fail, instead of using [assert]{.title-ref}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8508\">#8508</a>: Introduce multiline display for warning matching via :py<code>pytest.warns</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} and\nenhance match comparison for :py<code>_pytest._code.ExceptionInfo.match</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} as returned by :py<code>pytest.raises</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8646\">#8646</a>: Improve :py<code>pytest.raises</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}.

But this is ok for us. We implemented in Airflow the whole modification of our pipeline so tha twe can disable selectively providers per version - so we can release Airlfow in 3.11 -compliant version without the possibilty of running Snowflkae (Snowflake provider will be < 3.11. So this does not block us, it's more that eager users will not be able to use Snowflake. Not a big problem for us, but it's good to keep that issue open, so that whenever snwflake is ready, we can re-enable 3.11 for it.",
      "Agreed, should wait for all upstream to be fully supported until official support. Maybe once they are supported, until there is full support for wheels in this package there could be notes about how to build it? I think it'll throw an error about wheels otherwise if you are on 3.11.",

Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n   When submitting a multi-statement query, GS returns a payload in which `resultIds` corresponding to each of the individual queries are provided. Even if the parameter (account, session, or statement level) `MULTI_STATEMENT_COUNT` is not 1 (other options allow multi-statement results), GS will still return the regular payload without `resultIds`, allowing the connector to determine whether the query submitted was multi-statement or not after inspecting the payload. I added several data members to the `cursor` class allowing the storage and retrieval of submitted query IDs. The `exec_async` functionality will also work the same way as it does for single statements (users are expected to call `get_results_by_sfqid` when they want to retrieve results of an asynchronous multi-statement query. Using the stored query IDs and the `query_result` method, the connector can set the cursor to achieve the same ready state for calling `fetch*()` after calling `nextset()` to iterate through the result sets of each query in the submitted multi-statement.\r\n",

It shouldn't be affected by your changes.\r\n2. Glad you're able to resolve it on your own 👍  Parsing these queries is tricky, again I think it's completely fine if we only test one query for each of `table`, `stage` and `file format`. For example, we could only test creation, because if `copy into`, `select` don't specify the same location, it should result in failure in other tests. ",

Normally this would be merged right away, but since the bug fix is technically a behavior change, it can only be merged into to `main` in the Python connector's next release in January 2023.

If pandas is used `pkg_resources` will get imported and no time will be saved there and if file transfer is used the time to import file transfer module will be paid on the first usage instead of the import time.",

Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\nSQLAlchemy's batch delete and update operations (in ORM) return\r\nrowcount of those operations after it closes the cursor. This\r\nfails to work with Snowflake engine and returns None because we\r\nare erasing the last known rowcount when the cursor is closed.\r\n\r\nMore information on the issue can be read on the original issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-sqlalchemy/issues/244\r\n\r\nIn comparison the SQLite DB-API implementation does not remove\r\nthe rowcount information after the cursor is closed. Since the\r\ncursor is not expected to be reusable after closure anyway this\r\nappears safe to do.\r\n\r\nThis change preserves the existing behavior of the internal\r\ncursor.reset() method that is responsible for removing the\r\nrowcount information during close, but specializes the behavior\r\nwhen the reset is performed in context of the cursor closing.\r\n\r\nThis approach preserves the existing use of cursor.reset() over\r\nopen cursors while also fixing the behavior for SQLAlchemy's use.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\n  - Unit tests added for the reset and close methods of Cursor\r\n  - Ran existing tests via `tox -e 'py37'` and verified no failures\r\n     occurred due to rowcount related values\r\n  - (Manual) Re-tested SQLAlchemy with the modified connector\r\n    and verified it returns the valid rowcount for delete and\r\n    update calls.",

Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n  \tAs part of the [SDKless rewrite](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/pull/725) it seems like we uninstentionally changed behavior of uploading files. Unless you create an external unencrypted stage we always encrypt a file that the client uploads and before rewrite [it used to be that upload size was set to the file before encryption](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/498e84c974a74072f899e6e5416a0317fee9d2f7/src/snowflake/connector/file_transfer_agent.py#L629), but in the rewrite we changed it so that the upload size was the true upload size. Encrypted files are 16B padded, [source](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/498e84c974a74072f899e6e5416a0317fee9d2f7/src/snowflake/connector/encryption_util.py#L108).\r\n  \tThis is why in this ticket the empty file's size became 16B instead of 0.\r\n",

Fill out the following pre-review checklist:\r\n\r\n   - [x] I am adding a new automated test(s) to verify correctness of my new code\r\n   - [x] I am adding new logging messages\r\n   - [ ] I am modifying authorization mechanisms\r\n   - [ ] I am adding new credentials\r\n   - [ ] I am modifying OCSP code\r\n   - [x] I am adding a new dependency\r\n\r\n3. Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n   In this PR I add an extension of #1195 that adds file caching on top of in-memory caches.\r\n   \r\n   ## On disk save strategy:\r\n   On every write to the in-memory cache (`__setitem__`, `update`) we generate a random number 0-9 and if it's 1 then we save to disk. This is done so if multi-processing starts multiple connectors with no cache available we distribute their writes randomly. The only other time we try to save is during tear-down.\r\n   One caveat of save is that we try to acquire the [file-lock](https://py-filelock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#filelock.FileLock) (which is required to be able to write to the cache file) in a non-blocking manner and if we don't succeed we log this and give up. So if a rogue process held the file lock forever then no file caching would be done.\r\n   However; after taking a look at how `filelock` is implemented this is unlikely to happen. It uses OS APIs to lock file parts to file descriptors, so if a connector held the file lock and it was SIGABORTED out of existence the OS would still clean up the open file descriptors and release those file parts. So someone would really have to hold the filelock maliciously for file caching to not work at all.\r\n   I think this is acceptable for caches.\r\n   \r\n   ## On disk load strategy:\r\n   On every miss and expiration we check whether the cache file has been modified since we last loaded it. If yes, then we load and try to turn that frown upside down!",

The highlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation of <code>loadtxt</code> in C, greatly improving its performance.</li>\n<li>Exposing DLPack at the Python level for easy data exchange.</li>\n<li>Changes to the promotion and comparisons of structured dtypes.</li>\n<li>Improvements to f2py.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See below for the details,</p>\n<h2>New functions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A masked array specialization of <code>ndenumerate</code> is now available as\n<code>numpy.ma.ndenumerate</code>. It provides an alternative to\n<code>numpy.ndenumerate</code> and skips masked values by default.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20020\">gh-20020</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>numpy.from_dlpack</code> has been added to allow easy exchange of data\nusing the DLPack protocol. It accepts Python objects that implement\nthe <code>__dlpack__</code> and <code>__dlpack_device__</code> methods and returns a\nndarray object which is generally the view of the data of the input\nobject.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21145\">gh-21145</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Setting <code>__array_finalize__</code> to <code>None</code> is deprecated. It must now be\na method and may wish to call <code>super().__array_finalize__(obj)</code>\nafter checking for <code>None</code> or if the NumPy version is sufficiently\nnew.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20766\">gh-20766</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using <code>axis=32</code> (<code>axis=np.MAXDIMS</code>) in many cases had the same\nmeaning as <code>axis=None</code>. This is deprecated and <code>axis=None</code> must be\nused instead.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20920\">gh-20920</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The hook function <code>PyDataMem_SetEventHook</code> has been deprecated and\nthe demonstration of its use in tool/allocation_tracking has been\nremoved. The ability to track allocations is now built-in to python\nvia <code>tracemalloc</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

      "Hi @sfc-gh-mkeller . I noticed that the `snowflake-connector-python` package in conda forge is built against (or works with) different versions of pyarrow (currently from version 4 to 7).\r\n\r\nThis branch doesn't build with Arrow versions < 8 because of the change in `arrow_iterator.pyx`, but one way that would allow building the connector for Arrow 4-8 would be this (see diff below). I think some further changes would still be needed to select the arrow library version to link with at build time, and maybe this would require changes in the conda forge recipe too. What do you think? Hopefully this is helpful.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/setup.py b/setup.py\r\nindex 8f64fcf..0b8f59e 100644\r\n--- a/setup.py\r\n+++ b/setup.py\r\n@@ -54,6 +54,7 @@ except ImportError:\r\n\r\n if _ABLE_TO_COMPILE_EXTENSIONS:\r\n\r\n+    pyarrow_version = tuple(int(x) for x in pyarrow.__version__.split(\".\"))\r\n     extensions = cythonize(\r\n         [\r\n             Extension(\r\n@@ -61,6 +62,7 @@ if _ABLE_TO_COMPILE_EXTENSIONS:\r\n                 sources=[os.path.join(CONNECTOR_SRC_DIR, \"arrow_iterator.pyx\")],\r\n             ),\r\n         ],\r\n+        compile_time_env=dict(ARROW_LESS_THAN_8=pyarrow_version < (8,))\r\n     )\r\n\r\n     class MyBuildExt(build_ext):\r\ndiff --git a/src/snowflake/connector/arrow_iterator.pyx b/src/snowflake/connector/arrow_iterator.pyx\r\nindex 5bea793..5356633 100644\r\n--- a/src/snowflake/connector/arrow_iterator.pyx\r\n+++ b/src/snowflake/connector/arrow_iterator.pyx\r\n@@ -22,7 +22,10 @@ from pyarrow.includes.libarrow cimport (\r\n     Readable,\r\n     Seekable,\r\n )\r\n-from pyarrow.includes.libarrow_python cimport PyReadableFile\r\n+IF ARROW_LESS_THAN_8:\r\n+    from pyarrow.includes.libarrow cimport PyReadableFile\r\n+ELSE:\r\n+    from pyarrow.includes.libarrow_python cimport PyReadableFile\r\n\r\n from .constants import IterUnit\r\n from .errorcode import (\r\n```",

      "@sfc-gh-kwagner @sfc-gh-mkeller I created a fixture to be reused by both tests. Let me know if that looks good.",
      "@sfc-gh-zblackwood  I'm not convinced that a fixture is the right choice the way things are. The current implementation (maintaining a list of requests) suggests that you'd like this to be reused by other tests, but there's no way to customize the responses it returns. Therefore I don't think that it'd be useful for any other tests.\r\n\r\nI do think that having a fixture like this would be useful for other unit tests though. Could we make the responses customizable? It'd be like our own [VCR.py](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy)\r\n\r\nedit: if we do the more general implementation then it should be moved the `test/conftest.py`",
      "@sfc-gh-mkeller The reason I converted this to a fixture is because it is being used in two different tests, not because I necessarily wanted to build a broadly-useful generic fixture (though I agree that something like VCR.py would be super useful). I'm not sure I know enough about this codebase to make a broadly generic fixture, but I believe these tests are appropriate for what they are testing. I changed the request_body to simply be a dictionary to make the tests more clear.",

Those timestamps have no sub-second parts.\r\n\r\nI apologize, some of things I talked about are not related to the actual issue.\r\n\r\nIt does look like [arrow supports nano second timestamps](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/timestamps.html), but it doesn't require it.\r\nIn the case you posted I believe that since there is no nanosecond precision needed your example timestamp should fit into a `pyarrow.Table`. Please see:\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> import datetime\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> timestamps = [datetime.datetime(1400, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3), datetime.datetime(9999, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3)]\r\n>>> pa.array(timestamps, type=pa.timestamp('s'))\r\n<pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at 0x10f15fac0>\r\n[\r\n  1400-01-01 01:02:03,\r\n  9999-01-01 01:02:03\r\n]\r\n>>> pa.array(timestamps, type=pa.timestamp('ms'))\r\n<pyarrow.lib.TimestampArray object at 0x10f15fb20>\r\n[\r\n  1400-01-01 01:02:03.000,\r\n  9999-01-01 01:02:03.000\r\n]\r\n>>> pa.array(timestamps, type=pa.timestamp('ns'))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 315, in pyarrow.lib.array\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 39, in pyarrow.lib._sequence_to_array\r\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 143, in pyarrow.lib.pyarrow_internal_check_status\r\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 99, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert datetime.datetime(1400, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3) with type datetime.datetime: out of bounds for nanosecond resolution\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world we should handle these cases instead of just preventing overflows.\r\n\r\n> In my opinion gracefully handle overflows is better than having problems with dates comparison when '9999-12-31' becomes less than a '1400-01-01' after converting to pyarrow.\r\n\r\nWe're in total agreement here. But your change is a breaking change already, so we'd need to pre-announce it and allow some time for all users to learn of this change before we actually release it. I would like to fully flush out our solution before we change anything.\r\n\r\nSince `pyarrow` supports more than microsecond precision what was done in #1030 is not a full solution to this issue, but what was done in it should get us most of the way there still.",
      "I'm sorry I still don't understand what is the proposal to fix this.\r\n\r\n> It does look like [arrow supports nano second timestamps](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/timestamps.html), but it doesn't require it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure who/what is **it** that does not require nano precision timestamps.\r\n\r\n[Snowflake timestamp](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-datetime.html#timestamp) the default precision is 9 (nanoseconds). `cursor.fetch_arrow_all()` should fetch the timestamp into nano precision pyarrow column. the types conversion is here: https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/main/src/snowflake/connector/result_batch.py#L665\r\n\r\nSo back to the problem: `1400-01-01` snowflake timestamp can not be fit into int64 - pyarrow.timestamp('ns') column which is used by pyarrow for nano precision timestamps.\r\n\r\n> In an ideal world we should handle these cases instead of just preventing overflows.\r\n\r\n> I would like to fully flush out our solution before we change anything.\r\n\r\nSo the question is what to expect:\r\n- Option 1: pyarrow.timestamp('ns') handles dates like `1400-01-01` or `9999-21-31` but how???\r\n- Option 2: Clip values to the max/min int64 values `1400-01-01` becomes `1677-09-21`\r\n- Option 3: leave overflows in the code `1400-01-01` becomes `1984-07-22`\r\n- Option 4: Change the pyarrow timestamp column to timestamp('ms') default and document that fetch_arrow_all() does not support nanoseconds, precision nanoseconds will be converted to milliseconds (but this is even bigger breaking change...)\r\n- Other options??",
      "> I'm not sure who/what is it that does not require nano precision timestamps.\r\n\r\nArrow doesn't. In my last comment I posted some code that shows that your timestamps do actually fit into a `pyarrow.Table` if you don't use nanosecond precision.\r\nI personally think that Snowflake's back-end should be smart enough to to realize that your timestamps don't need nanosecond precision and it should serve them at second precision and therefore we should be able to fit them into a `pyarrow.Table`. To verify this we'll need to talk to our back-end team.\r\n\r\n> Option 1: pyarrow.timestamp('ns') handles dates like 1400-01-01 or 9999-21-31 but how???\r\n\r\nThis isn't an option, you were right. I just didn't understand the issue previously.\r\n\r\n> Option 2: Clip values to the max/min int64 values 1400-01-01 becomes 1677-09-21\r\n\r\nI think we should be raising errors in the cases that you have identified (just like arrow does in my last comment).\r\n\r\nIf I was a Snowflake customer and I was fetching `1400-01-01 01:02:03.999999999` I'd expect it to show up as exactly as that, I'd say that any other result would be an error from my perspective. Now we can absolutely make this configurable, it sounds like you would rather have it snap to the smallest/largest timestamps instead and we should allow you to do that.\r\n\r\nHowever; by default I say we should be raising an error for each of these timestamps.\r\n\r\n> Option 3: leave overflows in the code 1400-01-01 becomes 1984-07-22\r\n\r\nWe both agree that this is not an option\r\n\r\n> Option 4: Change the pyarrow timestamp column to timestamp('ms') default and document that fetch_arrow_all() does not support nanoseconds, precision nanoseconds will be converted to milliseconds (but this is even bigger breaking change...)\r\n\r\nI don't think this would solve anything. It'd just make the default case less likely to error.",
      "Thanks for the detailed answers, that makes total sense to me. Throwing an error identifying that the 'ns' precision timestamp can not be fit makes sense.\r\n\r\nCouple more comments to add here:\r\n- we're using Exasol (turboodbc+exasol odbc) and `fetchallarrow` clips the timestamps to min/max possible values. That's why the initial proposal was to go with this option to match existing turboodbc.fetchallarrow behaviour with Exasol.\r\n- The default snowflake timestamp is nano precision, of course it's not needed everywhere and it's easy to fix changing the type to microseconds seconds. In some cases it requires casting to 'us' (::timestamp(6)) in SQL or schema change. (The synthetic example is just to illustrate the issue).\r\n\r\nI'd leave the decision to maintainers. We'll be able to adjust our codebase/schema as needed.",

These methods were originally\n  deprecated in version 2.0, but had an extended deprecation timeline due\n  to usage. Any remaining users should transition to ``sign`` and ``verify``.\n* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.1.0 support. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is no longer supported by\n  the OpenSSL project. The next release of ``cryptography`` will be the last\n  to support compiling with OpenSSL 1.1.0.\n* Deprecated Python 3.6 support. Python 3.6 is no longer supported by the\n  Python core team. Support for Python 3.6 will be removed in a future\n  ``cryptography`` release.\n* Deprecated the current minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) of 1.41.0.\n  In the next release we will raise MSRV to 1.48.0. Users with the latest\n  ``pip`` will typically get a wheel and not need Rust installed, but check\n  :doc:`/installation` for documentation on installing a newer ``rustc`` if\n  required.\n* Deprecated\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.CAST5`,\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.SEED`,\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.IDEA`, and\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.Blowfish` because\n  they are legacy algorithms with extremely low usage. These will be removed\n  in a future version of ``cryptography``.\n* Added limited support for distinguished names containing a bit string.\n* We now ship ``universal2`` wheels on macOS, which contain both ``arm64``\n  and ``x86_64`` architectures. Users on macOS should upgrade to the latest\n  ``pip`` to ensure they can use this wheel, although we will continue to\n  ship ``x86_64`` specific wheels for now to ease the transition.\n* This will be the final release for which we ship ``manylinux2010`` wheels.\n  Going forward the minimum supported ``manylinux`` ABI for our wheels will\n  be ``manylinux2014``. The vast majority of users will continue to receive\n  ``manylinux`` wheels provided they have an up to date ``pip``. For PyPy\n  wheels this release already requires ``manylinux2014`` for compatibility\n  with binaries distributed by upstream.\n* Added support for multiple\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPSingleResponse` in a\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse`.\n* Restored support for signing certificates and other structures in\n  :doc:`/x509/index` with SHA3 hash algorithms.\n* :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.TripleDES` is\n  disabled in FIPS mode.\n* Added support for serialization of PKCS#12 CA friendly names/aliases in\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates`\n* Added support for 12-15 byte (96 to 120 bit) nonces to\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESOCB3`.

See\n<code>uncooperative-constructors-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n<p>Note that a deprection warning is only emitted when there is a conflict in the\narguments pytest expected to pass.

These functions had an\n  extended deprecation due to usage, however the next version of\n  ``cryptography`` will drop support. Users should migrate to ``sign`` and\n  ``verify``.\n* The entire :doc:`/x509/index` layer is now written in Rust. This allows\n  alternate asymmetric key implementations that can support cloud key\n  management services or hardware security modules provided they implement\n  the necessary interface (for example:\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey`).\n* :ref:`Deprecated the backend argument&lt;faq-missing-backend&gt;` for all\n  functions.\n* Added support for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESOCB3`.\n* Added support for iterating over arbitrary request\n  :attr:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest.attributes`.\n* Deprecated the ``get_attribute_for_oid`` method on\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest` in favor of\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Attributes.get_attribute_for_oid` on the new\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.Attributes` object.\n* Fixed handling of PEM files to allow loading when certificate and key are\n  in the same file.\n* Fixed parsing of :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificatePolicies` extensions\n  containing legacy ``BMPString`` values in their ``explicitText``.\n* Allow parsing of negative serial numbers in certificates. Negative serial\n  numbers are prohibited by :rfc:`5280` so a deprecation warning will be\n  raised whenever they are encountered. A future version of ``cryptography``\n  will drop support for parsing them.\n* Added support for parsing PKCS12 files with friendly names for all\n  certificates with\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs12.load_pkcs12`,\n  which will return an object of type\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs12.PKCS12KeyAndCertificates`.\n* :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Name.rfc4514_string` and related methods now have\n  an optional ``attr_name_overrides`` parameter to supply custom OID to name\n  mappings, which can be used to match vendor-specific extensions.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Reverted the nonstandard formatting of\n  email address fields as ``E`` in\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Name.rfc4514_string` methods from version 35.0.\n<p>The previous behavior can be restored with:\n<code>name.rfc4514_string({NameOID.EMAIL_ADDRESS: &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;})</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x25519.X25519PublicKey</code>\nand\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x448.X448PublicKey</code> to\nbe used as public keys when parsing certificates or creating them with\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n  Multiple users have been running into problems with JWT based authentication where the multiple connection requests fail with `Invalid JWT` error.  We have reasons to believe that the most common cause is an expired token. There are two reasons for this issue: \r\n  \r\n1. Besides the expiration imposed by the JWT, there is another expiration imposed by Snowflake backend, which is `60 seconds` from the time of creation of the JWT, ergo, if a token reaches Snowflake backend `60 second` post it's creation the backend will consider it invalid and respond with a generic error message - `Invalid JWT Token`\r\n2. Snowflake also employs intermittent throttling if a particular backend instance is being inundated with connection requests. This is implemented in the form of `503` HTTP error code. So far the drivers have had a canopy approach to handle `503s` which is just retry the connection. This however doesn't work for JWT because there's high possibility that the JWT has passed its `60 second` lifetime mark during this retry mechanism. The driver can potentially keep retrying connection with an expired token till the backend finally can accept the request only to return an `Invalid JWT Token` error. \r\n\r\nThe current fix addresses this problem by moving the connection timeout logic from the Network layer abstraction to the connection layer abstraction within the driver.  Every authenticator now has the option to implement their own timeout handler. The fix implements a custom handler for JWT based auth and a default handler for all other authenticators. \r\n\r\nThe JWT handler instead of waiting to receive an error message, restricts the time spent in retrying to a configurable value that defaults to `10 seconds`. After this duration it traps the connection timeout exception to regenerate the token and initiates a retry with a newly generated token. This highly improves the chance of the backend receiving an unexpired token.  The retry attempts are also configurable but default to `10` since the timeout is quite small. \r\n\r\nThe fix has been manually tested. ",

Probably Anaconda is doing the same, it could be that your users are not using the correct compilers (i.e. they use their system ones instead of the Anaconda provided ones). Or they install the snowflake wheel and otherwise use C++ packages from Anaconda or conda-forge. This is sadly doesn't work and isn't fixable without abandoning the all-wheels users.",

      "This works for your use-case. However; I'm not sure that this would work for every SSO user.\r\nI know that in the URL we try to open we embed a port number where we expect the token to be posted to and then we open an HTTP server.\r\nI think doing something like that would be a better user experience than pasting back the url that the SSO redirects you to.",
      "Good point! This was my first thought too, but I also like this approach. We can additionally make the port configurable through an env var. WDYT? If yes, how should we name it? Do you have a convention for those?",
      "@sfc-gh-mkeller I tried it with a custom port, but the problem we are having is that we are running inside docker. Even though we are defining the right port in snowflake-connector-python and mapping it to the host, it won't work as it requires a browser afaik. So we can only use the host browser and then we have to pass back the token. Do you have any idea how this could work within docker other than manually passing in the url/token?",
      "One idea that might improve usability could be instead of redirecting to `localhost` and seeing an error message (e.g. \"This site can’t be reached\").\r\n\r\n`http://localhost:49251/?token=rVdZl6LIEn73V3jsx-qSVURPW3...`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1216955/143107325-dcd80aef-2259-496a-bd0d-0af3ab105e0c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could do something like this Google Auth mechanism:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1216955/143101696-b7e26b1c-f7d7-45cb-9b1d-e126fcec77a1.png)\r\n\r\nwhere the redirect is a page dedicated to copying the token, which can then be pasted in the token prompt box?\r\n\r\n`https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/approval/v2/approvalnativeapp?...`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1216955/143101236-4780dff6-09f5-4ef7-9042-88bcd3f02cf9.png)\r\n\r\nWould require a dedicated page for this on the snowflake site I suppose?",
      "This PR only changes the branch where we failed to open the browser, so perhaps this can be merged as it is?\r\n\r\nSince It doesn't change the functionality for people when the browser does open successfully. And those that don't have access to a browser will now be able to login 😃   \r\n\r\nImprovements to the rendering of the token (e.g. in a dedicated page on the snowflake website) vs copying the URL (this PR) could be made in the future change while maintaining backward compatibility by handling both bare tokens and URLs with a token query parameter in the parse method.",

This will\n  result in us incrementing the major version more frequently, but does not\n  change our existing backwards compatibility policy.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** The X.509 certificate parser no longer allows\n  negative serial numbers. :rfc:`5280` has always prohibited these.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Invalid ASN.1 found during :doc:`/x509/index`\n  parsing will raise an error on initial parse rather than when the invalid\n  field is accessed.\n* Rust is now required for building ``cryptography``, the\n  ``CRYPTOGRAPHY_DONT_BUILD_RUST`` environment variable is no longer\n  respected.\n* Parsers for :doc:`/x509/index` no longer use OpenSSL and have been\n  rewritten in Rust. This should be backwards compatible (modulo the items\n  listed above) and improve both security and performance.\n* Added support for OpenSSL 3.0.0 as a compilation target.\n* Added support for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.SM3` and\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.SM4`,\n  when using OpenSSL 1.1.1. These algorithms are provided for compatibility\n  in regions where they may be required, and are not generally recommended.\n* We now ship ``manylinux_2_24`` and ``musllinux_1_1`` wheels, in addition to\n  our ``manylinux2010`` and ``manylinux2014`` wheels. Users on distributions\n  like Alpine Linux should ensure they upgrade to the latest ``pip`` to\n  correctly receive wheels.\n* Added ``rfc4514_attribute_name`` attribute to :attr:`x509.NameAttribute\n  &lt;cryptography.x509.NameAttribute.rfc4514_attribute_name&gt;`.\n* Added :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.kbkdf.KBKDFCMAC`.\n<p>.. _v3-4-8:</p>\n<p>3.4.8 - 2021-08-24</p>\n<pre><code>\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and ``manylinux`` wheels to be compiled with\n  OpenSSL 1.1.1l.\n\n.. _v3-4-7:\n\n3.4.7 - 2021-03-25\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux</code> wheels to be compiled with\nOpenSSL 1.1.1k.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v3-4-6:</p>\n<p>3.4.6 - 2021-02-16\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

I have been looking for a way to contribute back to the community and I saw @sfc-gh-mkeller tagged this as a good first issue.  I have run the cpplint command and fixed all of the C++ files so that they include the standard C++ header files that they utilize instead of relying on a transitive include which may break in the future.  \r\n\r\n  Please let me know what else I can do to help this merge!\r\n  \r\n  \\~- Chuck -\\~",

      "The TL;DR of this PR is that we're upgrading from the AWS signature V2 to V4.\r\nFull documentation can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\r\n\r\nThese are a steps necessary in the process:\r\n1. Generate a canonical request, here's an example:\r\n   ```\r\n   GET\r\n   /\r\n   Action=ListUsers&Version=2010-05-08\r\n   content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8\r\n   host:iam.amazonaws.com\r\n   x-amz-date:20150830T123600Z\r\n   \r\n   content-type;host;x-amz-date\r\n   e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\r\n   ```\r\n   and then hash it, for this example assume hash: `f536975d06c0309214f805bb90ccff089219ecd68b2577efef23edd43b7e1a59`\r\n2. Generate a key to sign. Please see the details here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-calculate-signature.html (I feel like if I summarized it it wouldn't be much shorter than the actual documentation)\r\n3. With the hash from step 1 generate a string to sign, here's the example for our example:`\r\n   ```\r\n   AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\r\n   20150830T123600Z\r\n   20150830/us-east-1/iam/aws4_request\r\n   f536975d06c0309214f805bb90ccff089219ecd68b2577efef23edd43b7e1a59\r\n   ```\r\n   and sign it with the key generated in step 2.\r\n4. Finally add an `Authorization` header like so: `Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=<access key ID>/<credential scope>, SignedHeaders=<SignedHeaders>, Signature=<signature from step 3>` Where all of these parts come from the previous steps.\r\n\r\nIf you would like more details about the signing process, please schedule a meeting with me where we can go through the documentation together, since I actually think that the AWS documentation is good once you understand what they are talking about (their docs are definitely written by an engineer who works on this a lot)."

When using `ArrowResultBatch` we do need to send in a file like object, so I wrap the `bytes` in a `BytesIO`.\r\n\r\n   Successful performance test against Azure: https://jenkins.int.snowflakecomputing.com/job/ClientPerfRunner/8192/\r\n\r\n\r\n   Funny enough, these `ECONNRESET`s look to have been always happening with Azure, if you take a look at https://jenkins.int.snowflakecomputing.com/job/ClientPerfRunner/8107/artifact/python_connector.log.gz which is from before we merged the parallel fetch changes, you'll see that the same error happened and we just retried. We should maybe look into why these connections get reset.",

This avoids the overhead of re-establishing a connection with a new HTTP session thereby improving the performance.\r\n\r\nThe session management in `network.py` is also changed with this PR. In particular, a `_session_map` is maintained, which is a dict from hostnames to `SessionPool` objects. A `SessionPool` maintains a stack of idle connections and all active connections.\r\nThis improves the old session management by:\r\n- using a stack instead of a queue, as we want more recently used sessions to be re-used\r\n- segregating sessions by hostname. See [this](https://snowflakecomputing.atlassian.net/browse/SNOW-378283). In particular,\r\n> if you’re making several requests to the same host, the underlying TCP connection will be reused, which can result in a significant performance increase \r\n\r\nSome minor logging is also added to monitor how many unique connections are used.\r\n\r\nThings to do:\r\n- [X] Run benchmarks\r\n- [x] Test the session creation/deletion",

The best way to illustrate this would be with an example.\r\n\r\nWhen using `executemany` to insert values, you would use a command such as this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    cursor.executemany(\r\n        'INSERT INTO date_test (birth_date) values (?)',\r\n        [[datetime.date(1969, 2, 7)],[datetime.date(1969, 1, 1)]]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nThe `executemany` function would then transform the values in to a list like this ([see this](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/master/src/snowflake/connector/cursor.py#L985)) :\r\n  ```python \r\n\r\n[ datetime.date(1969, 2, 7), datetime.date(1969, 1, 1) ] \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would then determine the corresponding \"snowflake type\" for this list. [Lists are type \"TEXT\"](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/master/src/snowflake/connector/converter.py#L59) and thus when inserting these datetimes, Snowflake would interpret the epochs as \"TEXT\" which leads to the invalid dates appearing in the DB.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I have set the \"snowflake type\" to  \"TEXT\" by default. However, if all of the values of the list have a certain type, say \"DATE\" in this case, we would update the \"snowflake type\" to \"DATE\" - which leads to a valid insert. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, users can now use Tuples to specify exactly which type they would like.\r\nFor example, they may do this:\r\n```python\r\n    cursor.executemany(\r\n        'INSERT INTO date_test (birth_date) values (?)',\r\n        [\r\n               [ (\"DATE\", datetime.date(1969, 2, 7)) ],\r\n               [ (\"DATE\", datetime.date(1969, 1, 1)) ]\r\n        ]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

All usages of these constants are also replaced. In `arrow_iterator.pyx` I made sure to use the .value of the Enum to allow for string comparison\r\n- `cursor.py` has 2 new functions, `fetch_arrow_batches()` and `fetch_arrow_all()`, which use the corresponding `result_set.py` function\r\n- `result_set.py` no longer converts pyarrow.Tables to dataframes. Instead, `result_batch.py` will return a pyarrow.Table/dataframe where appropriate. This is specified by a keyword argument.\r\n- `result_batch.py`:\r\n    - added two new methods called `to_arrow` and `to_pandas`. These are implemented only by the `ArrowResultBatch`\r\n    - moved the existing `create_iter()` in `ArrowResultBatch` to be a protected member called `_create_iter()`. Created a new function called `create_iter()` to be the interface that `result_set` uses.\r\n    - created `get_pandas_iter()` and `get_arrow_iter()` which are both iterators as the name implies. `to_pandas()` and `to_arrow()` simply use these iterators",

    "body": "SNOW-300951\r\n\r\n# Introduction \r\n\r\nBack when we started on this project it was mainly to decrease the number of our dependencies and the overall size of snowflake-connector-python, as we can disregard all other capabilities other than blob storage.\r\n\r\nSince the start we ran into a few other issues with the cloud SDKs, like some more exotic proxies not being supported by the cloud SDKs and not supporting asyncio.\r\n\r\n# Design\r\n\r\n## Initial design\r\n\r\nDifferent blob storage services work mostly the same, but there are subtle differences. For example consider that on S3 we need to keep track of the block numbers and the returned etags for all the pieces for multipart upload, while on Azure we specify the certain block IDs when putting the pieces and then we send the list of those ids to an end-point, because of this we quickly arrived to a class design like this:\r\n\r\n![simplified sdkless class UML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63477823/123882867-8fbfc500-d8fc-11eb-9ee7-0b08765655e6.png)\r\n\r\nWhile performing PUT and GET operation most of the time is spent on the network calls, so we knew from the start that we needed to perform the network call in parallel.\r\nPreviously our method to parallelize execution was to use `ThreadPoolExecutor`s (I’ll be referring to them as `tpe`s from now on), which already handles some concurrency hurdles for us, but during this project their limitations became obvious.\r\n\r\n![simple sdkless transfer flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63477823/123882964-c72e7180-d8fc-11eb-80ba-a593634ebd5c.png)\r\n\r\nNotice that the idea was that the main thread would be doing most of the work and then it would let the `network_tpe` take care of network calls.\r\n\r\nOnce the implementation was semi complete we ran benchmark and found that performance suffered greatly at least on machines with limited computing power when compared to their network speed (such as cheaper EC2 machines).\r\n\r\nAs it turned out when only the network calls were parallelized compression became the most expensive operation. So after some back-and-forth we arrived to the final design.\r\n\r\n## Final design\r\n\r\n![sdkless transfer flow(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63477823/123882988-d4e3f700-d8fc-11eb-92b1-b686f83cb423.png)\r\n\r\nThe new idea in this iteration is that we have separate thread pools for CPU and network bound tasks.\r\n\r\nWhen designing the flow of files we wanted to make sure that if a chunk needed to be retried the queue to the `network_tpe` wasn’t too long so we introduced a conditional variable where each file chunk will wait to submit it’s chunk to the network tpe until the queue’s length is over 2 * max_concurrency. Once all of the chunks of a file have been processed by the `network_tpe` during a download gets submitted to the `postprocess_tpe` to be decrypted. In case of an upload, the last chunk to finish in the network_tpe makes a second call to finalize the file on blob storage. Note that the only difference between `preprocess_tpe` and `postprocess_tpe` is that we did not want to pollute the queue to the network_tpe with tasks that we can basically guaranteed to work.\r\n\r\n# Issues with ThreadPoolExecutors\r\n\r\n1. **Callbacks might be executed synchronously:** This is a gotcha of the tpes, if a thread submits a job and if that job is done by the time the thread is attaching a callback onto the future, then the callback will be executed by the thread that is attaching the callback to the future. For this reason we introduced the fn function_and_callback_wrapper that makes sure that the callback is called concurrently from the tpe.\r\n\r\n2. **Error handling in callbacks is non-existent in tpes:** We need to be careful how we handle errors inside of tpes. While calling `.result()` on a tpe raises the same exception that was raised in the callable that was executed there’s no such logic for Exceptions raised inside of callback function. For this reason we introduced manually track errors and handle them inside of the `SnowflakeFileTransferAgent.result`.\r\nCloses #284",

    "body": "SNOW-296993\r\n\r\nThis PR adds picklable `ResultChunk`s to the project. As an outcome please see the following codesnippet:\r\n```\r\nwith connect(**connection_config) as conn:\r\n    with conn.cursor() as cur:\r\n        cur.execute('select seq4() as n from table(generator(rowcount => 100000));')\r\n\t\tpartitions = cur.get_result_partitions()\r\n\r\nfor chunk in partitions:\r\n\tfor row in partitions:\r\n\t\tprint(row)\r\n```\r\nNote that partitions don't need a `SnowflakeConnection` anymore to download and parse their own results, but they do need `snowflake-connector-python` installed. They can also be iterated over multiple times. When you call `iter(partition)` it downloads its data, parses it and returns an `iterator` over the final data. This way things can be garbage collected when possible while working nicely with `ResultSet`s.\r\n\r\n`ResultSet`s provide a way for us to manage `ResultChunk`s they handle pre-fetching the 2nd-5th chunks of data, like how we used to pre-fetch data historically and it also provides us a way to collect metrics. Which are important, since a `ResultChunk` doesn't have a connection to Snowflake, while they collect their own numbers while working `ResultSet` is what actually send them to us when they finish iterating. Their one trick is their special chain function that allows used up `ResultChunk` iterators to fall out of usage to allow them to be garbage collected.\r\n\r\nReview notes:\r\nI'd start byreviewing `result_chunk.py`, then moving onto `result_set.py` those two files are most of the changes. The rest is just integrating them instead of `chunk_downloader.py`, `arrow_result.pyx`, `json_result.py`\r\n\r\nBehavior changes:\r\n* `cursor.rownumber` was incorrect before https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#rownumber and https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/e6137a05d184ec095bd6be50ff1bbd4e131064f4/test/integ/test_cursor.py#L933 Moved to SNOW-349276\r\n\r\nThings still needing to be done:\r\n* [x] Review all docstrings\r\n* [x] Review API names: Going to switch all name from `result` to `chunk` to be consistent with `fetch_pandas_chunk` API we already had\r\n* [x] Review behavior change: Moving into own Jira\r\n* [x] Figure out what's the issue with `codecov`: Nothing apparently.

When compared to #668 I needed to turn the function argument into a connection parameter, because of the case when Arrow is used automatically by the back-end then there's no way to pass an argument to the `__next__` function of the iterator through the results.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't exactly like putting all options as connection parameters I think we should rework our setting system to have most of them configurable on all of the following levels:\r\n* connection\r\n* cursor\r\n* statement (execution)\r\n\r\nI have filed myself the following ticket SNOW-302368 to come up with a good system for adding and handling these settings on all 3 of these levels at the same time.",

    "body": "This fix addresses the customer ticket SNOW-232777. \r\n\r\nA lot of Snowflake customers have strict data inspection requirements which requires them to use MiTM proxies. Python connector uses the Python Requests module to manage all the connectivity which internally takes care of connecting to proxies as well. However the Requests module internally uses urllib3 which internally uses http lib for connecting to proxies (python http lib > client.py > class HTTPConnection  > _tunnel() ). This routine only support HTTP/1.0 based CONNECT messages that do not need the presence of a HOST header in the connect request. The latest HTTP protocol RFC however mandates the presence of a HOST header in all CONNECT messages. \r\n\r\nThis PR creates a subclass of the Requests HTTPAdapter class to gain access to the ProxyManager class. The latter provides access to the proxy_header instance that can be manually updated to include the HOST header thereby forcing the underlying http lib to add that header to the initial CONNECT request. \r\n\r\nThis fix has been manually tested with pcaps collected and verified in Wireshark. Post this fix the initial CONNECT message to the proxy contains the HOST header. However we do not have access to a setup with a proxy that explicitly looks for such a header for us to test it.",

The primary user-facing changes are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Single-byte charset probers now use nested dictionaries under the hood, so they are usually a little faster than before. (See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chardet/chardet/issues/121\">#121</a> for details)</li>\n<li>The <code>CharsetGroupProber</code> class now properly short-circuits when one of the probers in the group is considered a definite match. This lead to a substantial speedup.</li>\n<li>There is now a <code>chardet.detect_all</code> function that returns a list of possible encodings for the input with associated confidences.</li>\n<li>We have dropped support for Python 2.6, 3.4, and 3.5 as they are all past end-of-life.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The changes in this release have also laid the groundwork for retraining the models to make them more accurate, and to support some more encodings/languages (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/chardet/chardet/issues/99\">#99</a> for progress). This is our main focus for chardet 5.0 (beyond dropping Python 2 support).</p>\n<h3>Benchmarks</h3>\n<p>Running on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) with  2.2GHz 6-core i7 processor and 32GB RAM</p>\n<h4>old version (chardet 3.0.4)</h4>\n<pre><code>Benchmarking chardet 3.0.4 on CPython 3.7.5 (default, Sep  8 2020, 12:19:42)\n[Clang 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62)]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCalls per second for each encoding:\nascii: 25559.439366240098\nbig5: 7.187002209518091\ncp932: 4.71090956645177\ncp949: 2.937256786994428\neuc-jp: 4.870580412090848\neuc-kr: 6.6910755971933416\neuc-tw: 87.71098043480079\ngb2312: 6.614302607154443\nibm855: 27.595893549680685\nibm866: 29.93483661732791\niso-2022-jp: 3379.5052775763434\niso-2022-kr: 26181.67290886392\niso-8859-1: 120.63424740403983\niso-8859-5: 32.65106262196898\niso-8859-7: 62.480089080556084\nkoi8-r: 13.72481001727257\nmaccyrillic: 33.018537255804496\nshift_jis: 4.996013583677438\ntis-620: 14.323112928341818\nutf-16: 166771.53081510935\nutf-32: 198782.18009478672\nutf-8: 13.966236809766901\nutf-8-sig: 193732.28637413395\nwindows-1251: 23.038910006925768\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This mfa token cache helps prevent multiple MFA authentication with a short perioud of time, which is similar to previous ID_TOKEN. In other words, if user's connection request is sent with a correct pwd (yes, pwd is still needed) and a valid mfa token, then users don't need to do mfa authentication again.\r\n\r\nWhat this pr does:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new authenticator USERNAME_PASSWORD_MFA. CLIENT_REQUEST_MFA_TOKEN parameter is added.\r\n2. Support both ID_TOKEN and MFATOKEN in Local Secure Storage.\r\n3. Change the way we name local cache of ID_TOKEN.\r\n4.

Due to limitations\n  imposed by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability and a\n  future release will contain a new API which is designed to be resilient to\n  these for contexts where it is required. Credit to **Hubert Kario** for\n  reporting the issue. *CVE-2020-25659*\n* Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed. Users on older version of OpenSSL\n  will need to upgrade.\n* Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder`.\n\n.. _v3-1-1:\n\n3.1.1 - 2020-09-22\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Updated Windows, macOS, and &lt;code&gt;manylinux&lt;/code&gt; wheels to be compiled with\nOpenSSL 1.1.1h.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;.. _v3-1:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3.1 - 2020-08-26&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based\n  :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes.

Due to limitations\n  imposed by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability and a\n  future release will contain a new API which is designed to be resilient to\n  these for contexts where it is required. Credit to **Hubert Kario** for\n  reporting the issue. *CVE-2020-25659*\n* Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed. Users on older version of OpenSSL\n  will need to upgrade.\n* Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder`.\n<p>.. _v3-1-1:</p>\n<p>3.1.1 - 2020-09-22\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux</code> wheels to be compiled with\nOpenSSL 1.1.1h.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v3-1:</p>\n<p>3.1 - 2020-08-26</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based\n  :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally\n  deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.\n* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by\n  the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support\n  for it.\n* Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will\n  be removed in the next release.\n* ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the\n  default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.\n* Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  and\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  .\n* Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``\n  longer than 2\\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This\n  also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.\n<p>.. _v3-0:</p>\n<p>3.0 - 2020-07-20\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

It does a few things:\r\n(Sorry, if I forget something I'll keep this list growing)\r\n\r\n- Add some more retryable errors (`TimeoutError`, `OSError`) to SSL checking.\r\n- Redefined `tox` test environments, they all use tags now instead of the exact folders. This allows us to mic and match them if necessary later on and cleans up our tox configuration quite a bit.\r\n- I defined test as a package, so we can import things from other directories inside of it.\r\n- Added a brand new `conftest.py` into integ with the extra fixtures that are necessary only for integration tests (so this means that if a dev is running unit tests locally, no Snowflake login is required).\r\n- Separated out unit tests from integration tests, where an integration test is defined as a tests that needs connection to a Snowflake deployment and unit tests are the leftovers (notice how unit tests still might require internet connection).\r\n- Our py.test code automatically tags tests with whatever folders they are in inside of the `test` directory.\r\n- Fixed a bug where a thread tried to acquire the same lock that it was holding already by using a `RLock` instead of a `Lock`.\r\n- From now on the default `cloud_provider` environmental variable will be `dev`, which will never be skipped. This is useful because since I added the test tagging for specific cloud providers I have been finding my default of AWS to be more annoying than anything. So if the env variable `cloud_provider` is not set than all tests should run instead of skipping.\r\n- Updated `test/README.rst` with the newest information.\r\n- Added a Lazy Variable class to our new test package, it is to replace variables defined outside of tests, to be used by multiple tests. It is necessary because if that variable needs an optional dependency to resolve then it should only be evaluated if one of the using tests is ran.",

      "SNOW-170139 SNOW-183907 Test PR 362 (#471)\n\n* Fixes #329, fixes #361\r\n\r\nAdd quote_identifier, columns defs to write_pandas\r\n\r\nquote_identifier allows the developer to choose wether or not to quote\r\nidentifiers when passing data to Snowflake. The\r\ndefault will be NOT to quote identifiers which aligns\r\nwith the Snowflake default of coercing lowercase identifiers to upper\r\nIf the developer specifies quote_identifiers=True, identifiers (e.g.\r\ncolumn names) will be quoted and match exactly to how they are\r\ndefined in the pandas DataFrame.\r\n\r\nSpecifying columns in the COPY INTO statement allows columns\r\nmissing in the dataframe with default vals defined in the table\r\ndefinition to be populated correctly instead of with NULL\r\n\r\nAdd tests for #329 and #361\r\n\r\nFix trailing whitespace\r\n\r\n* Update test/pandas/test_pandas_tools.py\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Mark Keller <63477823+sfc-gh-mkeller@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n* Set quote_identifiers default to True\r\n\r\n* Consolidate tests\r\n\r\n* Add quote_dentifiers to pd_writer\r\n\r\nAllows using quote_identifiers in `to_sql` using `functools.partial`\r\n\r\n* Add test for using pd_writer in pandas to_sql()\r\n\r\n* added a test to check whether autoincrement columns are inserted correctly and separated out default value insertion checking into its own test and removed a sqlalchemy test to be committed to sqlalchemy repo\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Kyle Flanagan <kyle.flanagan@agoradata.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: kyleflan <kyleflanagan@gmail.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Shige Takeda <shige.takeda@snowflake.com>"

Each event sub type will have a one-one mapping with documentation explaining what the error means and what are the potential solutions to look into. ",

For example, `Arrowiterator/BinaryConverter` uses `shared_ptr` but doesn't include `<memory>`. You're not getting any compiler warnings/errors because `<memory>` is probably included by some other header upstream of `Arrowiterator/BinaryConverter.hpp`.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes including those headers directly.\r\n\r\n## Why should we care about this PR?\r\n\r\nThe main benefit of this is explained in [\"Why Include What You Use?\"](https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md#allow-refactoring)\r\n\r\n> Suppose you refactor foo.h so it no longer uses vectors. You'd like to remove #include <vector> from foo.h, to reduce compile time -- template class files such as vector can include a lot of code. But can you? In theory yes, but in practice maybe not: some other file may be #including you and using vectors, and depending (probably unknowingly) on your #include <vector> to compile. Your refactor could break code far away from you.\r\n\r\n> This is most compelling for a very large codebase (such as Google's). In a small codebase, it's practical to just compile everything after a refactor like this, and clean up any errors you see. When your codebase contains hundreds of thousands of source files, identifying and cleaning up the errors can be a project in itself. In practice, people are likely to just leave the #include <vector> line in there, even though it's unnecessary.\r\n\r\n> Here, it's the actual 'include what you use' policy that saves the day. If everyone who uses vector is #including <vector> themselves, then you can remove <vector> without fear of breaking anything.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and consideration.",

These tags are automatically skipped when running test if not matching `cloud_provider` env variable (`aws` assumed if not set). I have updated already existing tests to use these. Note that these are set on GH actions and Jenkins too.\r\n* Updated how `precommit-hooks` run. Fixed up all files.\r\n* (Possibly forgot changes)\r\n\r\nI'll be squashing all these commits into one before merging.\r\n\r\nThings that still need to be done:\r\n- [ ] Switch Jenkins tests to the new ones\r\n- [ ] Move developers over\r\n- [ ] Sync monorepo -> this repo one last time\r\n- [ ] Decide when to run what tests, right now we run all tests for every push to `master` and for PRs (opened by a maintainer)",

Produce closure functions for column conversion instead of passing\r\n   context to each column conversion function.  This enables higher\r\n   levels of optimizations for column conversion including the option\r\n   to skip it alltogether (return None instead of a func).\r\n3. Fine tune several datetime related column converter functions for\r\n   performance.\r\n\r\nThis commit improves performance for complex datasets by about 60%.\r\n\r\n* Fix some row filtering issues Shige found.\r\n\r\nThe first bit of data from a chunk is actually in the result from\r\nSnowflake's APIs (instead of S3).  We need to process this row in the\r\nsame way it gets processed by the chunk_downloader code now that\r\nfetchone() doesn't do row processing itself.\r\n\r\nUse tzlocal import testing consistently in converter code.\r\n\r\nInstead of passing `_row_to_python` to the chunk_downloader which\r\nalready has access to the cursor instance, just make `row_to_python`\r\npublic (remove the `_`) and have it call the instance method of cursor\r\ndirectly.  Simplifies the setup for chunk_downloader to its original\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n* Revert row processing context.\r\n\r\nMove row processing back to fetchone() context.  This consolidates\r\nexception handling to that one location without need for use of Future\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nWe may still go with Futures and Executor based pools later but it's not\r\nproven if multiprocess based executors are safe and/or worthwhile. Given\r\nthe their unproven nature, Shige and I are going to work on getting the\r\ncolumn conversion optimizations of this branch into master before\r\ntackling anything more drastic.\r\n\r\n* Remove unused import\r\n\r\n* Use alt logger syntax for string formatting."
