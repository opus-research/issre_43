The `LoginViewModel` gives us a neat _viewmodelScope_ to run suspend functions from, and is easily created and called from Java code.  (Google's view models will also survive config change too, so we should definitely look at adopting them to deal with the myriad of other related bugs)\r\n\r\nAll of that is the _support_ ready for the real change of moving to coroutines.

And if it is a \"genuine\" failure we abandon the retry attempt.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by in uploadWorker passing along the failure point and any accompanying exceptions through two new fields in Contributions. And then checking if these qualify as a \"genuine\" failure through a simple whitelist of known \"genuine\" failure patterns and exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a draft because we wont be able to continue further due to our course ending.

And if it is a \"genuine\" failure we abandon the retry attempt.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by in uploadWorker passing along the failure point and any accompanying exceptions through two new fields in Contributions. And then checking if these qualify as a \"genuine\" failure through a simple whitelist of known \"genuine\" failure patterns and exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a draft because we wont be able to continue further due to our course ending.

The fix ensures that the progress bar is hidden and the UI is updated correctly upon successful deletion also the Snackbar is shown when the nomination is done successfully.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Modified the `onDeleteClicked()` & `onDeleteClickeddialogtext`  & created a `handleDeletionResult()` for handling what to do on success, created a `handleDeletionError()` for handling what to do on failure. \r\n- Ensured that UI updates are performed on the UI thread to prevent potential `CalledFromWrongThreadException`.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n### Steps to Test\r\n1. Open the app.\r\n2. Open any contribution.\r\n3. Click on the nomination for deletion.\r\n4. Observe the progress bar behavior after the nomination process completes.\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n- The circular progress bar should disappear, indicating that the process has completed.\r\n- The user should see a confirmation message indicating the successful nomination for deletion.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\n- Tested on both emulators and physical devices to verify the fix.\r\n",

      "> With this branch I still see the `Please wait dialog` in-between images, is that expected?\r\n\r\n@nicolas-raoul , `Please Wait` dialog will have to be there, because caption has to be checked everytime user hits submit button (as it can be changed by user). What I have done is checking the quality of the image as soon as it's loaded (and storing that of the next ones), instead of when user enters all description and hits submit, just to be told that the image is already present on Commons, etc. [Here](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/4704#issuecomment-1925258671) is the flow I implemented and screencast is present in the description of this PR. Please let me know your thoughts on this :)",

But is it not too late to throw this at the user after they've entered all their details?\r\n\r\nCould we not do it as soon as they open the app? Doing it on each open might be a bit costly, may be we could cache the result and re-check once in a few hours?\r\n\r\nOr if that sounds too complex, may be just check the validity right when the upload is initiated via the UI?

If we do it let's say every few hours then there would remain a possibility that the user encounters this same issue when they change their password during that period (Hence we need to handle that case anyway, as we are doing in this PR), we can implement this and also have the changes the I made in this PR currently so that there is no cases where user does not get a clear message after upload failure.\r\n\r\nSo my proposed solution is: \r\n-> Make the check when a user opens the app and re-check once in a few hours\r\n-> Also keep these changes to handle the above case (2)\r\n\r\nThis way we are making fewer network requests and ensuring that there are no cases where the user does not get a clear message after upload failure.\r\n\r\nPlease Let me know what you think about this solution",

If I understand it correctly, the two options are not exclusive.\r\n\r\nWhen tokens are invalidated, it's done on the server side, and we don't know when it will happen. There is a chance that it will happen during the upload process (and the user can take time to choose categories and other options).

If I understand it correctly, the two options are not exclusive.\r\n>\r\n> When tokens are invalidated, it's done on the server side, and we don't know when it will happen. There is a chance that it will happen during the upload process (and the user can take time to choose categories and other options). So I don't think we have to choose between the two timings of checking - I think we want to do both.\r\n>\r\n\r\nI agree with you on this. We would indeed need both of those options. On a side note, it would be worth exploring how the Wikipedia app handles this. They do have [a logout method](https://github.com/wikimedia/apps-android-wikipedia/blob/main/app/src/main/java/org/wikipedia/WikipediaApp.kt#L254C9-L254C15) similar to ours.

      "> On this branch, the Requesting location permission dialog keeps popping up even after I tap on \"Don't ask again\" [[Screencast](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BD1ZUgf0KlEgqY6YsnUndTEfOSszFKpI/view?usp=sharing)]. I know the two dialogs are different, but if users do not want to share their location, continuously asking for it whenever they switch to Nearby tab can be annoying, plus it gives an impression that the functionality won't work at all without giving location access, though that's not the case. We can still manually choose a location and upload (the coordinates can be misleading, but that is currently supported by the app). Even if we don't allow such uploads, users should be permitted to use the map in Explore, at least. How about adding a toast for it?\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce this issue on devices running API level 31 and API 27, but it never occured. The dialog requesting user to give permission by going to settings, pops up only when the target icon is clicked, not when switched to the Nearby tab. Here's the recording of the device running API 27:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1w9l4ePTxnn7q-3q758QfID8Y87aFHAkA/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n> Also, the dialog to show nearby places when a user wants to use the in-app camera is a bit unrelated [[Screencast](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BbeGJ8Nka4K5JQyx9et9zseou9H2l4o9/view?usp=sharing)]. Could you please check this as well?\r\n\r\nUm, I realised that I missed fixing the flow of the in-app camera location permission. For the time being, I have fixed this particular issue, but the code already present has some redundancy, which should be fixed. If you agree, I will fix the in-app camera location flow in a separate PR, and we'll close #5256 only after that PR is merged since this PR is already handling 3 issues.\r\n\r\n",

On the contrary, I noticed that if I deny the permission once, and hit \"OK\" in the next rationale dialog, it pops up a dialog to turn on GPS, even though location permission is not there with the app. This [Screencast](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/assets/142137555/90c6558d-3e26-4f3e-81e5-aef66b53dbde) shows both behaviours I'm referring to.

The PR introduces Google's `FragmentScenario` - designed for unit testing Fragments - along with a slight bump to some library versions.  \r\n\r\n`FragmentScenario` gives you complete control of the Fragment lifecycle and coupled with Robolectric allows you to _safely_ run through the `onCreateView()` method to create real components removing the need for all the mock objects. As you can see from the PR, this **greatly** simplifies the test!\r\n\r\nThe pattern for other tests will be fairly similar to - \r\n```kotlin\r\nprivate lateinit var scenario: FragmentScenario<ContributionsListFragment>\r\nprivate lateinit var fragment: ContributionsListFragment\r\n```\r\n\r\nand in the setup method\r\n```kotlin\r\nscenario = launchFragmentInContainer(\r\n    initialState = Lifecycle.State.RESUMED,\r\n    themeResId = R.style.LightAppTheme\r\n) {\r\n    ContributionsListFragment().apply {\r\n        // ... setup mock objects on the target class, if needed\r\n    }.also {\r\n        fragment = it\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nif you dont want to keep a fragment reference, then use `FragmentScenario` - \r\n```kotlin\r\nscenario.onFragment {\r\n    // \"it\" is the fragment we're testing\r\n    it.adapter = adapter\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "**Description (required)**\r\n\r\nRegarding issue #5246, the idea is to have variants of the map icon (that enables the user to manually add the location for the image EXIF) in the Upload Wizard. \r\n\r\nSimilar to the suggestion in the issue's discussion thread, my idea is to have the map icon labelled with a red question mark if the location is not to be uploaded. On the other hand, if the location is included in the EXIF, the map icon is labelled with a green tick. See the icons below.\r\n\r\nI used Inkscape to modify the SVG path data and transformed it back to the Android XML format. Just wonder if there are any more intuitive and clear icons than the currently proposed ones. If so, we can create and test them in the app.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the change in the map icon, I reckon that the location is included by default if the image is taken by the in-app camera. That's why there is concern that users may unintentionally share their location as mentioned in the issue thread. For this, we use `inAppPictureLocation` to determine which icon to display.\r\n\r\nAnother situation is when the user manually pinpoints a location. The map icon is then labelled with a green tick.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to have insights for:\r\n- Whether the icons with \"?\" and \"‚úì\" are intuitive enough, or if there are even better alternatives\r\n  - Since the icon displayed in the upload wizard is pretty small, probably not include complex graphics\r\n- The SVG data in the XML (since the additional icon is generated by Inkscape)\r\n- If any, cases when the icon should be changed but I missed here\r\n\r\nIf the location removal feature in #5262 is available, then I guess this shall also be extended (i.e. changing the green tick back to a red question mark).\r\n\r\n**Tests performed (required)**\r\n\r\nTo be completed after confirming details.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots (for UI changes only)**\r\n\r\n![Original map icon](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/assets/53111300/4bba52ce-fc6c-4e25-a6db-cf5a06092370)\r\n![Map icon with a red question mark](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/assets/53111300/8bc9d126-8117-41c5-b153-df767625c387)\r\n![Map icon with a green tick](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/assets/53111300/213ca784-626e-488c-bbf9-e88c1f672fbb)\r\n",

      "Did you test on API level 12? The `minSdkVersion` is 21, I'm not sure if things would work normally on lower API levels.",

The production server is working fine in my case and the image got uploaded successfully :) \r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for assuming that both the flavours behave in the same way and the upload would fail on the prod flavour too. I ended up uploading a test image on the prod flavour. Might be taken up as a separate issue later; I'm still facing issues on the beta flavour.\r\n",

Android has made it mandatory for apps targeting S+ (API level 31 and above) to pass either `FLAG_MUTABLE` or `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` with `PendingIntent` (based on my logcat error).\r\n\r\nThe above changes apparently fixed stuck uploads. The uploads, however, still fail with a `SocketTimeoutException`. \r\n- Implemented retries in `onResume()` so that failed uploads resume as soon as the user returns to the app. The code related to this may be improved with correct usage of WorkManager, but I need to investigate its behaviour on various devices under different network and battery conditions.\r\n\r\n**Key improvements:** \r\nUploads no longer remain stuck and resume automatically in case the user returns to the app within 2 minutes (the connection time associated with the `SocketTimeoutException`). After 2 minutes, a \"Failed to upload\" notification is shown for all the uploads but these failed uploads, too, start as soon as the user returns to the app because of the retry logic. \r\n\r\nThis may not be the best solution, so I'm adding a WIP/Draft status to it.\r\n\r\n**Further improvements I am looking forward to:**\r\nI'll be researching more about network conditions when the screen is turned off. Even if Android provides a small window to resume work under \"Optimised\" battery conditions, we can fix the `SocketTimeout` issue.  \r\n\r\n**Tests performed (required)**\r\n\r\nTested prodDebug on Moto g62 with API level 31.\r\n",

      ">  In the Android 8 and 12 devices, the location fails to be identified during the first upload. It's recognized in next upload attempts and attached properly, though.\r\n\r\nNot very surprising. This happens even on (many) default camera applications. When we allow location access for the first time, apps, including the camera apps, search for GPS. The time taken to search for GPS _appears_ significantly less (usually) in subsequent runs because location is turned on already and the user spends enough time before tapping the click button. So, even default applications do not recognise locations in the first click. \r\n\r\nThis \"searching for GPS\" operation usually takes 5-7 seconds on my device but sometimes it may take longer (I mean too long sometimes). I can add a delay for the first upload for the app to search for GPS first and only then allow users to use the camera. I hope this will not give an impression that the in-app camera does not work at all to some users because of the long delay. Adding a threshold limit may help too. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n",
      "Adding a few more alternatives to resolve the above problem. \r\n\r\n1. We can consider using a progress bar or animated icon that indicates the progress of GPS initialization. This visual feedback can make the waiting process more engaging and provide users with a sense of progress and the users know that the in-app camera is working.\r\n\r\n2. Overlay a transparent educational message or tip on the camera screen during the first upload attempt. This message can explain the delay and encourage users to hold steady or wait a few seconds for accurate location tagging. We need to ensure that the overlay is unobtrusive and doesn't interfere with the camera's functionality.\r\n\r\n3. Display contextual tips or suggestions on the camera screen while the app is searching for GPS. These tips can include photography advice, composition tips, or information about nearby points of interest. This way, users have something informative and entertaining to engage with while they wait.\r\n\r\nWe would have to check the feasibility to implement these alternatives. ",

But it seemed okay to make the user try tapping the camera icon again on returning. This allowed me to introduce some delay. Since this also shows a notification in the status bar, it is quite possible for the user to wait for the GPS to turn on before tapping again. This did not appear very intuitive to me in case location is turned on in the Settings already and user just has to tap on \"Allow\" for `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission within the app. \r\n\r\nShowing the dialog for the first time will not guarantee that it won't happen in subsequent uploads too.

      "Hi Rikita,\r\n\r\nI tried to run your branch to find the root cause of the test failures. It requires upgrading to a newer SDK version of 29 (Currently at 21). But I'm not sure how feasible this is since we try to keep the SDK version as low as possible to not disadvantage people who do not have access to recent technology. Version 29 covers only about 68% of the android users. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"536\" alt=\"224227843-e15417cc-0379-4bb2-83ac-f306c728605e\" src=\"https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/assets/93285364/0fe923fa-2990-404f-905c-4458cf7e920a\">\r\n",
      "Thanks Ritika for the pull request and Kartikay for the code review and investigation!\r\n\r\nI believe that [this similar pull request](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/pull/5190/files) did not break unit tests... How about adding more `if` statements where needed so that each version of Android gets tested successfully, without upgrading to SDK version of 29 if possible?",
      "I thought the CI is failing on master too and did not add any extra if statements to the code in that pull request. We are already using 29 as the minSDK version and the app does not run on any devices running an API level below 29. Some of the tests did have SDK version as 21 before the minSDK version was changed.  I wonder if the app would run with an SDK version of 21 in the tests as it is not running on physical devices tooü§îI'll just check out. Thank you for the hint!",
      "@RitikaPahwa4444 You are right. The test failures are not a consequence of your changes. They're due to bumping the minSDk to 29 (which we should reduce back to 21 soonish [[ref](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/5223)]).\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you could feel free to specify the minSdk as 21 locally and run the unit tests. That should help for the meanwhile.",
      "Thanks for letting us know about the unit tests failing in the current master, I created a new issue about that: https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/5228\r\n\r\nIt seems like unit tests were running fine for the PR I mentioned above: https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/pull/5190/checks so hopefully the changes in the present PR should not trigger new fails either. :-)",

      "Hi Nicolas, I'm somehow not able to reproduce this on my Android 13 emulator and would need some additional details too, to understand the underlying cause in case of Nearby. Could you please share a screencast too? May be I'm missing out on something while testing :')",
      "@RitikaPahwa4444 As we've observed, the MEDIA_LOCATION permission seems to be handled differently in Android 13.

Any hints on it would be helpful with solving the core issue in a bettwe way üôÇ ",
      "@sivaraam, Nearby is working fine for me on both Android 12 and 13. I think if the ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION is working fine for the custom selector, it should work for Nearby too. I'll check why the behaviour is still different on some devices.",
      "> @sivaraam, Nearby is working fine for me on both Android 12 and 13. I think if the ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION is working fine for the custom selector, it should work for Nearby too.\r\n\r\nI could confirm this. This MR results in the location being recognized while using the normal file picker / while uploading via Nearby. I'm check this using a Nord running Android 12.\r\n\r\nWith respect to checking this on Android 13, our app still only targets API level 31 (Android 11). Android 13 has quite a few changes w.r.t accessing media files [[ref](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granular-media-permissions)]. So, would it be ideal to first make our app target API level 33 while making the changes necessary for the same before verifying if the choosing media files works properly on it ? \r\n\r\nThis article has some good information: [Android 13 changelog: A deep dive by Mishaal Rahman](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive). Specifically, I found the sections on \"[More granular media file permission](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_file_permissions) and \"[system photo picker](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#system_photo_picker)\" to be informative.\r\n\r\n",
      "I don't think the new Photo Picker allows location access through EXIF data. This photo picker ignores the `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` permission completely, as discussed in [this](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/243294058#comment8) comment on the Google issue tracker. So, I am not sure if targeting API level 33 will have any effect as far as this issue is concerned. ",

Used `==` instead of bitwise AND (&). Moreover, the unit test was checking against error code -7, which corresponds to none of the bad image options. So, modified the unit test to randomly pick one of the eligible error codes. \r\n\r\nAfter fixing the above unit test, I observed that `handleBadImageBaseTestFileNameExists()` was failing too because the error code -4 was recently modified to 64 and usage of bitwise AND (&) had the same effect as in the case of `EMPTY_CAPTION`. Fixed that too so that `UploadMediaPresenterTest` does not fail.\r\n\r\n**Tests performed (required)**\r\n\r\nTested prodDebug on Redmi 5A with API level 27.\r\n",

      "@RitikaPahwa4444 You might have to make a few changes after rebasing with the latest version of Master. After the changes for moving from Mapbox to MapLibre, we now have the option to get a predefined style based on the type of configuration we choose. It could be Mapbox, MapLibre, or MapTiler. \r\n\r\nIn order to retain the original configuration, we chose to retain the configuration type Mapbox. For ex: Style.DARK would now be used as Style.getPredefinedStyle(\"Dark\")",
      "Indeed, Rikita would you mind rebasing and writing setStyle like on this line: https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/pull/5184/files#diff-b503ac9d99a74afbbde1ec04f8f774fd92a69b3a7e940233b82df7b9c3db59f0L319\r\n\r\nBy the way, do not hesitate to create constants or otherwise factorize the first argument of `setStyle` with other usages, if you think it makes sense.\r\n\r\nThanks both!",

      "Hi @nicolas-raoul, thank you for merging the PR. I had noticed those occurrences but refrained from modifying them in this pull request as they were not a part of this issue. Is it okay if I create a common constants file for all the map styles that the app is using: Outdoors, Dark and Streets? Using the `LocationPickerConstants` file does not sound appropriate if we are using these styles across the other fragments too like `ExploreMapFragment` and `NearbyParentFragment` as they are located in separate directories in the project and are logically different.",

    "body": "**Description (required)**\r\n\r\nFixes #4607\r\n### What changes did you make and why?\r\n#### Cause of bug:\r\nOn start of an upload activity, each `uploadableFile` has a `UploadMediaDetailFragment` and its own `UploadMediaPresenter`. The fragment calls `init()` which calls `presenter.receiveImage(uploadableFile, place)`. The side effect of this is to create an `uploadItem` for this `uploadableFile` and add to the repository which acts as the 'master copy' of uploadItem if one is not already present. However, the new `uploadItem` is always used in `receiveImage` even if one already exists. \r\n\r\nOn removal of an item from the upload list as happens when it is flagged and 'cancel' is clicked, the current presenter seems to be destroyed and a new one is created for the fragment. This calls `init` again which proceeds to attempt to call `receiveImage` again. A new `uploadItem` is created for the same file (which has none of the caption & description details) and runs the same code to eventually get displayed, thus showing the empty one. Notably, this `uploadItem` is not in the `repository` and thus any changes to it makes no actual difference to the final uploads. \r\n\r\n#### Proposed fix:\r\nIf the newly created UploadItem already has an older 'master copy' of it available, `UploadItem::createAndAddUploadItem`changes to return the old copy instead of not adding it but still returning the new copy.\r\n\r\n### **Tests performed (required)**\r\n\r\nTested Build Variant: Tested BetaDebug on Pixel XL with API level 30.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following testing was performed:\r\nI used https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bergtocht_van_Guarda_via_Ardez_en_Ftan_naar_Scuol._20-09-2019._(actm.)_27.jpg as the image that would be flagged as problematic. \r\n\r\n1. Upload 3 images in the order of normal 1, flagged, normal 2\r\n2. Add caption and description and change language structure for first image, copy to remaining.\r\n3. Go to image 2, press next, get flagged and press cancel. This should remove the image.\r\n4. Third image, which is normal 2 will immediately appear. This correctly contains the caption, description and language structure of image 1. \r\n5. Edited all three fields and continue to upload all images. The final images shown in the home page correctly records the latest values. \r\n\r\nI also redid the above test but at step 3, before pressing next, I edited all 3 fields and copied them to the remaining (so only the last image has it). Then continued and the behavior was as expected.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots (for UI changes only)**\r\n\r\nNeed help?

For that it uses the `Context.getPackageManager()` function, but since Android 11 the package manager doesn't have access to all the applications installed on the device, because of that the application doesn't find the Github application and it throws a toast saying that \"No web browser found to open URL\".\r\nThe solution is specifying the name of the package of the third party application (in this case the GitHub app) on the intent, using the `Intent.setPackage()` function, and try to open the link on the application, starting a new activity. If the application is not found, the link is opened on the web browser.\r\n\r\n**Tests performed (required)**\r\n\r\nTested ProdDebug on Pixel 4 with API level 27 & 30.\r\n\r\nNeed help?

How should I go about proposing such a change? ",
      "About showAlertDialog: Feel free to create a new issue about it, and then feel free to send a pull request for it if you want. Thanks for noticing! üôÇ",
      "Yea sure! I believe the app records some metadata under `defaultKvStore` which shows the number of consecutive uploads without location. The tracking and editing of this number is done in `UploadPresenter::handleSubmit` which seems to do it correctly by individually reviewing each item uploaded individually.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs as the actual reminder mechanism is done one step before in `UploadActivity` which checks to see if a reminder should be shown and then calls `handleSubmit`. However, I think `UploadActivity`  has no access to the items being uploaded and essentially just looks at the value in `defaultKvStore` to decide if a reminder should be shown regardless of what the current items being uploaded are. \r\n\r\nSo this would explain how after you've uploaded many items without location, there is no reminder. Then the next image uploaded with location still has a reminder because the app looks at the count, sees that it is >= threshold and sends the reminder without reviewing the items that are about to be uploaded. This change now includes both the consecutive count and the current items to decide if it should show a reminder.",

Increasing the size of the progress bar might disturb the nearby elements and so, I enabled auto-scaling of the text.\r\n\r\nFor defining the UI, Commons makes use of the dependency: com.dinuscxj:circleprogressbar:1.1.1 (Available [here](https://github.com/dinuscxj/CircleProgressBar.git)). \r\n\r\nSince this library does not handle larger numbers even in the latest version, they get cropped in the Achievements fragment.

Increasing the size of the progress bar might disturb the nearby elements and so, I enabled auto-scaling of the text.\r\n\r\nFor defining the UI, Commons makes use of the dependency: com.dinuscxj:circleprogressbar:1.1.1 (Available [here](https://github.com/dinuscxj/CircleProgressBar.git)). \r\n\r\nSince this library does not handle larger numbers even in the latest version, they get cropped in the Achievements fragment.

      "Thanks for the PR @neslihanturan ! I will test ASAP, but in the meantime I did notice that the format of the date that we are outputting in the template at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ACommons_app_exif_issue.jpg \"2022:07:03 (according to Exif data)\" is somewhat unusual. @nicolas-raoul @whym do we know if this format is acceptable for the template? \r\n\r\nIt definitely doesn't work with the category, as [Photographs taken on 2022:07:03](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Photographs_taken_on_2022:07:03&action=edit&redlink=1) leads to an invalid link (but I am aware that that is still work in progress).",
      "Yeah, the end result should look like \"{{According to Exif data|2022-07-03}}\". (=joined by \"-\", and zero padded) In the source code it will look like\r\n```\r\n-            String dateCreatedString = year+\":\"+month+\":\"+day;\r\n+            String dateCreatedString = String.format(\"%04d-%02d-%02d\", Integer.parseInt(year), Integer.parseInt(month), Integer.parseInt(day));\r\n```\r\n (combining the preceding 3 parseInt lines into one)\r\n\r\nThis would be in line with the \"yyyy-MM-dd\" format already used elsewhere in the app's codebase.\r\n\r\n(That said, the template could be made more flexible to accept different formats, if there is a legitimate need to do so, by submitting an edit request at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:According_to_Exif_data .)",
      "Here is my test with a picture taken after 3pm JST: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Motomiya,_Tsurumi.jpg\r\nAs you can see `{{According to Exif data|2022:07:12}}` was generated, which is the right date but with a formatting that does not seem to fit the category.

      "Hi @neslihanturan , thanks for the PR! It's exciting to see the progress of this feature. :)\r\n\r\nI tested this on my real device (noting, as you mentioned above, that some functionality is missing). A few notes:\r\n- It took a very, very long time to display the pins the first time I loaded Nearby. Roughly 3 minutes, according to my timestamps. There were also two loading progress bars running simultaneously, overlapping each other.\r\n- \"Search this area\" actually works perfectly for me! :) Great job with fixing that.\r\n- Some of the UI elements seem a bit out of place. Referring to the screenshot below, the \"center map on user\" button and scale indicator is in the wrong spot, and the Mapbox links are displaying raw HTML.\r\n\r\nI completely understand that this is WIP. The code looks good to me, otherwise. Looking forward to being able to merge!\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20220326-033516_Commons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3611199/160173291-c6831770-4696-4026-a8c0-ff8f387cb85e.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
      "@neslihanturan Tested this again and it looks amazing now!! Nice work! üöÄ \r\n\r\nThe load times, search this area, tapping individual images, links etc all work perfectly for me.\r\n\r\nJust a couple of minor issues: \r\n1. I know that in Commons all the images have \"File:\" and \".jpg\" (or other file type) prefixes and suffixes to them, but I don't think that this is needed in a user-facing image browsing app. So for instance, in the screenshot below I think the image title should just be \"Sunset in Beachmere at low-tide Moreton Marine Park\". This should apply in both the expanded and non-expanded views.\r\n2. Similarly, I think \"Media Details\" should be shortened to just \"Details\", which also makes it tidier on most screen sizes.\r\n\r\nAgain, great job and looking forward to releasing this soon! :)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20220405-185818_Commons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3611199/161718737-e2b9a249-9879-4a2d-854d-9585e8e6f017.jpg)\r\n\r\n",

This helps remove the while loop in UploadWorker which was meant to handle the cases where a new worker would be created for retries. The while loop seemed to have race conditions uploading duplicate entries.\r\n\r\n* Update states to IN_PROGRESS before uploads are processed\r\n\r\n* Fixes #3694 Pre-select places as depictions (#4452)\r\n\r\n* WikidataEditService: stop automatically adding WikidataPlace as a depiction\r\n\r\nWhen the user initiates the upload process from Nearby and also manually adds the place as a depiction, the depiction is added twice. Since this behavior is invisible to the user, it is being removed in preparation for auto-selecting the place as a depiction on the DepictsFragment screen.\r\n\r\n* DepictsFragment: auto-select place as a depiction\r\n\r\nPass the Place reference from UploadActivity to DepictsFragment and select the corresponding DepictedItem. Using the place id, retrieve the corresponding Entity to create and select a DepictedItem.\r\n\r\n* UploadRepository: use Place from UploadItem to obtain a DepictedItem\r\n\r\nInstead of passing a Place object from UploadActivity to DepictsFragment and then passing the Place object up the chain to obtain and select a DepictedItem, retrieve the Place object directly within UploadRepository\r\n\r\n* DepictsFragment: select Place depiction when fragment becomes visible\r\n\r\n* UploadDepictsAdapter: make adapter aware of selection state\r\n\r\nUpdate selection state when recycled list items are automatically selected, preventing automatically selected items from appearing as unselected until they are forced to re-bind (i.e. after scrolling)\r\n\r\n* DepictsFragment: pre-select place depictions for all UploadItems\r\n\r\nIf several images are selected and set to different places, pre-select all place depictions to reinforce the intended upload workflow philosophy (i.e. all images in a set are intended to be from/of the same place).

This helps remove the while loop in UploadWorker which was meant to handle the cases where a new worker would be created for retries. The while loop seemed to have race conditions uploading duplicate entries.\r\n\r\n* Update states to IN_PROGRESS before uploads are processed\r\n\r\n* Fixes #3694 Pre-select places as depictions (#4452)\r\n\r\n* WikidataEditService: stop automatically adding WikidataPlace as a depiction\r\n\r\nWhen the user initiates the upload process from Nearby and also manually adds the place as a depiction, the depiction is added twice. Since this behavior is invisible to the user, it is being removed in preparation for auto-selecting the place as a depiction on the DepictsFragment screen.\r\n\r\n* DepictsFragment: auto-select place as a depiction\r\n\r\nPass the Place reference from UploadActivity to DepictsFragment and select the corresponding DepictedItem. Using the place id, retrieve the corresponding Entity to create and select a DepictedItem.\r\n\r\n* UploadRepository: use Place from UploadItem to obtain a DepictedItem\r\n\r\nInstead of passing a Place object from UploadActivity to DepictsFragment and then passing the Place object up the chain to obtain and select a DepictedItem, retrieve the Place object directly within UploadRepository\r\n\r\n* DepictsFragment: select Place depiction when fragment becomes visible\r\n\r\n* UploadDepictsAdapter: make adapter aware of selection state\r\n\r\nUpdate selection state when recycled list items are automatically selected, preventing automatically selected items from appearing as unselected until they are forced to re-bind (i.e. after scrolling)\r\n\r\n* DepictsFragment: pre-select place depictions for all UploadItems\r\n\r\nIf several images are selected and set to different places, pre-select all place depictions to reinforce the intended upload workflow philosophy (i.e. all images in a set are intended to be from/of the same place).

There was a function HideLayouts() which was hiding all the layouts till the fetching of all data is complete.\r\n3. when their visibility was again set to VISIBLE it was not working properly because, in HideLayouts() we were hiding complete relative layouts and according to android documentation hiding complete layouts cannot be undo after loading activity(or after execution of onCreate function, hideLayout() was called inside onCreate and commands for showing layout were called outside onCreate thats why this problem was occuring).\r\n4. as they all are linked using bindview like \"RelativeLayout layoutImageUploaded;\" , using layoutImageUploaded.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE); makes them invisible but when we try to use visible it doesn't work.\r\n5. I have currently deleted the HideLayouts() funtion and removed it from places it was called.\r\n6. It is now working all fine according to me.\r\n6. If you want me to keep it like it was earlier and find a way to display layout after fetching results I could try that : )\r\n\r\n**Tests performed (required)**\r\n\r\nTested {build variant, e.g. ProdDebug} on {Realme 3 pro} with API level {29}.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots (for UI changes only)**\r\n![WhatsApp Image 2020-12-28 at 1 24 47 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54104573/103178832-910c2880-48ac-11eb-8a9a-269ca8350d68.jpeg)\r\n\r\n@misaochan @sivaraam Please review this\r\nNeed help?

You know after we migrated to new UI our fragment hierarchy is changed. \r\nNormally we had ExploreActivity, BookmarksActivity etc. \r\n\r\nNow we have MainActivity and inside ConstibutionsFragments, ExploreFragments etc.\r\n\r\nLets talk about ExploreFragment whcih has two child fragments as MobileImagesListFragment and FeaturedImagesListFragment. When one of the item from lists is selected we should display MediaDetailsFragment. So the structure is\r\n```\r\nMainActivity\r\n|-------------------->ExploreFragment\r\n                                  |-------------->MobileImagesListFragment\r\n                                  |-------------->FeaturedImagesListFragment\r\n                                  |-------------->MediaDetailsFragment\r\n```\r\nI used hide/show/add instead of replace fragment (to retain the list state and for efficiency). But the problem is our newly added visible fragment doesn't gain the focus. Do you have any suggestions?",

However, I did not change the string names, e.g., `menu_option_archived` was not changed to `menu_option_read`. Doing this would require changes in many files, so I'm not sure if it's necessary. In case it is better to change the string names too, please let me know and I will make those changes.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots (for UI changes only)**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44764339/77163398-ff2cef00-6ad3-11ea-96dd-6fb2215e652c.png)",

Then I implemented the `setAppLanguage` method in the `MainActivity` which changes the resource configuration, and hence, the preferred language's `strings.xml` file is used.

Upgrading the Android Gradle plugin will remove this warning (see known issues under https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/releases/tag/robolectric-4.0.2), however I think this is best done when updating Gradle (#2824) or as a separate PR.\r\n\r\n**Tests performed (required)**\r\n\r\nTested `betaDebug` on API level `28`\r\nAll unit tests pass",

    "body": "**Description (required)**\r\n\r\nWhy we are replacing `MediaWikiImageView` (which extends `SimpleDraweeView`) with `SimpleDraweeView`? \r\n\r\n- `MediaWikiImageView` takes a filename and does an API call to fetch its thumbnail using an API call ie `findThumbnailByFilename ` and then maintains a  filename to thumbnail URL cache. \r\n\r\nAs the behavior of fetching the thumbnail was part of the view itself, the thumbnail is fetched every time the view is rendered(if not already in the cache). That results in an extra API call being made for every single image. \r\n\r\nNow, as the app is consuming the `imageinfo` API, we already have the thumbnail URL for most of the images ie explore, search, POTD and media detail. Only contribution list doesn't have thumbnail as of now. If we implement #2904, even the contribution list will have thumbnail beforehand. Until then contribution view holder can fetch and display the thumbnail. \r\n\r\nFixes #2898\r\n\r\nHow? \r\n\r\nEarlier `MediaWikiImageView` was used in media detail and as per the behaviour of `MediaWikiImageView`, it was showing thumbnails. \r\n\r\nFixes #2820\r\n\r\nHow? \r\n\r\nThe change in `appendMediaProperties` automatically gets 640 width thumbs for all media. This is in addition to the original url. \r\n\r\nFixes #2907\r\n\r\nHow? \r\n\r\nUsing Fresco's image controller, we are loading low and res images to a simple drawee view. ",

This PR simply adds a wrapper to simplify the usage of preferences. The refactoring addresses the following issues: \r\n\r\n- many places were using `SharedPreferences` directly, calling `PreferenceManager` multiple times. \r\n- every edit required getting an instance of the editor and call `apply()` or `commit()` manually. \r\n- eliminates the chances of someone forgetting to `apply()` or `commit()`. \r\n- ability to store complex objects without much boilerplate. \r\n- will simplify the handling of `SharedPreferences` store instances\r\n\r\nThis is the first step toward improving shared preferences. With this in place, we would be in a better position to take up the IEG grant task(if approved) for \"Consolidate our multiple SharedPreferences databases into one\". \r\n\r\nWhat changes did you make and why?\r\n\r\nHave added 2 wrapper classes to provide instances of shared prefs. \r\n- `BasicKvStore`\r\n- `JsonKvStore`\r\n\r\nThese classes handle all the logic for talking with `SharedPreferences`. Anyone trying to use shared prefs can do it using simple interfaces: \r\n\r\n```\r\nBasicKvStore store = new BasicKvStore(context, \"storeName\");\r\n\r\nPut string value:\r\nstore.putString(\"test\", \"Hello world\");\r\n\r\nGet String value:\r\nString value = store.getString(\"test\");\r\n```\r\nSimiliarly JsonKvStore can be used for complex objects: \r\n\r\n```\r\nJsonKvStore store = new JsonKvStore(context, \"storeName\");\r\n\r\nPut Json value: \r\n\r\nPlace place = new Place(); //assume you have an instance of place object\r\nstore.putJson(\"test\", place)\r\n\r\nGet Json value: \r\n\r\nPlace place = store.getJson(\"test\", Place.java)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will update the wiki with usage instructions if and when the PR is landed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tests performed (required)**\r\n\r\nWIP",

This makes more sense conceptually, and also allows `CategoryImagesActivity` to handle being called without a specific category.\r\n- Added a method in `CategoryImagesActivity` so it can be called without a specific category, in which case it will open with the featured images category on prod (same as previous behaviour). On beta it will open the category for images uploaded with the Android app (there is no equivalent of featured images on beta).

I have no idea why, and worked enough to understand. A fresh eye would be great. \r\n- I disabled manually swipe and change page option of view pager.

Now location for images uploaded from web and mobile had different formats for an example see \r\nOne uploaded from the app:\r\n    {{Location|12.958117388888889|77.6440805}}\r\nOne uploaded from elsewhere:\r\n{{Location dec|47.99081|7.845416|heading:255.9}}\r\n\r\nClearly an exact string match for string Location would show null results for the later. So added contains instead of equals to solve the same. \r\n## Tests performed (required)\r\n\r\nTested on {27 & Samsung s7}, with {ProdDebug}.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots showing what changed (optional)\r\n \r\n![device-2018-08-21-232201](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17375274/44419572-37d3b200-a599-11e8-839b-e7a7ff4fa02b.png)\r\n\r\n{Only for user interface changes, otherwise remove this section.

These commits implement two different settings for removing certain EXIF rags from the picture and for reducing the accuracy or completely eliminating geolocation data from the picture.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the anonymization logic is implemented in FileProcessor to prevent code reuse. The existing coordinate extraction logic in MultipleShareActivity is also replaced by a FileProcessor to further reduce code reuse.\r\n\r\nAdd method anonymizeCoord() that reduces the resolution of GPS coordinates. Think of each coordinate as a pixel. This function reduces the resolution of \"the world\" to one coordinate(pixel) for every x kilometres (x is the variable prefLocationAccuracy). This approach was chosen over changing the coordinates by a random amount because with that approach; if a user uploads sufficiently many pictures from the same location, statistical analysis can reveal the real location of the user. \r\n\r\nThe Android support library com.android.support:exifinterface was added as some required features are lacking from earlier Android versions.\r\n\r\nAs a minor detail, strings.xml was standardized to 4 spaces per tab. That's why there are so many removed lines.\r\n\r\n## Tests performed (required)\r\n\r\nTested on API 22 Genymotion Google Nexus 5 emulator, with build variant, BetaDebug and ProdDebug.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots showing what changed (optional)\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7621539/42709647-d424fe44-86e9-11e8-95bd-6de48f231621.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7621539/42709669-df1740dc-86e9-11e8-89f9-a3fdd435d7d6.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7621539/42709675-e807321a-86e9-11e8-897b-10d78588011c.png)\r\n",

Tested by uploading via app and \"share\" on prodDebug build, real device running Android 7.0.\r\n\r\nChanges made:\r\n- ~~Directed all upload entry points to ShareActivity. MultipleShareActivity.java will be removed completely in a future PR~~ This redirection cannot be done yet if we are to release 2.8 with this PR.\r\n- Added Javadocs to methods of ShareActivity\r\n- Reduced number of lines in ShareActivity from 1000+ to 600+ by extracting file processing functions to FileProcessor.java (if they made sense to be associated with an object) or to FileUtils.java (if they made sense to be static), and extracting zoom functions to Zoom.java.\r\n- Unified the FileUtils in Upload package and the FileUtils in Utils package, as there is no point in having 2 different FileUtils and it was causing a lot of confusion\r\n- Simplified permission logic in ShareActivity, there is no point having storage permissions requested in the snackbar as well as at the Submit button, as it is mandatory. The snackbar is now used solely for the optional Location permission\r\n- Removed as much unnecessary code as possible from onCreate(), reducing number of lines by more than half",

Now the app would be using both `NETWORK_PROVIDER` for coarse location and `GPS_PROVIDER` for finer location. Upon receiving a location update, it will determine if the newer location is better than the last location. If it is, the newer location would be used. \r\n\r\nAlso fixes #982.",

The popup is basically a warning since the user can choose to ignore it and continue uploading the image. \r\n\r\nAs for the image processing part,  detecting images that are too dark works quite flawlessly as per my testing. I have never come across an image that was pointed out as being too dark incorrectly or vice versa. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while blurry images detection works well enough, the results become less consistent for images taken during the night and/or in poor lighting. It isn't that it fails every time, just that every now and then you will run into an image which looks sharp but was marked as blurry by the app. I have tweaked and played with the configuration quite a lot with the current setup working best for me. However I am not completely convinced. \r\n\r\nThat said, having worked on it for quite a while, I felt best to put the code out for others to see. Maybe having some fresh eyes could lead to changes/improvements.   \r\n\r\nP.S: I have added the OpenCV library to the repository as part of this pull request. However I found [this](https://github.com/jlhonora/opencv-android-sample/blob/master/.gitignore) gitignore file that suggests excluding the library from the repository. This will need to be discussed. \r\n\r\nAlso we will definitely need to add a section in the Wiki about setting up OpenCV.",

As it was licensed under\r\nGPLv2 while this porject is licensed under an Apache license a license\r\nconflict arose.\r\n\r\nTo solve it move the main document which might be susceptible to\r\nlicense issues to the wiki while keeping a jist of it in the\r\ndocument itself.\r\n\r\n* contributing: use lenient wording for steps that might be optional\r\n\r\nIt's not possible to write tests for all changes. For example, UI\r\nchanges. Also, it's not the case that the Wiki pages become stale all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nSo, use lineant wordings for optional steps\r\n\r\n* contributing: correct grammar in a sentence\r\n\r\n\"documented in\" reads better than \"documented at\" (at least for\r\nme).\r\n\r\nIf this is wrong then we can revert it.\r\n\r\n* contributing: add link to guidelines in the wiki page\r\n\r\n* contributing: replace 'jist' with 'gist'\r\n\r\n  \"Jist is a pronunciation spelling of the word just when spoken\r\n   with an American Southern accent.\r\n\r\n   Gist is a noun that means a quick summary or the main point of\r\n   something.\"\r\n\r\nI intended to use the latter.

Incrementing time by 0.2s is not visible to the user, so it doesn‚Äôt impact UX.\r\n2. adding sorting results by string similarity - I used [java-string-similarity](https://github.com/tdebatty/java-string-similarity) library with a Levenshtein algorithm to implement this. There are some tests write for sorting, so you can check how it works.\r\n\r\nHowever, because of a limited number of results from API, this fix is not 100% correct - there can be better results for user inputs that are on the next pages of this request, so this solution only improves search for what we already get from API.",

In the English `strings.xml` I replaced \"Wikimedia Commons\" with a placeholder and added a separate string holding the trademarked name.  I added a method to `HtmlTextView.java` so the html string could be updated programmatically (without being set to the raw text).  In `AboutActivity.java` I added code to set the the license text. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm very unclear on how the translation process works.  For example, is marking the trademarked string with `translatable=\"false` (i.e. `<string name=\"trademarked_name\" translatable=\"false\">Wikimedia Commons</string>`) sufficient?  How do I document the fact that the `about_license` string has changed and needs translation?  \r\n\r\nI appreciate any feedback.",

I believe that `SchemeRegistry` has been been removed in the newest API levels and the gradle flag `useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'` gets around the problem for production code, but Robolectric is being strict in its emulation of the API level in the tests.  Although `ApacheHttpClientMediaWikiApiTest` was annotated to pin it to API 21, `NearbyAdapterFactoryTest` was not so I think the highest API level (recently changed to 25 in `gradle.properties`) was winning.  I ran the tests on the command line with gradle and inside Android Studio and they were green with this tweak.  Hopefully it fixes #783 (Travis build error)!",

    "body": "The goal was to take one operation - updating my upload count on `ContributionsActivity` - and implement it using Rx, swapping out Java Futures and Guava in the process.  \r\n\r\nThis provided a nice showcase for targeted use of Kotlin as I wanted to make use of Lambdas to clean up the code.  By extracting a _presenter_ I was able to migrate just a small portion of the `ContributionsActivity` to Kotlin and not the entire class.  Hopefully this demonstrates a strategy that allows the move to Kotlin to be a step-by-step measured migration over time.\r\n\r\nThis relates to 2 issues:\r\n* #747 - Evaluate usage of kotlin in the project \r\n* #662 - Introducing Guava library to the project\r\n\r\n## Before\r\n### ContributionsActivity\r\n```java\r\nprivate void setUploadCount() {\r\n    UploadCountClient uploadCountClient = new UploadCountClient();\r\n    CommonsApplication application = CommonsApplication.getInstance();\r\n    ListenableFuture<Integer> future = uploadCountClient\r\n            .getUploadCount(application.getCurrentAccount().name);\r\n    Futures.addCallback(future, new FutureCallback<Integer>() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onSuccess(Integer uploadCount) {\r\n            getSupportActionBar().setSubtitle(getResources()\r\n                    .getQuantityString(R.plurals.contributions_subtitle,\r\n                            uploadCount,\r\n                            uploadCount));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onFailure(@NonNull Throwable t) {\r\n            Timber.e(t, \"Fetching upload count failed\");\r\n        }\r\n    }, ExecutorUtils.uiExecutor());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### UploadCountClient \r\n```java\r\npublic class UploadCountClient {\r\n    private ThreadPoolExecutorService threadPoolExecutor;\r\n\r\n    public UploadCountClient() {\r\n        threadPoolExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutorService.Builder(\"bg-pool\")\r\n                .setPoolSize(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors())\r\n                .setExceptionHandler(new BackgroundPoolExceptionHandler())\r\n                .build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static final String UPLOAD_COUNT_URL_TEMPLATE =\r\n            \"https://tools.wmflabs.org/urbanecmbot/uploadsbyuser/uploadsbyuser.py?user=%s\";\r\n\r\n    public ListenableFuture<Integer> getUploadCount(final String userName) {\r\n        final SettableFuture<Integer> future = SettableFuture.create();\r\n        threadPoolExecutor.schedule(new Runnable() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                URL url;\r\n                try {\r\n                    url = new URL(String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, UPLOAD_COUNT_URL_TEMPLATE,\r\n                            new PageTitle(userName).getText()));\r\n                    HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\r\n                    try {\r\n                        BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new\r\n                                InputStreamReader(urlConnection.getInputStream()));\r\n                        String uploadCount = bufferedReader.readLine();\r\n                        bufferedReader.close();\r\n                        future.set(Integer.parseInt(uploadCount));\r\n                    } finally {\r\n                        urlConnection.disconnect();\r\n                    }\r\n                } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                    Timber.e(\"Error getting upload count Error\", e);\r\n                    future.setException(e);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        return future;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## After\r\n### ContributionsActivity\r\n_Note:_ not only do we have Java code calling Kotlin but the Java class is implementing an interface (`ContributionsView`) that was written in Kotlin.\r\n```java\r\npresenter.getUploadCount(this, CommonsApplication.getInstance().getCurrentAccount().name);\r\n```\r\n### ContributionsPresenter\r\n_Note:_ we have Kotlin calling back to Java - all one happy family :)\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass ContributionsPresenter(private val mwApi: MediaWikiApi) {\r\n    private var uploadCountDisposable: Disposable? = null\r\n\r\n    fun dispose() {\r\n        uploadCountDisposable?.dispose()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fun getUploadCount(view: ContributionsView, username: String) {\r\n        uploadCountDisposable = mwApi.getUploadCount(username)\r\n                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())\r\n                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())\r\n                .subscribe({ count -> view.showUpdateCount(count) })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### ApacheHttpClientMediaWikiApi\r\nThe core functionality of `UploadCountClient` moved pretty much as-is.  Instead of wrapping a Future around the operation, the code opts to wrap it in an Rx `Single` indicating that this is a single-shot operation that will emit a single successful result or a failure (rather than a stream of values that you would get from an `Observable`)\r\n```java\r\npublic Single<Integer> getUploadCount(final String userName) {\r\n    return Single.create(new SingleOnSubscribe<Integer>() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void subscribe(@NonNull SingleEmitter<Integer> emitter) throws Exception {\r\n            URL url;\r\n            try {\r\n                url = new URL(String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, UPLOAD_COUNT_URL_TEMPLATE,\r\n                        new PageTitle(userName).getText()));\r\n                HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\r\n                try {\r\n                    BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new\r\n                            InputStreamReader(urlConnection.getInputStream()));\r\n                    String uploadCount = bufferedReader.readLine();\r\n                    bufferedReader.close();\r\n                    emitter.onSuccess(Integer.parseInt(uploadCount));\r\n                } finally {\r\n                    urlConnection.disconnect();\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (Throwable e) {\r\n                Timber.e(\"Error getting upload count\", e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Second example\r\nGetting uploads was a very small example.  Another example would be the file duplicate check that happens in the `ShareActivity` - the large AsncTask plus callbacks (about 120 or so lines of code) in the activity can be replaced with code that is about 1/3 the size.",

I used the `MockWebServer` (from OkHttp) to serve up canned responses and assert that requests are well formed at a unit-test level.  This was already a transitive dependency from the mapbox library, made explicit in the `build.gradle` file.\r\n\r\nMy refactor pulls all of the API calls into a single place so that the body of the app depends on a `MediaWikiApi` interface returning application specific models, with a concrete `ApacheHttpClientMediaWikiApi` class that hides the implementation.  This makes the code more _testable_ (isolating the networking tests to a single class) and makes it easier to use mocks in the rest of the app if you want to unit test just the interactions later.\r\n\r\nAlthough the testing isn't yet complete, I wanted to get the code into your hands as (IMO) it forms a solid basis to address your high-priority item #705 (upload tests).  This PR doesn't include those tests, but it does aim to _set you up for success_ in this endeavor.  :)",

Because we carried upload buttons from action bar to a cell in gridview, if user go down, then she needs to come back all the way up to upload something.\r\n\r\n- The solution of mine is adding a floating button to the right bottom corner to go top. \r\n\r\n2. It looks nice in this orientation, but what if user decides to use phone horizontal? Then there needs to be 4 cells per row (because 2 is too big for vertical), consequently the short side of the notification rectangle will be next to the one of square images. It would look like : \r\n![device-2017-06-02-170912](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3127881/26729529/8e697fb0-47b6-11e7-9f55-eccdb7815ca1.png)\r\nSome possible solutions that I can imagine:\r\n\r\n- Use 2 rows for both vertical and horizontal\r\n- Use squares instead of rectangles when orientation is horizontal (my vote goes to this)\r\n\r\n3. If there is no notification, and we decide to use rectagle shaped upload button area, then we have the same problem. Possible solutions:\r\n\r\n- Never remove notification area, even if there is no notification, we can put \"You dont have any notifications\" (this option would be mush easier)\r\n- When there is no notification, remove notification area and make upload area square as other grid cells. \r\n\r\nƒ∞deas?\r\n\r\n",

Also have updated SingleUploadFragment and Utils to work better, and use new arrays.xml.\r\n\r\nI think the most controversial change is requiring Utils helper methods to be passed a context. This is to access the strings so we don't duplicate stuff e.g. creating `Licenses` in `Prefs.java` - there's already so many similar string names, we don't need more!\r\n\r\nAs this is quite a big change affecting a large number of files I think it's best if it is approved by at least 2 people before it's merged.\r\n\r\nA quick explanation of what I've done:\r\n- Removed `Licenses` constant in Prefs, prefer using `arrays.xml` (which in turn inherits from `strings.xml`)\r\n- Move most of the code in SettingsActivity into SettingsFragment, and remove code no longer needed to force an ActionBar\r\n- setOnPreferenceChangeListener's on the spinner to update the summary as before, and recreate the activity to update the theme straight away when changed\r\n- Tidy up Utils, remove code blocks for API levels < 11 (current minSdkVersion is 15)\r\n- Require context to be passed to Utils to compare strings\r\n- Update SingleUploadFragment to not duplicate values again, use `arrays.xml` instead (which in turn inherits from `strings.xml`). May be an idea to move large if block getting license shorthand from name from SingleUploadFragment to Utils.\r\n- Move \"Become a beta tester\" link in settings to bottom\r\n\r\nPlease do ask any questions about anything else, will either help spot potential bugs or you'll be able to maintain it easier later :)",

Because of this the current implementation is to provide an option to the user via a snackbar to additionally give storage+location permissions, which allows the app to extract extra metadata when uploading. What's strange is that it must be possible without these permissions as a test upload I did included all the EXIF data when I gave the app no permissions, so we could change to extract it out of that.\n\nHowever we should consider if we want to force the user to give storage rights as otherwise often (it seems a bit random) the date is not added. Alternatively we could supply a date field?\n\nAlso I have tested this on my phone (running 6.0.1), and a range of emulators however I don't have a physical device with API<=20 to test it on atm, so it would be good if someone could check before this is merged :)\n\nAlso fixed a very small bug when testing, so incorrect password error is correctly recognised (WrongPluginPass).\n\nEDIT - meant API <= 22\n",
