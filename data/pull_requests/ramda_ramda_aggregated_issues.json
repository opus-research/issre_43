      "https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/1067\r\n\r\nI'm in favor of this, but maybe not before 1.0",
      "TLDR: You can shoot yourselves in the foot with JavaScript, why not with Ramda too?\n\nI just found #2580 which dealt basically with the same problem 6 years ago. That is really upsetting.\n\nThat PR got bikeshedded discussing the incompatibility of `R.equals` (which ignores key order) and a possible `R.reduce` for `Object` (which would observe key order and lead to different results unless the reducer function is commutative and associative).\nPretty everyone agreed that key order does not matter in Object, and that its not an issue traversing `Object` but the PR was never merged.\n\nI guess people have moved on, since still today I cannot traverse a dictionary `Object` — which is pretty basic when you work with Maybe, Either and such data types.\n\nSo if PRs don't cut it, perhaps Ramda has hit an implicit barrier in supporting certain FP features?\n\nThe low entry barrier and no hand-holding attitude have been always the strengths of Ramda: You can solve problems quickly using\n- JS-native data structures,\n- suitable ADTs with Fantasyland support or not,\n- even the pesky `Promise`.\n\nout of personal frustration:\nI think the fact, that Ramda will probably never reach `v1.0` just reflects the fact that one can never fulfill all what is promised  in those \"FP using JavaScript\" articles?",
      "I hear you. As I said and as I argued in those earlier threads, I 100% think we should add Traversable for objects. But it does not feel right to me to have it 1.0, and I worry we'll get into another endless bikeshed if we try.\r\n\r\nBut we'll get to 1.0, and I think soon. I like getting `flow` in for it. Whatever else is on main. Do a v0.30. Then do v1.0 shortly after. The work @Harris-Miller is leading on the typescript side is phenomenal and deserves our continued vigilance here.",
      "🤔\r\n\r\nPlain objects are inherently treated as Functors for `map()` and as Filterables for `filter()`. Are they foldable? Represented as an array via `toPairs()` they are. ~~If we were to add inherent support to `reduce` for objects it would essentially be `compose(reduce, toPairs)` since you'd have to represent it as a key/value tuple pair.~~ (Update: Nevermind, that doesn't make sense, you can't use reducer callback interchangeably between object and arrays then. It would just be the value. If you want the key/value tuple, just use `toPairs` first). And given that you could implement both `map()` and `filter()` from that... I would say yes, objects are foldable. Plain objects have an `empty` (`{}`) and `concat` (`Object.assign`). And via inherent support from `ramda`, implement `equals` as well.\r\n\r\nSeems reasonable to give the same support for Traversables, IMO\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [Data.Map](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.7/docs/Data-Map-Internal.html#t:Map) implements Traversable and it does exactly what is being asked here"

      "This seems a useful and well-written PR.  These sound like useful additions.\r\n\r\nDo others have objections?",
      "Feels a bit niche to me? Considering we can write `R.sortWith([(a, b) => a.localeCompare(b)], xs)`. Also the implementation takes away our ability to call `localeCompare` with our own arguments.. why are we setting `{ numeric: true }` for the options?",
      "Thanks for the feedback. Before implementing I was looking up what natural sort order is supposed to do, and by definition in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order) it is\r\n\r\n> the ordering of strings in alphabetical order, except that multi-digit numbers are treated atomically, i.e., as if they were a single character\r\n\r\nSo for the most intuitive usage (I thought) I had set `{ numeric: true }` with no `locales` option set. If users needed different options, there would be `sortWith` as mentioned. But \"alphabetical order\" has a different meaning based on language. So for more flexibility, should we be able to pass the `locales` and `options` parameters of `localeCompare`?",
      "Just to revive this proposal, I'd like to add my opinion here too.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly it's \"a bit niche\", it fixes sorting text with Ramda. Which is great because `<`, `>` comparisons — as `ascend` and `descent` perform — do not make sense with text.\r\n\r\nIf `localCompare` had been around longer, from the beginning `ascend` and `descent` could have used `String.localCompare` when given `String` items.\r\n\r\nInstead of introducing those two new comparator functions, can you imagine, to change the implementation of `ascend` and `descent` for `String`?\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem is the [customization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator/Collator#locales). To sort according to the browser or Node.js locale (language) might be not target-oriented in most cases. I'd suggest to allow to pass at least the *language* to `localCompare`.\r\n\r\nSo that in this case \r\n```javascript\r\nconst\r\n  collectionItemComparator = ascendNatural(identity);\r\nsort(collectionItemComparator('de'), x)\r\n```\r\n \r\nOr should the language come as first argument instead? I.e. is it the least changing argument? `sort(ascendNatural('de', identity), x)`?",
      "> Admittedly it's \"a bit niche\", it fixes sorting text with Ramda. Which is great because `<`, `>` comparisons — as `ascend` and `descent` perform — do not make sense with text.\r\n\r\nYa and niche was not the right word, ramda could have a better story for sorting by string.\r\n\r\nI like language first.\r\n\r\nShould this be called `localeAscend` and `localeDescend`? Something that immediately implies we are targeting strings here feels appropriate.\r\n\r\n@sebbayer sorry for the slow review! Could you add `@see` references to these new functions from `ascend` and `descend`?",

      "Thanks for the good discussion, let me address some points:\r\n>  Ramda is about functional composition. Combining that in the library with function application confuses its mission.\r\n\r\nMy use case is to set up event driven workflows using reactive *lazy* streams, promises, futures, bla bla bla …\r\nThose \"workflows\" are usually functions, which get *executed* elsewhere using something like `fork` or `runEffects` which — of course — are not part of Ramda.\r\n```javascript\r\n// :: Stream Either String\r\nconst loginWorkflow = pipe(\r\n  () => clickEventStream('#loginButton'),\r\n  samples(inputChangeEventStream('#passwordTextField')),\r\n  chain(pwd => fetch(`https://myapi/login?pwd=${pwd}`)),\r\n  map(response => response.ok ? Right(response): Left(new Error())),\r\n  tap(either(paintError, paintSuccess)),\r\n  map(map(prop('accessToken'))\r\n)();\r\nconst uploadWorkflow = pipe(\r\n  () => clickEventStream('#uploadButton'),\r\n  samples(loginWorkflow),\r\n  chain(token => fetch(\"https://myapi/upload?${token}\"),\r\n// …\r\n)();\r\n// Up to now nothing gets executed. The workflows itself are functions …\r\n// This runs both workflows (function execution)\r\nrunEffects(uploadWorkflow)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it is really composing functions which disguise as lazy promises or streams. In my understanding I am not *applying* values setting up the pipelines.\r\n\r\nMy motivation for this PR is selfish and of *syntactic* nature: \r\nI really hate writing and reading `pipe(() => …)()` or `applyTo(… , pipe(…))`, when `flow(…)` (or maybe `flow(…, […])`) seems sufficient.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should've mentioned this earlier. This is also the reason I linked to the related [`|>` proposal ](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator); many think there is a need to improve the language.\r\n\r\n>> For personal reasons, I don't like the extra [] syntactic noise.\r\n\r\n>I like the noise, it alerts readers (we read code more than write it!) that something is different between first and second args.\r\n\r\nI can follow that argument: That array includes only unary functions. Even if I consider the argument weak: Most Ramda functions need different arguments based on their position. \r\n\r\n> A few years ago, [I wrote](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/2789#issuecomment-466720359):\r\n\r\n>>But the goal is after v1.0 to move pipe and compose to match this, and to stop shipping any variadic functions.\r\n>> … \r\n>> But I would like it if all Ramda functions had fixed arities; this to my mind makes it easier to think about them. \r\n\r\n>I still think that would be great\r\n\r\n@CrossEye I still don't and I would not want to lay the basis for that change with `flow(x, [fns])`\r\n\r\n- learning `o(f, g) ≡ f ∙ g` which is fine and fundamental, one concludes that `f ∙ g ∙ h` would be `o(f, g, h)` or `compose(f, g, h)`. In `compose([f, g, h])` the need for an array after 2 arguments comes as a surprise.\r\n- The last function in `compose` and the first in `pipe` may be (n>1)-ary functions. So they don't quite fit.\r\n- this breaks *all* my source files\r\n\r\n> On the contrary, the whole rationale for applyTo is to handle the case where the transformation function is the data.\r\n\r\nI did not get that yet, give me some time to think about your example.\r\n\r\n> I would stay far away from the name flow. I'm sure we can find something less confusing.\r\n\r\nYes, I agree!\r\n\r\nTo align with the status-quo I'd even consider swapping the names.

      "> Maybe I should've mentioned this earlier. This is also the reason I linked to the related [`|>` proposal ](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator); many think there is a need to improve the language.\r\n\r\nAnd that's what I was mostly reacting to.  Pipe proposals have a [long, sad history][ph].  I really preferred the F#-style ones, which have now basically been abandoned, and am much less impressed with the Hack-style ones.  But what I wanted most of all is `compose`/`pipe` *operators*, which doesn't seem to have a real chance.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen your usage before.  Am I understanding correctly that this is designed to do something like what RxJs or Bacon does? \r\n\r\n> Also I don't want to put the seed `x` in the end `pipe(f, g, h)(x)`, because `x` is far away from `f` and thus your eyes have to jump up and down reading the code.\r\n\r\nYes, I always prefer named functions here (`foo = pipe(f, g, h); foo(x)`), but I can understand that's not for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n>> On the contrary, the whole rationale for `applyTo` is to handle the case where the transformation function is the data.\r\n\r\n> I did not get that yet, give me some time to think about your example.\r\n\r\nIt didn't help that I mixed Ramda and Array.prototype syntaxes.  That really should have been\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmap(applyTo(10))([add(5), multiply(3), inc, dec]) //=> [15, 30, 11, 9]\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmap(applyTo(10), [add(5), multiply(3), inc, dec]) //=> [15, 30, 11, 9]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe point here is that this is a counterpart to `call`/`apply`.  When used curried, `call` and `apply` treat a transformation function as something that we want to bake in, and then to which we later want to apply some value.  `applyTo` treats some value as what we want to bake in; later we'll apply some function(s) to that value.  I always discourage people from describing Ramda as \"data-last\"; rather, \"the parameters more likely to change come after those less likely.\"  So with `applyTo`, we're thinking of the integer value, `10` as the static thing, not likely to change, while the function varies.\r\n\r\n\r\n> To align with the status-quo I'd even consider swapping the names. (Has anybody an idea where \"flow\" and \"pipe\" originate?)\r\n\r\nI came up with `pipe`, as I thought `pipeline` both too long and noun-y.  I don't recall if I considered `flow`, but I still prefer `pipe`: `flow` feels focused on the data running through, where `pipe` is about how the functions are connected.  But I guess if you read `pipe` as a noun, then it's not very compelling.  I always think of it as a verb.\r\n\r\nLodash saw Ramda as a competitor, and aimed to kill it by duplicating its core features.  (More charitably, lodash saw how awesome some Ramda ideas were.  But I'm not feeling particularly charitable today.)  But for whatever reason, they didn't like the name `pipe` and called it `flow`, which is ok.  They also named their version of `compose` as `flowRight`, which is horrible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [ph]: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/blob/main/HISTORY.md\r\n",

      "@CrossEye Thanks for your input — that helped me again to think about my motivation with this function \"flow\"!\r\n\r\nI've revised this PR, so that the proposed function has now a fixed arity and is binary-auto-curried. \r\n`flow :: a → [(a → b), …, (y → z)] → z` This should address the greatest concern of avoiding variadic functions.\r\n\r\nI made the description quite wordy, and may need help with the correct formulation.\r\n> `flow` is helps to avoid introducing named functions with named arguments\r\nfor computing the result of a function pipeline which depends on given initial values.\r\nRather than composing a custom pipeline function `p = (_x, _y) => R.pipe(g(_x), h(_y), …)`\r\nwhich is only later needed once `z = p(x, y)`,\r\nthe introduction of `p`, `_x` and `_y` can be avoided: `z = flow(x, [g, h(y),…]`\r\n\r\nI also changed the example to be more suitable.\r\n\r\nWe'd still need to agree on a name other than \"flow\". \r\n\r\nApart from that — are there any other concerns I should address? \r\n\r\n@CrossEye Concerning your last remarks:\r\n> I haven't seen your usage before.

Nowadays I prefer [@most/core](https://mostcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which is a little less surprising because there are just lazy streams (except when explicitly stated). That pipelines I construct using \"flow\" are basically just event listeners glued together. \r\n \r\nI agree with you on all other points. Especially that the JS pipe proposal is doomed since it will be not the F# flavour. \r\n\r\nHeck — maybe I will be lucky one day and write [F# for the browser](https://fable.io) 🤞🏻 \r\n\r\n",

This type behavior can be combined with the usage of functions like `head`, which can be overloaded to know the difference, allowing for a strict return type of `T` instead of `T | undefined`. And that, is invaluable \r\n\r\nHere is a full example in the [Typescript Playground](https://tsplay.dev/NlX7lN)\r\n\r\nI'll eventually have an MR in types-ramda to compliment this one with full typings as demo'd in the playground link",

      "@kedashoe At work today, a dev of mine harmlessly switched an instance of `isEmpty` in our code from being imported from `lodash` to `ramda`\r\n\r\nCaught by a unit test, we found that `lodash.isEmpty` handles `null`/`undefined` differently from `ramda.isEmpty`\r\n* `_.isEmpty(null)` => `true`\r\n* `R.isEmpty(null)` => `false`\r\n\r\nIt makes since to me why `ramda` would want to return `false` there. Because `null`/`undefined` are not \"empty\", they can't be \"empty\" because they don't contain anything to be \"empty\" of\r\n\r\nThat made me realize that this MR has a flaw. In that `isNotEmpty()` is just `!isEmtpy()`, for the case of `null`/`undefined` it is incorrect. `isNotEmpty(null)` should also return `false`\r\n\r\nThe best analogy I have for this is that `isEmpty(null) === false` AND `isNotEmpty(null) === false` in the same way that `5 < 5 === false` AND `5 > 5 === false`\r\n\r\nBefore I trhow up a second MR, was hoping to get some feedback on my assertion",

All the `has*` functions too – I guess – because they serve a related purpose.\r\n\r\nIn Ramda, the name \"prop\" refers to an established mental image/concept which is of great benefit when reasoning about code.",
      "I have to agree with @kedashoe , this function already exists as R.path. If we really wanted this functionality, I feel like it would make more sense to upgrade R.path to also support props, as it already is the function that does \"more\"? Or just have a new function that decides whether to call prop or path? \r\n\r\nI also ran a quick benchmark of path and this new prop function, and it runs significantly slower when inputting an array. This is likely due to creating a lot of new functions due to using curried and arrow functions, creating some new arrays in reduce and not exiting when possible. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// inputting arrays for nested values\r\npath arr x 5,773,850 ops/sec ±1.52% (20 runs sampled)\r\nprop arr x   158,810 ops/sec ±0.62% (24 runs sampled)\r\n\r\n// inputting string / [string] to get prop\r\npath str x 4,316,608 ops/sec ±0.88% (23 runs sampled)\r\nprop str x 4,556,412 ops/sec ±0.84% (23 runs sampled)\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

It's really hard to know how people might have taken advantage of it over the years.  Or maybe that's not even possible.  Hmmm....\r\n\r\n@semmel:\r\n\r\n> What about `[1,2,3,4]`?\r\n\r\nYou're right.  That would be another candidate, and in some sense the inverse of `[1, 2, 3, 10]`.  One says, \"Keep any extra parameters the first time they're collected, and include them in the final call\".  The other says, \"Ignore any extra parameters until you hit the final call, and then include them.  And although several times I'd wished we had done `[1, 2, 3]` -- \"Ignore all extra parameters,\" I do think at this point we're better of with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.  The days of defaulted parameters that don't contribute to the arity seems to make this more reasonable.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm in front a computer rather than my mobile phone, I'll test how this PR's code would handle that scenario.

For some reason it takes into account the `es/package.json` file and adding `\"sideEffects\": false` to it changes webpack's behavior.\r\n\r\nAfter deeper investigation I noticed that it doesn't actually add all ramda function to the bundle. However tree-shaking works wrong when the app consists of multiple chunks, and each chunk imports different ramda functions. Without the `sideEffects` flag webpack creates single chunk with all imported ramda functions, and this chunk is imported in all other chunks. With `sideEffects: false` webpack works correctly (each chunk has ramda functions that are imported inside the chuink)\r\n\r\nHere is a repo where you can reproduce the issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/laboskin/ramda-tree-shaking-test\r\n\r\nBuild it once (`npm run build`), then add `sideEffects: false` to `node_modules/ramda/es/package.json` and build it again.

      "This update should make no difference on the Typescript end of things either. The current definition we have is this\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { A } from 'ts-toolbelt';\r\n\r\nexport type Placeholder = A.x & { '@@functional/placeholder': true };\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~I don't know if the `x: Math.random()` came first and the `A.x` was put in to support that, or the other way around. Regardless, I never understood the point of the `A.x &`, as I could not find any value added to the typings for it.~~\r\n\r\n~~See playground example: https://tsplay.dev/Wyjoxw~~\r\n\r\n@CrossEye 's comment below made me re-visit this comment and I realized I made a mistake. The definition for `Placeholder` above, though has `A.x`, actually has nothing to do with the `{ x: Math.random() }` part that is being removed by this MR, it's just a coincidence.\r\n\r\nThe `A.x` part in the type definition is there to represent an arbitrary unique symbol so that the object literal `{ '@@functional/placeholder': true }` isn't accepted. I don't know what I was thinking before about the `A.x` thing not making a difference. It does, see: https://tsplay.dev/wXgL9W\r\n\r\nEither way, this change still doesn't affect the Typescript definition, so no problem from my end.",
      "Note that that existing behavior is there for a reason.  This doesn't mean it's not time to change it, but we should also understand what it's giving up.  I haven't found the relevant discussions yet, but the below should be pretty close:\r\n\r\nWhen we wanted to add a placeholder for obvious reasons in partial application, we didn't want to go down the route that lodash had, using the library itself as the placeholder.  It was an obvious thing to do with Underscore and lodash, where the library was usually exposed using the name `_`.  But it didn't make sense to pass Ramda itself as the placeholder.  In fact, we wanted to go in the opposite direction.  \r\n\r\nWe created a version that was meant to allow for interoperability with other libraries.  The thought was that if users passed any library's placeholder, it should just work.  To make that possible, we treated the placeholder as a protocol, simply used an obscure property, modeled after one for [transducers][tr] and after the language's [iteration prototcols][ip].\r\n\r\nIt was a good idea, I still believe.  However, AFAIK, no one else ever followed this lead.  So I guess it's time to stop waiting for that, and gain the optimization.  Has anyone actually performed benchmarks to see what's gained?\r\n\r\nSo, from me, a reluctant 👍🏼 .\r\n\r\nLet's not forget -- as demonstrated by the need to change a test case -- that this is a breaking change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [ip]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols\r\n  [tr]: https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js?tab=readme-ov-file#transformer-protocol",
      "Thank you @CrossEye for explaining the design of the Ramda placeholder. I had no idea 😮  \r\n\r\nThe idea to *\"allow for interoperability with other libraries\"* is fundamental to Ramda: E.g. you can use any reasonable monad library with Ramda, as it will discover `map` or `fantasy-land/map` (as specified in the Fantasyland protocol) and treat that thing as functor.\r\n\r\nSupporting \"entities\" via *property protocol* is a nice idea:\r\n- It removes the need to implement that entity (placeholder, algebraic data type) in Ramda itself, and\r\n- gives the user the liberty to use an implementation of his own choice.\r\n\r\nDealing with the messy browser DOM in my daily job, I've always struggled processing [property access limited `WindowProxy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#cross-origin_script_api_access) with Ramda. Since `isPlaceholder()` permeates nearly every Ramda function, I always got an \"access denied\" error.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps there will be a more `WindowProxy`-friendly way to annotate a thing as placeholder. Ramda could then support that  \"protocol\" …",

Here it can be just a plain object with a single property `\"fantasy-land/of\"`.\r\nThus `traverse` and `sequence` now have the same signature as their [counterparts in Sanctuary](https://github.com/sanctuary-js/sanctuary#traverse--applicativeftraversablet--typerepf---a-fb---ta---ftb) and their [counterparts in Crocks](https://crocks.dev/docs/functions/pointfree-functions.html).",

Last year, when I created #3041, my use case was the following: given a pageview history page, I needed to filter out duplicate visits from the same user, displaying only the latest one. IMHO this would be the simplest form:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst visits = [\r\n  {\r\n    date: '2021-12-02',\r\n    userId: 1\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    date: '2021-12-01',\r\n    userId: 1\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    date: '2021-11-27',\r\n    userId: 2\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    date: '2021-11-25',\r\n    userId: 1\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst uniqueVisits = R.dropRepeatsBy(R.prop('userId'), visits)\r\nconsole.log(uniqueVisits)\r\n\r\n/*\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    date: '2021-12-02',\r\n    userId: 1\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    date: '2021-11-27',\r\n    userId: 2\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    date: '2021-11-25',\r\n    userId: 1\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Use case is similar to `R.uniqBy`, but only applies to contiguous equalities, just like `R.uniq` vs `R.dropRepeats`.",

      "While I did submit  quick-and-dirty fix, I think yours might actually be better - I think the problem is that transducers are inherently stateful (especially in the step function), they just happen to hide the state under the hood (this being a huge optimization in clojure, or in JS using `ImmutableJS`, since you can use transient mutable versions of your immutable structures to save the overhead while still looking stateless to the outside observer:\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know this codebase super well, but if I had to guess, I think your fix could end up solving similar issues if there are other \"also usable as a transducer\" reductions that aren't being tested in transducer form.\r\n. \r\nThe `step` function in particular is often some kind of state mutation, just bookended betwen the `init` and `result` functions, though in JS this is a bit made up as we go (and tbh ends up being way more complicated to make sense of all the internal indirection you end up with) since clojure gets immutability for free and outright names the mutable versions of its structures \"transients\".\r\n\r\nOther JS implementations of transduce, I usually see this handled by the final transform created by e.g. `into`, where `into([], ...)` \"clones\" the array when it's empty, but if a populated plain object/array is passed in, they just mutate it when plain or else leave it up to a `@@transducer/init` function to take care of things. I don't know what'd be best for ramda, just figured it'd be worth mentioning.",
      "Ok, I'm gonna open the PR because my solution seems more consistent with the no-transducers implementation.\r\n\r\nAfter reading what you say, @jaawerth, I don't like to much the _clone approach we have in functions like `into` and maybe delegating in `@@transducer/init` function is better. But I think it's something that I have to review more deeply. Having the same solution than the default implementation can reduce the number of unexpected behaviours for now.",

      "I spend some time to see the source code of `groupBy`, `reduceBy` and `_xreduceBy` , find out that this fix is more robust.\r\n\r\nWhen using `reduce` and `reduceBy`, People should not mutate the acc in place in general. But `groupBy` has break this rule for performance, and use one hack method to let itself behave normally, as follows:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar groupBy = _curry2(_checkForMethod('groupBy', reduceBy(function(acc, item) {\r\n  if (acc == null) {\r\n    acc = [];\r\n  }\r\n  acc.push(item);\r\n  return acc;\r\n}, null)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen `groupBy` act as a transducer, if `acc` is `null`, this means it's a new subgroup iteration, then `groupBy` make a new empty array `[]` to subgroup, then each subgroup has its own acc.",
      "When I change the source code to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar groupBy = _curry2(_checkForMethod('groupBy', reduceBy(function(acc, item) {\r\n  acc.push(item);\r\n  return acc;\r\n}, [])));\r\n```\r\n\r\n`groupBy` behaves normally when process data directly, but will break as a transducer.\r\n\r\n Because when process data directly, it will `clone(valueAcc, false)`; and when used as a transducer, it does not clone `valueAcc`, all subgroups share the same `valueAcc`.",
      "All other Ramda apis base on `reduceBy` (`countBy`, `indexBy`) don't have this problem, because they do not mutate `acc` in place.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar countBy = reduceBy(function(acc, elem) { return acc + 1; }, 0);\r\n\r\nvar indexBy = reduceBy(function(acc, elem) { return elem; }, null);\r\n```",

      "> I think this is perfectly sensible but I need to get my head around `_dispatchable` as this function seems key in order to conduct a review (at least for me).\r\n\r\nI'm thinking deeply about it and I can say that technically it doesn't depends on `_dispatchable` it's more about how transducers work. Transducer implementations requires:\r\n* transducer creators: functions that return transducers\r\n* transducers: functions that receive a transformer and returns a transformer. They are the functions that can be composed applying a performant way of transformation over  arrays, iterables and so on.\r\n* transformers: objects that implement `@@transducer/init`, `@@transducer/step` and `@@transducer/result` methods.\r\n\r\nBecause of composition of transducers we won't need another way of partial application over transducer creators. Then, it seems we will never need to wrap internal transducer creators with curryX functions.\r\n\r\n> Do you have an idea of how much we gain performance wise?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to check it. I've seen tables with benchmarks in #3048 but I don't know how they were created. Is there a standard way to create benchmarks in this project?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n",

      "> ## But Ramda has _no_ dependencies\r\n\r\nExactly! However I have mixed feeling about this, let's assume that **Ramda** have had dependencies, then I would have made a better argument to NOT have a lockfile because this very file only lives inside the source repo and impacts that repo only, it doesn't represent how end-user consuming its dependencies, thus outdated lockfile could diverge the experience between its lib repo and real-world situation.\r\n\r\n- > Lockfiles for apps, but not for packages. Lockfiles are great for apps where you want a controlled reproducible environment, but for packages this doesn't make much sense. The package-lock.json files in dependencies are ignored, so the lockfile only applies when users run npm install in the package repo. If you use a lockfile for packages, your local dependency tree will not match the dependency tree of users having your package as a dependency. This can potentially cause problems if one of your package dependencies breaks your package in a patch release. The lockfile will prevent you from seeing the problem locally, but it will affect your users. [^1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> ## Using exact version in package.json may have the same effect as what the lock file do?\r\n\r\nYes and no:\r\n\r\n- > The whole \"grab the latest semver compatible version\" was designed for a reason, and just pinning to a specific version would bring us to a world where very different articles need to be written. Specifically, when there's a vulnerability in any dependency (a thing that happens much more often than a rogue OSS dev) the upgrade process would be a nightmare for everyone involved.\r\n  > You have to choose one of the two evils; automatic bug/vulnerability fixes, or protection against rogue OSS devs you depend on. I'd say the former is an order of magnitude more common and important, and so the npm/JS world works this way. [^2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> ## Some malicious actors will target maintainers of popular packages to steal their tokens and publish compromised versions of popular package.\r\n\r\nIt matters to your threat model, in the NPM's security history I bet in 95% of the incidents they were using lockfiles, and what if they were pinned to a bad version and never / delays updated since?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for pulling the leg here, just two days ago I've had PR #3223 submitted, does anyone occur to review the actual diff inside `package-lock.json` and verify its legitimacy?

      "You're not wrong that pinning dependencies or using a lock file makes it less trivial to keep dependencies up to date. That's totally fair but for me that's a win (just my personal opinion here). I'm not of fan of pulling the latest version of everything every single time. It's literally a blank cheque to install whatever on your machines. Effective security in my opinion is about preventing not reacting to threats.\r\n\r\nSome companies actually have that model, all dependencies are carefully vetted before consumed. In the meantime people just stick with pre-approved packages. It may seem inflexible but if the update process is quick, reliable and frequent, this model becomes a very useful barrier against totally preventable security incidents.\r\n\r\nI won't object to removing the lock file. Actually assuming that humans will always review a machine-generated file is a security issue in itself so in a sense you're helping us (and thank you for your contribution) but I would really love to see the dependencies pinned down as a result.\r\n\r\nI am not asking for the dependencies to be updated though. Just for the `package.json` file to be updated to remove `^` and `~` symbols. I think that's an ok compromise don't you think?\r\n\r\nOf course any other maintainers is free to disagree and merge this as it is.\r\n\r\n",

Keep in mind by dropping `package-lock` today you still going to fetch semver compatible versions, not the latest ones, without a major bump they're still outdated heavily.\r\n\r\nCheck again these giants:\r\n\r\n- babel\r\n- rollup\r\n- eslint\r\n- mocha\r\n- js-yaml\r\n- etc...\r\n\r\nif someone or some companies have the secrecy to effectively verify (e.g. `dist/index.min.js`) each upgrades then I'm all ears. And if some how they were compromised by a single version bump, **Ramda** repo is the last place I'd worried about.",
      "I think we should simply agree to disagree here.\r\n\r\nI voiced my concerns and if other maintainers do not share them they are more than welcome to merge your pull request. In any case thank your for your time and contributions, they are well appreciated.",
      "I concur.\r\n\r\n_btw: branch rebased_",
      "Sorry, I want to last time emphasize the security concern on pinning to the exact version.\r\n\r\nAssuming module `foobar` has the following versions:\r\n\r\n- 1.5.0  -- vulnerable resolved\r\n- 1.3.0\r\n- 1.2.0  -- vulnerable introduced\r\n\r\nIn the `package.json` you have:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"foobar\": \"^1.3.0\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a fresh install, you'd fetch the `1.5.0` (semver compatible).\r\n\r\nHowever, by pin to the exact version:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- \"foobar\": \"^1.3.0\"\r\n+ \"foobar\": \"1.3.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn another install, you'd get the version `1.3.0` instead (vulnerable included).\r\n\r\nThis is hardly new knowledge, please be awarded.\r\n",
      "How's this for a process?\r\n\r\n  - Before a major release, we strip out all the dev dependencies, and reinstall them with the latest (non-prerelease) versions,\r\n \r\n    ```shell\r\n    npm install --save-dev --save-exact @babel/cli  @babel/core ... xyz\r\n    ```\r\n    (I'm bothered though about needing another place to track these dependencies, so perhaps we simply pull them first from the current `package.json`.)\r\n\r\n  - Obviously we then run tests and the full build/publish cycle.\r\n\r\n  - Between major versions, when we find the need to change dependency versions, we simply update `package.json` with the latest.  We can release this change on its own in a patch version and/or with other code in a minor version.",

      "Thank you very much for your well-written and well-considered PR.\r\n\r\nWhile I need a little more time to consider this, I do have some serious objections.\r\n\r\nFirst, Ramda is extremely wary of throwing exceptions.  Functions that throw exceptions do not compose well, and improving functional composition is one of the main themes of the library.  Ramda has mostly subscribed to the Garbage In/Garbage Out philosophy.  If you supply what the function is designed to take, then we'll do what's expected.  If you don't, anything might happen.  \r\n\r\nSecond, I'm not happy with introducing `equals` here.  These are so far a very efficient function, and they operate on the JS notion of comparison.  But with `equals`, we're adding a fairly heavy-weight function and we are sometimes precluding the JS comparison.  Moreover, doing this, is a surprising breaking change, and not only for those supplying incompatible types.  [For instance][rr]:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst max2 = (a, b) => {\r\n  if (equals (a, b)) { return a; }\r\n  if (a > b || b > a) { return b > a ? b : a; }\r\n  throw new TypeError('cannot compare ' + toString(a) + ' with ' + toString(b));\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst foo = (id, val) => ({  // or a class or constructor function\r\n  id, \r\n  val, \r\n  equals: (that) => that.id == id, \r\n  valueOf: () => val\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst first = foo ('a', 5)\r\nconst second = foo ('a', 7)\r\n\r\nconsole .log (max (first, second))   //=> {id: \"a\", val: 7}\r\nconsole .log (max2 (first, second))  //=> {id: \"a\", val: 5}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(This has to do with the fact that Ramda's `equals` [delegates to][eq] an `equals` method on the objects if they have one.)\r\n\r\nSo I'm not really happy with this implementation.  But I agree that there is probably something to fix if we can't guarantee that, for instance,  `max (a, b) === max (b, a)`.  So I think *something* should be done.  I haven't yet tried to think about what that is, though.\r\n\r\n \r\n [eq]:https://github.com/ramda/ramda/blob/a1a90ddd34c66d8738598beccbb0d50c3ed9ad99/source/internal/_equals.js#L45-L53\r\n  [rr]: https://tinyurl.com/yglssxtg\r\n\r\n",
      "@CrossEye thanks for the reply - both points make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nI think based on the Garbage In/Garbage Out philosophy, we could probably simplify the scope of the PR, and just check whether both arguments are defined before making the comparison. This was my original use case, where the function being passed `undefined` was causing some unpredictable results.\r\n\r\nI see it less likely that people will try to compare `'a'` to `1`, vs `1` to `undefined`, for example.\r\n\r\nThat would allow us to remove the `equals` function, and only throw an error where we really need to - or possibly even treat `undefined` in the same way as JS treats `null`, which is to treat it like `0` in terms of the comparison operator.\r\n(Not sure about this one, but could be done if we really don't want to throw an error).",
      "@abrwn:  What if we use the four-part logic resulting from `a < b` and `a > b`?  If these differ, return the appropriate value.  If they're both true or both false, then we make a consistent, but arbitrary choice, perhaps the one with the alphabetically earlier \"typeof\" result, and if that fails, the one with the alphabetically earlier result from `R.toString`, and only if that fails, choosing the the first one for `min` and the last one for `max`.  (This last might involve a minor backward incompatibility, but I think it would help if we wanted to use these in any stable sorting algorithm.)\r\n\r\nI thought we might need two `isNaN` checks in there as well, but for NaN, it simply doesn't matter which value we return.\r\n\r\nThis would let us avoid ever throwing, and would defer the heavyweight `toString` call until all other options have been exhausted.\r\n\r\n",

      "@hitmands: \r\n> I would not want this (or any other function in this) library to oversee too much how it's used...\r\n\r\nYes, that's generally been Ramda's philosophy.  I don't really want to change that.  But we do avoid throwing errors as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd even when we say all bets are off when a function is misused, when we can give guarantees about certain features, it would be nice to do so.\r\n\r\nThus, although we've never really stated them, there are laws that I would expect, say, `min` to uphold, even with bad data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor all a, b, c  \r\n    min (a, b) = a  or  min (a, b) = b          (closed)\r\n    min (a, b) = min (b, a)                     (commutative)\r\n    min (a, min (b, c)) = min (min (a, b), c)   (transitive)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR demonstrates that we're violating commutativity (transitivity as well.)  I think we could reasonably fix these functions to avoid that without too much effort.  It cannot be perfect -- it's JS after all -- but it can become at least more consistent.",

The idea is not that you could merge a prototype into a newly created object, but that by altering, say, `Object .prototype`, you can change the behavior of existing objects.\r\n\r\nThe canonical example seems to [look like this][r1]:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst naiveMerge = (a, b) => {\r\n  // Just to illustrate the problem.  But could happen with a real recursive merge\r\n  Object .entries (b) .forEach (([k, v]) => \r\n    Object .keys (v) .forEach (inner => a[k][inner] = v[inner])\r\n  )\r\n  return a                      \r\n}\r\n\r\n// This user has no `isAdmin` field\r\nconst user = {name: 'fred'}\r\nconsole.log(`Before: ${user.isAdmin}`); //=> undefined\r\n\r\n// We get this from some perhaps-untrustworthy source\r\nconst maliciousUserInput = '{\"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}'\r\n// but we're smart enough to sanitize it with\r\nconst ourObject = naiveMerge ({}, JSON.parse(maliciousUserInput)) \r\n// However, naiveMerge adds `isAdmin` to `Object.prototype`, with value `true`\r\n\r\n// And now that same user has `isAdmin` set\r\nconsole.log(`After: ${user.isAdmin}`); //=> true !!!\r\n\r\n// if we call naiveMerge again we get an error.\r\n// But a less naive version might go undetected.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth jQuery and lodash were caught by this.  I don't think it's true for Ramda because of our immutable design.  It [doesn't happen][r2] if we use `R.merge` (or `R.mapObjIndexed`).  But I'm far from certain that it could never happen.  I think this suggests a cleanup where we make sure any place we add properties to a blank object starts with `Object .create (null)` rather than `{}`.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think we need this change just yet.\r\n\r\n  [r1]: https://tinyurl.com/yf6mvbq3\r\n  [r2]: https://tinyurl.com/yhluqjyw",

If you are creating your user account by JSON-parsing something from an untrustworthy source, then they could just as well pass you `'{\"admin\": true}'`.  That they sneak it into the prototype is not a big deal.  But if your sprawling web app uses some third-party API for a trivial bit of fluff and that API is compromised, a true prototype poisoning would mean that your previously secure user object (in JS: ha!) now suddenly can get admin privileges.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not with what happens with this object, but with what it allows on all other objects.\r\n\r\nIt's these sorts of things that I think people are worried about:\r\n\r\n  - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2018-3721\r\n  - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-10744\r\n  - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-11358\r\n\r\nThat's a real worry, and I'm far from certain Ramda doesn't have any such issues.

      "@CrossEye  To continue the `isAdmin` example, the application developer could be using a check for prohibited properties, thus preventing direct injection of `isAdmin: true`. Since the initial object (`hasOwn` in the JSFiddle) doesn't in fact have that property, it would be able to bypass such checks.\r\n\r\nConsidering including \"prototype\" in the check - it is a common practice to account for all 3 properties, as they are known to be exploited in similar scenarios. I agree that in this case it is unnecessary, however I would suggest to keep it in case something changes in the implementation (e.g. recursive version of property assignment).",

Someone who claims that name as a business requirement is probably not being honest.\r\n\r\nI don't want to diminish the issue here.  It's worth discussing.

      "Below is a response I've drafted to send to Veracode.  Does anyone have any suggested improvements?\r\n\r\n@ramda/core \r\n\r\n> Overview\r\n> --------\r\n> \r\n> There seems to be an [erroneous vulnerability report][vr] in Veracode, saying that Ramda is subject to prototype pollution.\r\n> \r\n> While we certainly have not definitively demonstrated that nothing in Ramda has this vulnerability, the examples so far are *not* examples of prototype pollution, only of the ability to create objects that the user didn't know would contain custom prototypes.\r\n> \r\n> It seems like this report should be withdrawn.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Prototype Pollution\r\n> -------------------\r\n> \r\n> Prototype pollution is the ability for crafted input supplied to a generic function to the alter the prototype of built-in JavaScript constructs, such as `Object`.\r\n> \r\n> One example, from a [WhiteSource blog][ws], is: \r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> const getObject = require('getobject');\r\n> var obj = {}; \r\n> var obj2 = 1; \r\n> console.log(\"Before Polluting : \" + obj2.Check);  //~> 'Before Polluting : undefined'\r\n> getObject.set(obj, \"__proto__.Check\", \"polluted\");\r\n> console.log(\"After Polluting: \" + obj2.Check);  //~> 'After Polluting: polluted'\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Another one, closer to the case in question, from a [snyk vulnerability report][sr], looks like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> const mergeFn = require('lodash').defaultsDeep;\r\n> const payload = '{\"constructor\": {\"prototype\": {\"a0\": true}}}'\r\n> \r\n> function check() {\r\n>     mergeFn({}, JSON.parse(payload));\r\n>     if (({})[`a0`] === true) {\r\n>         console.log(`Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via ${payload}`);\r\n>     }\r\n>   }\r\n> \r\n> check(); //~> 'Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via {\"constructor\": {\"prototype\": {\"a0\": true}}}'\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> What these have in common is that calling `getObject.set` or `lodash.defaultsDeep` modifies the prototype of the built-in `Object`, and thus they affect the behavior not just of the resulting object they return but also of any existing JavaScript objects and any newly created ones.  This would allow a malicious user to perform denial-of-service attacks and even perform actions without proper permissions, such as modifying or deleting data in a Node.js application.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> History\r\n> -------\r\n> \r\n> [A Veracode vulnerability report][vr] said:\r\n> \r\n> > ramda is vulnerable to prototype pollution.

It looks like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> const hasOwn = JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\r\n> console.log(hasOwn.isAdmin); //~> undefined\r\n> const mapped = R.mapObjIndexed((val) => val, hasOwn);\r\n> console.log(mapped.isAdmin); //~> true\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Note that `hasOwn` does not have `isAdmin` in its prototype, but `mapped` does have it.\r\n> \r\n> The suggestion is that because of this Ramda's `mapObjIndexed` can cause prototype pollution.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Dispute\r\n> -------\r\n> \r\n> All the top answers on a [search for \"prototype pollution\"][dd] have variants of [the description on codeburst][cb]:\r\n> \r\n> > Prototype Pollution, as the name suggests, is about polluting the prototype of a base object which can sometimes lead to arbitrary code execution.\r\n> \r\n> The above code does not do so.  It does not pollute the base objects.  It simply offers a surprising way to adjust the prototype of one specific object.  And this behavior has little to do with Ramda; it's part of the base language as well.  If we replaced the call to Ramda's `mapObjIndexed` with one to JavaScript's `Object.assign`, we get [the exact same behavior][f2].  As far as I can tell, there is no report out against `Object.assign` for prototype pollution.\r\n> \r\n> Another way to look at it is to view some slight variants of the `snyk` demonstration above for `mergeDeepRight` and `mapObjIndexed`.  [In each][r1] of [these cases][r2], the vulnerability is not found.\r\n> \r\n> There's a reason these exploits are usually mentioned in combination of path-setting or deep merging and that they usually involve `JSON.parse`:  The usage of `JSON.parse` allows the code to create the `__proto__` node without actually updating the prototype directly.  And then many deep-merge and path-setting functions work by mutating their input parameter with the values supplied.  In combination, that means that these tools will eventually do a deep set of `someObject .__proto__ .isAdmin`, and since a plain object supplied, `someObject .__proto__` will be `Object .prototype`, which is then mutated to include `isAdmin`.\r\n> \r\n> Ramda's design is different.  One of its guarantees is that it never mutates input data.  Ramda's equivalent of a deep set, [`assocPath`][ap], does not add properties to your object.  Instead it returns a new object, with all properties copied over from the old one and with your new property added or altered on this clone.  The various `merge` functions operate similarly.\r\n> \r\n> That means there is a wall between the data you're trying to insert and the underlying Object prototype.  It's not clear if this wall is unbreachable, but it's more difficult than in the jQuery or lodash cases, where immutability is not the default.  While avoiding such an exploit was not a reason for Ramda's immutable design, it is a good demonstration of the advantages it offers.\r\n> \r\n> So this vulnerability report was based on an invalid GitHub issue.  The Ramda team will close that issue soon.  In fact, it was only because of this report that it's been left open.\r\n> \r\n> Can the Veracode team remove this entry from its database?\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Follow-up\r\n> ---------\r\n> \r\n> The history above was a dry recital of the order of events, but it has been a very frustrating process.  Would it be possible for Veracode's [online reports][vr] to either directly include or offer a link to supporting evidence?

      "Hey @CrossEye,\r\n \r\nI work as a security analyst at BlackDuck by Synopsys. I have been made aware of this issue and have looked into the \"vulnerability\". After playing about with the fiddlejs PoC we can confirm that we too believe you are correct and this is not a security vulnerability in the ramda library and is in fact the normal behaviour of JavaScript. The PoC can be recreated using just Object.assign .  Additional Objects created do not inherit polluted properties as is the dangers of Prototype Pollution. \r\n\r\nIssues such as false positive vulnerability reports cause issues for all parties involved and especially OSS maintainers. The BlackDuck Security Advisory associated with the CVE will be updated to state that this is not a vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSince I have no control over the CVE listing, I can only update our advisory to state that this is not a security issue. By updating it hopefully it will deflect from the claims that this is a security vulnerability. \r\n\r\nHopefully Mitre will follow suit and remove the CVE as it is digested by so many security tools.\r\n\r\nTLDR: ramda is not vulnerable to Prototype Pollution as claimed in CVE-2021-42581.\r\nmapObjIndexed is copying content from __proto__ to a new object (same as assign) it is not setting global Object.prototype. \r\n \r\n Also, heres a modified jsfiddle of the \"PoC\" that shows no global prototypes are manipulated. \r\n https://jsfiddle.net/pd04r7j8/",

If you've actually read this whole thread, you will know that dealing with these issues has been enough of a headache that it's mostly chased me from doing open source for more than a year.

They may then need to check if the `nth` item in a list equals a given value. Currently, this can be achieved using `R.propEq(idx, val, list)`. However, this is less legible than `R.nthEq`. In addition, by the pure presence of `R.nth` when `R.prop` can handle indices and offsets (i.e. numbers) then `R.nthEq` should also be present.\r\n\r\nFinally, offset semantics are weirdly inconsistent in `R.propEq` when compared to `R.prop`. For example:\r\n```js\r\nconst ar = ['apple', '1A', 'math'];\r\n\r\nR.propEq(2, 'math', ar); //=> true\r\nR.propEq(-1, 'math', ar); //=> false\r\n\r\nR.prop(2, ar); //=> math\r\nR.prop(-1, ar); //=> math\r\n```\r\n",

      "Thank you for a well-written, well-reasoned PR.\r\n\r\nI absolutely think we should unify index handling in `prop` and `propEq` (and presumably also `propIs`, `propOr`, and `propSatisfies` as well.)  I honestly wish we had never supported negative indices anywhere, although I do recognize how useful they can be; they have made keeping various functions in sync a minor nightmare.  But nonetheless, we should fix those functions to match `prop`.\r\n\r\nI'm of two minds regarding adding more `nth*` functions.  \r\n\r\n`nth` was an early function in Ramda.  I'm quite sure we would not add it today, as the job is well covered by `prop`.  It seems unnecessary, and I would rather deprecate it altogether.   In the very early days, we had `map` and a separate `mapObject` because our focus on simplicity meant that one function shouldn't do two things, including accepting different types.  At some point we were convinced that Objects and Arrays shared a common abstraction of being Functors, and `map` should simply apply to all functors.  I think there is something similar here, although there's no common name for them, perhaps `Indexed` would do.  That is a real argument against `nth*` functions.\r\n\r\nBut on the other side, we have the handling of negative indices.  It makes no sense for `prop`.  In fact, we can't do this in any reasonable manner for both arrays and objects unless we type-check both the object and the key, and I'd rather not do that.  Imagine an object whose keys were positive and negative integers representing relative positions on a timeline and whose values were, say names of events related to a person's life, with year 0 being the year of birth.  Suddenly the key `-1` might reasonably mean something other than \"one element before the end\":\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst lifeline = {\r\n  '-3': 'parents met',\r\n  '-1': 'parents married',\r\n  0: 'birth',\r\n  18: 'graduated high school',\r\n  21: 'met future spouse',\r\n  22: 'graduated college',\r\n  24: 'married',\r\n  27: 'published first novel',\r\n  length: 28\r\n}\r\n\r\nprop (-1, lifeline) //=> '\"published first novel\", but expected \"parents married\"\r\n```\r\nAnd this argues for keeping `nth` and possibly expanding it.\r\n\r\nSo I am torn.  I would like to think about it and to hear arguments for and against.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, @femioladipo ?  And @ramda/core ?",

Here is [a version][rr] of the same idea, but leaving the accumulator changes to the user.

But is there a good reason to change these at all?\r\n\r\nAnother way to think about it is that these should be pretty close equivalences:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nand (x, y) //~=> x && y\r\nboth (f, g) //~=> (...args) => f (...args) && g (...args)\r\nall (fn) //~=> (xs) => xs .every (x => fn (xs))\r\nallPass ([fns]) //~=> (...args) => fns .every (f => f (...args))\r\n```\r\nThe [`&&`][la] ones, `and` and `both` act like the JS operator, and return booleans if supplied booleans but otherwise return one of their operands.\r\n\r\nThe [`every`][ev] ones, `all` and `allPass` act like the JS Array prototype function, and always return booleans.\r\n\r\nSo I think we'd need a strong argument for this.

The functions `and` and `both` have real tensions between simplicity and familiarity.  But here, thinking of this function as a variant of `Array.prototype.every`, both simplicity and familiarity suggest the current behavior.\r\n\r\nSo I'm certainly willing to entertain further discussion, but my initial impression is negative."

Given how the package is configured it might be already correctly resolved without this - when using certain tools. For example if you try to load Ramda using this URL: https://unpkg.com/ramda?module then it will redirect correctly to that internal `es/index.js`. This depends though on how exactly you plan to load the files, using what tools, intermediaries etc",

      "I'd love to see some more real-world justification of this before we proceed to consider tests.  Do you use a function like this often?  Can you show an live-ish example of the need for this function?\r\n\r\nI'm mostly bothered by the notion of uniqueness here.  What would you expect from your example, if passed these?:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[{ key: 'a', value: 1 }, { key: 'b', value: 2 }, { key: 'a', value: 42 }],\r\n[{ key: 'b', value: 3 }, { key: 'c', value: 4 }, { key: 'b', value: 101 }]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also have some concern about output order.  If we're returning an array, does the order simply match the order of the first appearance of each \"key\" in the concatenation of the two inputs?  Is that sufficient?  Or would we need to start considering left- and right-versions of this?\r\n\r\nAnd still one other question: should there be a way to *skip* output values for which there is no match?  It feels as though we might want that.  While the merge function can simply return `undefined` and a follow-up `filter(Boolean)` would cover that case, it feels dirty.  One possibility would be for that function to return an *array* of values to include in the output.  It has a slightly clumsier developer experience but offers quite a bit more flexibility.\r\n\r\nWe would also need to modify the implementation a bit, as Ramda is, at least until we get past version 1.0, expected to run on older JS engines.  It might still run on ES3 engines, and should definitely run on ES5 ones.  So we couldn't use the null operators `?.` and `??`.  But that's a fairly minor detail.",
      "One example where I needed it was something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst currentAssets = [{\r\n    otherProps: '',\r\n    hash: '1',\r\n    contractID: '1234',\r\n    createdAt: new Date()\r\n}]; // retrieved from database\r\nconst newAssets = [{\r\n    otherProps: '',\r\n    hash: '1'\r\n}]; // received from request\r\n\r\nconst assets = mergeBy(\r\n    R.prop('hash'),\r\n    (currentAsset, newAsset) => ({\r\n        ...(currentAsset ?? {}),\r\n        ...(newAsset ?? {}),\r\n        contractID: currentAsset?.contractID ?? uuid(),\r\n        active: !R.isNil(newAsset),\r\n        createdAt: newAsset ? new Date() : currentAsset.createdAt\r\n    }),\r\n    currentAssets,\r\n    newAssets\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the scenario is:\r\n- you have same assets in the database\r\n- the user is sending new assets that might create or update existing assets\r\n- the match between current and new assets is based on the `hash` key\r\n- the merged `assets` is what I'd save somewhere replacing the existing assets\r\n- when merging, I get all properties from current and new asset (the new overriding the current)\r\n- the `contractID` must either be the existing one or a new generated one\r\n- `active` is set to `true` if there is a new asset, meaning if the user didn't send any asset for that hash, the current one must be inactivated\r\n- the `createdAt` is updated if there is a new asset, if not, it remains the same",

      "@rodrigoruiz:\r\n\r\nFirst a caveat: Note that it's a big part of my role here to think not only of the requester's needs, but of anyone else's who might use a similar feature.  And of course I also have to consider the size of the library; the longer Ramda is around, the harder it becomes for new functions to make it in.  This is as it should be, but sometimes it's hard to explain why.  So I'm not trying to be argumentative.  I'm trying to come to an understanding of what you're suggesting, how it might be made useful to the widest possible audience, and whether the size of that audience -- or the difficulty of creating the function one one's own -- justifies including it inside Ramda.\r\n\r\n\r\n> One example where I needed it was something like this: [...]\r\n\r\nThank you.  That's helpful\r\n\r\n\r\n> I would not expect to receive this: [ ... ] Either way, that was not a scenario where I'd use `mergeBy`.\r\n\r\nBut remember, in a generic library like Ramda, we have to consider how users might use the tools we supply.  Ramda is pretty allergic to throwing exceptions, as they kill composability.  Taking first or last matches is certainly possible.  So is sending arrays, but then the user experience is degraded for what might be the most common case: zero or one items from the left, zero or one from the right, and always at least one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I would order them getting all keys from the left list, in the order they are generated from the items, then the same from the right list.\r\n\r\nWhile that's likely the most logical choice, the problem is that we're returning an ordered collection that has no clear intrinsic order.  When we `map` an array, for instance, the order of the result is obvious, the nth element of the output is the result of applying our transformation to the nth element of the input.  We might not keep some interesting properties of the input in the output (`map (square, [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3])` converts an ordered array into one that is not ordered) but we still understand the order.  While we can make the call for ourselves on the output order of `mergeBy`, it feels distressingly arbitrary.  Ramda still does not deal much with `Set`s, especially as it's still ES5-compatible, but would a `Set` be a more logical result, or even a `Map`, keyed off the result of your `mergeCriteria`?\r\n\r\n\r\n> There is not need for a match from the two lists, that's exactly the point.\r\n\r\nBut imagine if we include this function, other users who want to only include the result when there are matches.  While they could return `null`/`undefined`, the resulting `[undefined,  { key: 'b', leftValue: 2, rightValue: 3 }, undefined]` could be awkward and unintuitive.  It would be nice if for their case it returned just `[{ key: 'b', leftValue: 2, rightValue: 3 }]`.  I was considering ways to implement this, and one would be if the `mergeFunction` returned an *array* of results.  In your case, we would return a single-element array.  In theirs, they would return single-element arrays when there's a match and empty arrays otherwise, but we could also imagine cases where they return modified versions of *both* inputs, or return both inputs *plus* a combined one.\r\n \r\n\r\n> so if it is only in left circle I want logic A, if it is in both, logic B, and if it is only in the right circle, logic C\r\n\r\nThis makes me think of another possible implementation which might be cleaner... except that it would require six parameters.  Ramda has [only one function][ra] that takes four parameters and none that take more.  Six seems monstrous.  But I can easily see it being cleaner to separate out the logic for the three categories, and not put it into a single function:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmergeBy (\r\n  prop ('key'),\r\n  (({key, value}) => ({key, leftValue: value, rightValue: 6}),   // left only\r\n  (({key, value: leftValue}, {value: rightValue) => ({key, leftValue, rightValue}), // both left and right\r\n  (({key, value}) => ({key, leftValue: 5: value, rightValue: value}), // right only\r\n  [{ key: 'a', value: 1 }, { key: 'b', value: 2 }],\r\n  [{ key: 'b', value: 3 }, { key: 'c', value: 4 }]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne other possible extension would be to replace a unary key-generating function with a binary predicate.  Rather than creating a key that we can compare with `===`, we could require the user to specifically say when a left and a right element are identical.  This has some really nice upsides, and one major downside.  One upside is that we no longer have to generate a string or numeric value when we want to compare on three fields.  I have seen such requirements as \"If they both have the same `foo` value, the same `bar` value (irrespective of case), and their `timestamps` are within 100 ms of one another\", then they are the same.\"  A second upside is that we no longer have to treat the two sides symmetrically here.  we might write `(left, right) => left._id == right.guid`.  The downside is performance.  It would replace an algorithm that operates in `O (n + m)` time on the size of the two arrays with one that operates in `O (n * m)`.  This could be a huge issue.  But the benefits are real too.\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to consider how universal this need is and how difficult it is to write on one's own if Ramda doesn't supply it.  A function expected to be widely used is more likely to make it into the library than one that is specialized.  But one that is difficult to get correct on one's own is also more likely to make it in than one which is trivial.  I think we can see that this is non-trivial to implement, regardless of the possible variation under discussion.  But that's not enough if the audience is too small.  So do you have an argument to show that this has fairly wide application?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [ra]: https://tinyurl.com/yfbn6pko",

      "@rodrigoruiz:\r\n\r\nFirst of all:\r\n\r\n> That's the first time I try contributing to an open source project, so I don't really know the proper steps.\r\n\r\nWelcome, and you're doing great!\r\n\r\nEvery community is different.  Here, most commonly, potential new functions are first raised as an issue and then if there's interest, a pull request is made.  But probably at least a quarter of them come in directly as pull requests.  And that's fine.  The advantage of issue-first is that there's less commitment involved in writing an implementation that might not be accepted or might need to be rewritten if discussion such as ours above make changes to the API.\r\n\r\nAlso, in some places, contributions are accepted or rejected almost at once.  Here it's always a slower process.  What started as a project in self-education for the two founders has turned into a million-download-per-day behemoth.  We did not set out to maintain a popular library and are often stunned by its success.  This shows in our haphazard processes and our slow deliberations regarding changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Should I make a poll or something similar to ask more developers about this functionality?\r\n\r\nHere, I'm just going to ask @ramda/core if any of them have feedback.  But often the best way to show how useful a function might be is to cite a number of uses that you've seen or that you can easily imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n> For example, I don't understand why Ramda doesn't have the `isNotNil` function, seems common enough for it to exist.\r\nI understand your argument of \"how simple it is to implement on its own\", but I don't see how another separate function (as in a separate file on Ramda) could hurt it, so I'd add it just for the convenience.\r\n\r\nThat actually should make it in the next release.  https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/2818\r\n\r\nBut it's much easier to agree that `isNotNil` is a common need, and when it is suggested, it needs much less discussion to approve of the idea, simply because it's so obviously  useful.  That it's easy to  implement as `complement (isNil)` doesn't outweigh the obvious utility.  `mergeBy` is trickier.  But note that if we do decide that it doesn't belong in Ramda itself, it can always go in the [Cookbook][cb].  And even better, [ramda-adjunct][ra] has long served as a home for most useful well-written functions that don't quite make it into Ramda core.  @char0n is very obliging.  So if we decide it doesn't belong in Ramda itself, it could well still find a useful home.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I agree, we have many options as to how to implement `mergeBy` and I'm willing to discuss further which ones make more sense.\r\n\r\nWell good.  That's how things tend to go here.  Long discussions, sometimes involving long pauses.  But we do get somewhere eventually!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [cb]: https://github.com/ramda/rama/wiki/Cookbook\r\n  [ra]: https://github.com/char0n/ramda-adjunct\r\n\r\n",

These functions change a value of a property (or path) of an object by applying a function to it. It modifies the prop (or path) in the original array immutably (returning a shallow copy), but copies all other keys by reference. If the given property (or path) does not exist on the object, then it returns the original object.\r\n\r\nThese functions are similar to `evolve`, however this function does not validate whether the second parameter is a function, it simply fails on call. Functionally it is mostly equivalent to `over(lensProp)` or `over(lensPath)`, however based on my benchmarks (Linux, Node v15 with [benchmark.js](https://gist.github.com/daniel7grant/b5a9410d1a260f8ece3912cccb7a99ea)) it is much faster than either `evolve` and lenses, being up to two times faster for long paths.

If we decide to go this way, we can investigate further the decision about using an injectible caching strategy.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not particularly convinced that this is a good fit for Ramda.  I teeter even on `memoizeWith`.  Ramda generally avoids maintaining any internal state; memoization inherently involves state.  Granted the state is not observable, except perhaps by timing calls to the cache.  But it's still state, and that feels off to me.  If we didn't have it from our early days, we probably wouldn't add it now.  This PR adds even more state management.  That bothers me.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this is an undeniably useful function and it's non-trivial to write oneself -- two factors that help us decide whether to include something in Ramda.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear more from you, @Qquanwei about why you think this is a good idea.\r\n\r\nAnd I'd love to hear thoughts from @kudorori, @Izhaki, @meszaros-lajos-gyorgy, who participated in #2509 and of course from others interested, especially @ramda/core.

      "> Also @char0n: if this isn't something Ramda wants to take on, do you think ramda-adjunct might be interested?\r\n\r\n@CrossEye, @Qquanwei although in [ramda-adjunct](https://github.com/char0n/ramda-adjunct) we adhere to same general principles as ramda, our bar is lower and function like `memoize` would be acceptable. But it would need to be as flexible as the one provided by lodash with resolver, full cache controll and policy injection. ",
      "So I had never looked at the lodash `memoize` function.  This is the current description.  \r\n\r\n> `_.memoize(func, [resolver])`\r\n> \r\n> Creates a function that memoizes the result of `func`. If `resolver` is provided, it determines the cache key for storing the result based on the arguments provided to the memoized function. By default, the first argument provided to the memoized function is used as the map cache key. The `func` is invoked with the `this` binding of the memoized function.\r\n> \r\n> **Note**: The `cache` is exposed as the cache property on the memoized function. Its creation may be customized by replacing the `_.memoize.Cache` constructor with one whose instances implement the [Map][ma] method interface of `clear`, `delete`, `get`, `has`, and `set`.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely something in there to like.  If Ramda was to take this on, I think hanging the `cache` property off the generated function would make sense for us, and probably reusing the `Map` interface would also make sense.  (I wouldn't use a constructor but a plain function; but that's minor.)   I would keep with our explicit equivalent of `resolver`, and I would make the cache strategy a required parameter; certainly I wouldn't add the global state of `_memoize.Cache` used in lodash.  We could retain backward compatibility in `memoizeWith` as the partial application of the current strategy to a new `memoize` function.\r\n\r\nThis is still not to say that I'm sure we want to do so.\r\n\r\nBut if we do, I can see writing it this way, keeping our current `memoizeWith` for backward compatibility, but simply implementing it as `const memoizeWith = memoize(_currentNaiveCacheStrategy)`, so that now `memoizeWith.cache` has the `Map` instance interface.  (Not that `clear` or `delete` would do anything in the current strategy.)\r\n\r\nI'm still slightly queasy about the notion, though.  Perhaps it's no big deal, as it's not Ramda offering a stateful tool, only allowing users to bring their own along.  But it's still an odd direction for Ramda.\r\n\r\nI'd still really like to hear from others.  @buzzdecafe?  @Bradcomp? @davidchambers? \r\n\r\n  [ma]: http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/#sec-properties-of-the-map-prototype-object",

      "\r\nThe problem is this, when I saw this code at the time, I felt that there might be a problem with it, because it references a method of an object, but does not bind this (the most important thing is that this method uses to this). There is bound to be a bug caused by this pointing. I tried it, and sure enough, infinite recursion appeared. Take this example as an illustration `R.transduce(R.dropLastWhile(R.gt(3)), R.add,0,[1,2,3,4,5])`.\r\n\r\nFirst, when `R.transduce(...)` is executed, `R.add` is wrapped by `XWrap`.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar transduce = curryN(4, function transduce(xf, fn, acc, list) {\r\n  return _reduce(xf(typeof fn === 'function' ? _xwrap(fn) : fn)//first wrapped\r\n  , acc, list);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when `R.dropLastWhile(...)` is executed, `XWrap(R.add)` is wrapped by `XWrap` again in the `_reduce()` logic.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nXDropLastWhile.prototype.flush = function(result, input) {\r\n  result = _reduce(//Here _reduce is wrapped twice\r\n    this.xf['@@transducer/step'],\r\n    result,\r\n    this.retained\r\n  );\r\n  this.retained = [];\r\n  return this.xf['@@transducer/step'](result, input);\r\n};\r\nfunction _reduce(fn, acc, list) {\r\n  if (typeof fn === 'function') {\r\n    fn = _xwrap(fn);//where secondary wrapping happens\r\n  }\r\n  //....\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe situation can be simplified to：\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction Wrap(fn) {\r\n  this.f = fn;\r\n}\r\nWrap.prototype[\"step\"] = function (acc, val) {\r\n  return this.f(acc, val);\r\n};\r\nlet fn = new Wrap(new Wrap(R.add).step);\r\nfn.f(1, 2);\r\n```\r\nEssentially, the above code ends up forming a structure like this：\r\n```javascript\r\nthis.f = function (acc,val) {\r\n  return this.f(acc.val)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nObviously, the error mainly occurs. Two this, which should point to different objects, point to the same object, which is the cause of infinite recursion.\r\n"

      "It's interesting. I think you have a good point, and I've definitely thought about this. There's a few approaches I've looked into to match args, which all work with this implementation with small changes, but are less than ideal:\r\n1. Passing argument names as an array to the function (let's call it the angular inject-y road, which is fraught with peril when it comes to minification and feels hacky).\r\n2. Parse a function with a regex to get the params (feels un-ramda to me, though I could be wrong, and also fraught with peril).\r\n3. Divide a function into multiple phases, or have multiple functions that handle accepting of which arguments to take (which in the thread also seemed to not be the ideal option).\r\n\r\nSo I thought counting could be an interesting approach. I know it could still lead to breaking, but is it the functions responsibility with `namedCurryN` to make sure that the user provides the arguments it needs by name, or is the responsibility of the user? I would say if it was a `curry` then it maybe should, but with `curryN` it seems to be doing what it's expected to do—once you pass it 4 \"arguments\", it executes the function. If you don't pass the function the arguments it requires, then, the provided function might break and the developer should probably guard for that as there's clearly a chance that within 4 provided arguments, the required arguments for the function may not be provided. I would think that follows a similar path as this example for `curryN` in sentiment:\r\n```\r\nvar f = curryN(4, function(a, b, c, d, e, f) {\r\n    return `${JSON.stringify({a, b, c, d, e, f})} => ${(a + b * c) / d + e}`;\r\n}); \r\nconsole.log(f(12,3,6,2,4,2)) //=> 19\r\n\r\nvar g = f(12,3);\r\nconsole.log(g(6,2,4,2)) //=> 19 // good\r\n\r\nconsole.log(g(6, 2)) //=> NaN\r\n```\r\nHere, `curryN` could _know_ that the function has an arity of 6, but lets the user proceed with just 4 as it's not the responsibility of `curryN`  to know that the function will break when all args aren't provided. I know it's not 1:1 with a named `curryN` approach, but I would say that `namedCurryN` provides benefit, while a (harder to implement!) `namedCurry` would perhaps be better suited to matching?",
      "> 1. Passing argument names as an array to the function (let's call it the angular inject-y road, which is fraught with peril when it comes to minification and feels hacky).\r\n\r\nI think this would be less fraught, since we're dealing with named object properties, which presumably will not be minified, rather than parameter names, which often will.  (My code samples below choose this route, in two different ways.)\r\n\r\nI agree that your other two possibilities are non-starters.\r\n\r\n> So I thought counting could be an interesting approach. I know it could still lead to breaking, but is it the functions responsibility with `namedCurryN` to make sure that the user provides the arguments it needs by name, or is the responsibility of the user?\r\n\r\nI think there is a huge difference, though.  With Ramda's normal currying, we are depending on a cleanly-ordered set: the parameters to the base function.  With named properties, there is no useful intrinsic ordering.  And counting is really problematic for cases where a derived function wants to supply some new values as well as overrides for previously-chosen values or simple optional values.\r\n\r\nBut I think, if we're really interested in them, we can do named parameters in a not-too horrible way.  Scott Christopher mentioned one possibility in that earlier thread.  (https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/1258#issuecomment-120190987).  That only works for root-level required fields.  I have two different possibilities for deeper values.   The first one is configured with a list of required paths:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst namedCurry = (reqs, fn) =>  {\r\n  const foo = (obj) => reqs .every (\r\n    p => is (Object, path (init (p), obj)) && has (last (p), path (init (p), obj)) \r\n  ) ? fn (obj)\r\n    : (obj2) => foo (mergeDeepRight (obj, obj2))\r\n  return foo\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst f = ({foo, bar, baz: {qux: {grault, corge = 42}}}) => \r\n  [foo, bar, grault, corge]\r\n\r\nconst g = namedCurry ([\r\n  ['foo'], \r\n  ['bar'], \r\n  ['baz', 'qux', 'grault']\r\n], f)\r\n\r\ng ({foo: 1, baz: {qux: {corge: 10}}})   // returns function\r\n  ({bar: 2})                            // returns function\r\n  ({baz: {qux: {grault: 99}}})          //=> [1, 2, 99, 10]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(You can see this [in the REPL][re1].)\r\n\r\nThe second one uses a configuration object with a Symbol representing the required values:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction * getPaths(o, p = []) {\r\n  if (Object(o) !== o || Object .keys (o) .length == 0) yield p \r\n  if (Object(o) === o)\r\n    for (let k of Object .keys (o))\r\n      yield * getPaths (o[k], [...p, Number.isInteger (Number (k)) ? Number (k) : k])\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst namedCurry = Object .assign ((sample, fn) =>  {\r\n  const [reqs, bases] = partition (p => path (p, sample) == namedCurry .REQUIRED ) ([...getPaths (sample)])\r\n  const base = reduce((o, p) => assocPath(p, path(p, sample), o), {}, bases)\r\n  const foo = (obj) => reqs .every (\r\n    p => is (Object, path (init (p), obj)) && has (last (p), path (init (p), obj)) \r\n  ) ? fn (obj)\r\n    : (obj2) => foo (mergeDeepRight(mergeDeepRight(base, obj), obj2))\r\n  return foo\r\n}, {REQUIRED: Symbol ()})\r\n\r\nconst f = ({foo, bar, baz: {qux: {grault, corge = 42}}}) => \r\n  [foo, bar, grault, corge]\r\n\r\nconst REQUIRED = namedCurry.REQUIRED\r\n\r\nconst g = namedCurry ({\r\n  foo: REQUIRED, \r\n  bar: REQUIRED, \r\n  baz: {qux: {grault: REQUIRED, corge: 101}}\r\n}, f)\r\n\r\n\r\ng ({foo: 1})                          // returns function\r\n  ({bar: 2})                          // returns function\r\n  ({baz: {qux: {grault: 99}}})        //=> [1, 2, 99, 10]\r\n \r\n\r\nconst h = namedCurry ({\r\n  foo: REQUIRED, \r\n  bar: 25, \r\n  baz: {qux: {grault: REQUIRED, corge: 101}}\r\n}, f)\r\n\r\nh ({foo: 1})                          // returns function\r\n  ({baz: {qux: {grault: 99}}})        //=> [1, 25, 99, 10]\r\n \r\nh ({foo: 1})                          // returns function\r\n  ({bar: 2})                          // returns function\r\n  ({baz: {qux: {grault: 99}}})        //=> [1, 2, 99, 10]\r\n```\r\n(This is also available [in the REPL][re2].)\r\n\r\nThere might well be some cleaner way to pass around the `REQUIRED` value, as well.  I haven't really thought that through.\r\n\r\nPlease don't take either one as actual example code, only as proofs-of-concept for two different APIs.  Both would likely need some real clean-up.

      "I didn't get to spend time this week on this due to personal events, but got some time today and just updated with a new approach. There may be technical issues, so I'll fix those (and need to add some more testing scenarios for nesting), but wanted to see what you thought. I liked your suggested signature approach of a straightforward `namedCurry` with the first argument being the paths—it matches by name, and handles deep paths as well. I think this code is actually simpler to reason about than the previous as well. It also works with placeholders and will allow you to curry till all paths have been met. If you add extra params, those will be forwarded as well.",
      "Yeah, I need to add tests for this—currently the tests are copied over from `curry` and `curryN` just to quickly make sure I was covering curry base cases, but I will need to adjust them (to test paths for instance) and will remove unnecessary ones.\r\n\r\n> If we go this route, and use properties rather than full paths, how likely do you think it is that users will come back and ask for it to be applied to paths?\r\n\r\nHmm...if I understand you correctly, it should already work with paths? Right now both will work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst g = namedCurry ([\r\n  'foo', \r\n  'bar', \r\n  'baz'\r\n], f)\r\n```\r\n```\r\nconst g = namedCurry ([\r\n  ['foo'], \r\n  ['bar'], \r\n  ['baz', 'qux', 'grault']\r\n], f)\r\n```\r\nIt will continue to curry until you match all paths specified. If resolving the path returns a placeholder, it will continue to curry until you match the placeholder. That might not be the correct usage of placeholder, I can remove it. I didn't want to presume people's use cases.\r\n",
      "I adjusted the tests, removing the ones you pointed out seemed irrelevant and added a more relevant test for paths. Happy to add more if there's additional scenarios :) I also removed `curry` entirely, as I was just using it for convenience. The only public functions I'm using are `paths` and `hasPaths`, which I know is not ideal and am open to suggestion; I'm sure I could write an internal function if we'd like, I didn't feel like re-inventing the wheel and didn't see any existing internal functions I could leverage instead...perhaps there's an alternative approach to what I'm doing to check paths, but this seemed the most straightforward.\r\n\r\nThanks for the continuous feedback and helpful suggestions, by the way.",
      "> Hmm...if I understand you correctly, it should already work with paths?\r\n\r\nRight.  I did misread a bit.  However...\r\n\r\n> Right now both will work:\r\n\r\nDid you test this?  Because it shouldn't work.  I would expect this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst f = ({foo, bar, baz}) => [foo, bar, baz]\r\n\r\nconst g = namedCurry ([\r\n  'foo', \r\n  'bar', \r\n  'baz'\r\n], f)\r\n\r\ng ({foo: 'this'}) ({bar: `doesn't`}) ({baz: 'work'}) \r\n//=> function still looking for correct arguments\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst f = ({foo, bar, baz}) => [foo, bar, baz]\r\n\r\nconst g = namedCurry ([\r\n  ['foo'], \r\n  ['bar'], \r\n  ['baz']\r\n], f)\r\n\r\ng ({foo: 'but'}) ({bar: `this`}) ({baz: 'does'}) \r\n//=> [\"but\", \"this\", \"does\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's because `hasPath` is not being used properly.  It doesn't fail, just doesn't do what you'd expect when you pass it a string.  That's array-like enough that `hasPath` treats one like an array:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhasPath('foo', {foo: 1, bar: 2})            //=> false\r\nhasPath('foo', {f: {o: {o: 42}, bar: 101}}) //=> true\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf any of your tests used property names of more than one character, this would have become obvious.\r\n\r\nSo for this to work, a user would have to supply an array of arrays of Strings.  (Or Numbers or Symbols, I guess.)  That's not a wonderful API, but I can't think of anything better, except possibly the `REQUIRED` examples I gave above.",
      "> The only public functions I'm using are `paths` and `hasPaths`, which I know is not ideal and am open to suggestion\r\n\r\nIf we decide we want to do this, then we can create internal versions of each of these and make the public functions things like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default hasPath = _curry2(_hasPath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor some such.  But let's not bother with that until we make a decision about whether this function should be included in the first place, and if so, what exact API it will have.",
      "> Did you test this? Because it shouldn't work.\r\n\r\nAh yes, my response to your comment was before I pushed up the change to use `hasPath` (instead of using `path` only), so yeah it would need to be an array of array of strings. I also realize I didn't update the old tests to reflect that (though the new one added is written correctly). I personally think an array of arrays of strings as paths is intuitive but open to opinions.\r\n\r\nI'll fix the tests and push it up.",
      "Everything is pushed up, if you noticed anything else",
      "> So the question -- and I want to address this to all of @ramda/core and others who are interested -- is whether this API feels like a good match for Ramda. It clearly has its utility, and it's clearly something that is complex enough to make a library implementation useful. But does it match Ramda.\r\n\r\nI have some comments I want to make on the PR itself, but I wanted to first answer this question. \r\n\r\nTLDR: I don't see any issue with adding this - it's close enough to our philosophy, but would really only be helpful for codebases that like currying to be able to interface with libraries of differing philosophies.\r\n\r\nI probably won't use this function. I can see its usefulness though. I typically think Ramda style currying (and thus the code I write when using Ramda) works best when functions have a static arity with well ordered parameters. This guides a lot of the work I do when I am designing function APIs - what order makes sense for the parameters? What parameters do I actually need? How is this going to be called? Etc.\r\n\r\nUsing Objects to simulate named parameters is a good idea, but I typically don't use them that way. When I have Objects that represent more than a single parameter  (as opposed to passing in a record or a map) it is generally because either the data comes to me that way or it's an optional config variable where none of the properties are required (if they are required I will put them in a positional parameter).\r\n\r\nThere are functions in the world and in other libraries that use named parameters. In those cases I think this would be useful to convert those into something that would be more in line with how the rest of a codebase does things. Even then, would it be useful to do it this way, or to take a function with named parameters and convert it into a curried one that takes positional parameters?\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I can see how this could work and how it could be used to make people's lives easier, and I don't think it really goes against anything in our philosophy so I think it's good. \r\n\r\nI have no insight on a name, but I will let it kick around in my head for a bit.",
      "Alright, I _think_ I got everything mentioned above fixed in the latest push—thanks for feedback. I also added two property tests, similar to the curry examples, that test argument order irrelevance and multiple values (though perhaps the one for multiple values is redundant as it's very similar to the order test).\r\n\r\nI can see the points around how this could use a different name, so open to suggestions. And if you spot anything else, just let me know.",
      "I'm still stuck for a good name.  While not absolutely opposed to using \"curry\" in the name, my preference, as discussed above, would be to do something different.",
      "I created [a Stack Overflow question][so] regarding the function name.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [so]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/62882449",
      "One alternative brought up on StackOverflow is not to treat this like `curry`, but more like `partial`, something akin to\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst partialObject = (fn, obj) => (o) =>\r\n  fn ({...obj, ...o}) // really a deep merge, but this should explain the idea.\r\n\r\nconst f = ({a, b, c, d}) => (a + b * c) / d\r\n\r\npartialObject \r\n  (f, {a: 12, b: 3}) //=> new function\r\n  ({c: 6, d: 2})     //=> 15\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis of course doesn't let us specify the required structure of the output object, which seemed one of the main reasons for this PR.  But that is also its problem.  Having a function that is curried generally makes it clear what the signatures of the subsequent partially applied functions are.  Here it seems quite fuzzy.  But with partial application, the library is no longer trying to pretend to offer you that, only to make it easier to create a version of the function which bakes in an incomplete object so you no longer have to specify those properties..",
      "Yeah, you know what, that makes a lot of sense to me–I'll give it a tinker tonight, it's a solid suggestion.",
      "This is interesting. Do you think it would be worthwhile to provide an optional merge function as a third argument for added control with a default of `mergeDeepRight`? Or does that feel outside the scope of the function?\r\n\r\nSomething like `(f, o, mergeFn) => (props) => f.call(this, (mergeFn && mergeFn(o, props) || mergeDeepRight(o, props)))`? I think it could be an interesting way to provide extra control over data structures and transformations without having to provide paths...",
      "> Do you think it would be worthwhile to provide an optional merge function as a third argument for added control with a default of `mergeDeepRight`? \r\n\r\nWell, even if Ramda didn't have a hard stance against optional arguments, this would not feel right to me.  It loses too much of its simplicity.  If there is a strong argument for this, we could consider offering multiple functions, one that accepts such an initial merge argument, one that curries in `mergeDeepRight` for that and possibly one that curries in `mergeDeepLeft`.\r\n\r\nBut I wouldn't do that yet; we can always refactor to that.  I don't see much call for `mergeDeepLeft` or other merge capabilities.  Yes, it would offer an API that lets you progressively fix parameters that can no longer be overridden.  But since the initial function is still presumably available, that control seems superfluous, simply an unnecessary complication.",
      "I see—makes sense. I just pushed up a `partialObject` implementation, curious about what you all think of it. It does seem a lot cleaner than specifying a path, and (at least for the use cases I have in mind) it would be very useful.\r\n\r\nI carried over a test from the `partial` function, and created two more (one to test order, one to test deep merge). Finally, I know it's probably not great, but I imported the public `mergeDeepRight` as I didn't see an internal implementation.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know it's called `partialObject` now, but do we think it should be `partialObjectDeep`? I wonder if there would be a use case for `partialObject` on its own where it doesn't merge deep.",
      "Sounds great! Yes I agree, the simplicity of it ended up being quite nice I think :) I cleaned up and labelled the test better, so hopefully it's in a good spot.\r\n\r\nI also realized in my PR that there were a bunch of changes to the package-lock which was odd...so those are gone from the PR now too.",

      "Sure, that seems reasonable. I'll need a little guidance, though: how am I to handle the transducer case? The docs do not suggest to me that `traverse` can be used as a transducer, so what should it do in that case?",
      "@Bradcomp, I've given your suggestion a go, and with some thought, I think I've changed my mind about using `_dispatch` here. I would argue that using `_dispatch` is, at best, out of the scope of this particular PR.\r\n\r\nThere aren't any instances I could find of [`_dispatchable` being used](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/search?p=3&q=_dispatchable&unscoped_q=_dispatchable) to implement functions that cannot be used as transducers. So no established convention exists that I can follow. In fact, to use `_dispatchable` for a function that has no documented use as a transducer is contrary to the existing conventions of this library.\r\n\r\nGiven this, if I were to refactor to using `_dispatchable`, I would have to figure out what the \"right\" value to use for the transducer argument of `_dispatchable` is. Should it be a function? Or `undefined`? Or `null`? Or something else? If it should be a function, what should the function do? Should it be a runtime error? If so, should the error be thrown, or should it be returned? What should the error message be? If it should not be an explicit error, should it return `undefined`? Or `null`? Or the passed in transformer, unaltered? Something else?\r\n\r\nThis PR was opened because there was a missing dispatch case in `traverse`. Not because `traverse` needed a refactor. Perhaps it does need a refactor. But this is supposed to be a bug fix, not a refactor, is it not? I'm not trying to be snarky, I mean this sincerely, and I apologize if I'm coming across that way.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I'm not convinced there is a substantive advantage to using `_dispatchable`, anyway. It is added complexity: now a potential contributor has to figure out what the function does, and they have to be careful about the transducer argument even though `traverse` isn't one. Which seems like a potential footgun `_dispatchable` also seems to add to the call stack at runtime, since it [appears to not get optimized away in the build](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/blob/v0.27.0/dist/ramda.js)? The benefit seems to be that it unifies the codebase toward one cleaner, more consistent style, but given there are more functions that *don't* use `_dispatchable` than do, I'm not sure if this PR really achieves that.\r\n\r\nIt's been a month since this PR was passing all checks, including test cases I provided that addressed the missing functionality that prompted me to open this issue and #3026. As far as I know, @Bradcomp, your suggestion does not change the functionality, isn't that correct? It proposes a refactor, which, on its face, seems perfectly reasonable. But once you dig a little deeper, it turns out to be a meaningfully more involved undertaking. No precedent exists for what you are describing, so a new convention has to be established, albeit a small one.\r\n\r\nAs such, in my opinion, I think it would be more appropriate for this PR to comply with the existing convention of only using `_dispatchable` with transducers. If the maintainers decide it would be better to do an overhaul and use `_dispatchable` for everything, transducer or not, that's fine. But that's out of scope here. I just wanted to fix a small, niggling issue that was bothering me and maybe others, and has not yet been fixed for reasons unrelated to the extensional functionality of the proposed fix.\r\n\r\nSo with due respect to @Bradcomp who suggested it, and @CrossEye who :+1: it, I do not think it makes sense to refactor `traverse` to use `_dispatchable` in this PR. I appreciate the suggestion, and would happily comply if it made sense in the context of the existing conventions of the codebase. However, I have not seen evidence to support that. You are welcome to convince me otherwise. But until such time as you have done so, I respectfully decline, and request that this PR be merged in its current form, if there are no other concerns to address.",

My concern is less of a hands holding one and more of an 'avoid magic' one. \r\n\r\nAny time we make an assumption about what our user means based on what they don't tell us, we are hiding a potential error that could result in a bug. \r\n\r\nIn most cases, if `reduce` is called with `undefined` as the foldable, it means the developer has made a mistake.

      "@Bradcomp The question of how Ramda is used. For frontend/mobile this library is practical because some functions are null safety.\r\nIn addition (as @CrossEye mentioned), `reduce` differs from `map`/`filter` in that it has the initial state (accumulator) given.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can take the second approach, in which Ramda is the equivalent of the Haskell lens.\r\nBut in this case, why the types are checked anywhere? Why `prop(null, {})` doesn't return an error?\r\nIn this approach, we should also not show \"fantasy ground issue\" errors (this is very magical error for some developers), but something more usefull, e.g \"list is null\" ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "@Bradcomp:\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that we generally keep the Garbage In - Garbage Out mantra.  If you supply types of data not supported by Ramda's contracts, then you should not count on the behavior whatsoever.  But as developers and users of the library, we should also want to prevent unexpected exceptions as best we can.  When we can't, I feel fine letting it fail in whatever way it happens to fail -- throwing an exception, launching the missiles, insulting your children.  But when we can, I think it's best that we do. \r\n\r\nI edited my previous comment, because I mentioned `defaultTo`, when I should have been speaking of `propOr`.  In `propOr` we know exactly what result the user wants if the property is nil.  We could throw an exception in the case the object is nil, and that would certainly fit best with our let-it-fail philosophy.  But that seems to ignore what the user told us: that if the property isn't there, we should return the default.  It seems to cause almost no harm to return the default.  It will serve as a failsafe for those who want it.  And for those who don't, we already supply no guarantees of behavior when they supply bad data; so we haven't hurt them.  If they wanted a specific error in this case, then they would need to generate it on their own.\r\n\r\nAnd that's how I feel about this one too.  By supplying the initial accumulator, the user has already told us what to return if there's no data.  We hurt no one and help some by returning this on a nil `list`.\r\n\r\nI guess I don't think of it as magic so much as giving the best answer we can to the question asked.  The data is simply not bad enough that we have to throw our hands up.\r\n\r\n@ku8ar, @davidchambers:\r\n\r\nWhile I would certainly not object to having better error messages, I'm quite loathe to spend the effort on the code required to implement them or to take the performance hit of all the checks necessary to report them.

We are removing a helpful error on a function with a clear signature and long history. I think depending on one's view of safety this definitely makes `reduce`, which is super widely used and understood, more dangerous.\r\n\r\nThis isn't GIGO. GIGO is to let it fail. This is to prevent it from failing in the case that it should.\r\n\r\nThe principal we want to look at here is probably this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle\r\n\r\nI think there could be an argument made either way here. I think that having predictable functions that do what you expect is a benefit, at least in how I tend to write code. \r\n\r\n```\r\nconst getRating = pipe(\r\n defaultTo([]),\r\n reduce(add, 0)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n \r\nPersonally, for me, this code is way clearer than `reduce(add, 0)` for the given use case because it breaks up the piece that handles invalid input from the piece that actually performs the calculation.",

But currently Ramda is used in projects that are created quickly, by a business that expects results as soon as possible.\r\nErrors in such projects will happen often.\r\nAnd now we have a choice:\r\n- return \"null\" for incorrect data\r\n- call exception in runtime\r\n\r\nFor frontend/mobile, the \"garbage in - garbage out\" approach is a much better option. We do not harm. And developers have another reason to use `R.map` instead of `Array.map`.\r\n\r\nAnd in my personal opinion, every exception is a violation of the principle of functional programming. \"throw\" is like a linear jump. The functional code should handle garbage as follow: \"you gave me a null to which there is no logical answer, so please, here is your null\""

Typically with `arguments` we are just passing them along to another function using apply or call. That happens in a really large number of our functions, and how we do that should definitely be consistent.

And I understand where y'all are at w/r/t let-it-fail, but this isn't very usable as is -- it's not type-checking in my mind so much as the basic requirements for composition: the composition of a function and a non-function is unresolvable garbage.\r\n\r\nIf you're not into this PR, I'm happy to publish it as a standalone library, but at that point I'll just fork all of `ramda` rather than use two different libraries for the same purpose (which I am loathe to do, as `ramda` solves nearly all problems out of the box).",

But currently most of JS code is executed on smartphones.\r\n\r\nSuppose we have such React component:\r\n```\r\nconst fields = ['name', 'surname', 'nickname', 'age', 'status', 'active']\r\nconst Item = ({item}) => (\r\n<View>{map(field =>  <Text>{prop(field, item)}</Text>, fields)}</View>\r\n)\r\n```\r\nOf course, this code is maximally simplified. Usually Ramda is directly in selectors.\r\nAnd we display this component 50 times (item list).\r\n\r\nFinally, 300 calls come out for each single application rendering.\r\n\r\nAnd now please look how efficient the prop() function is on Android:\r\n![83171325_853379038455037_7202341597667655680_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16975059/73125031-98db9280-3fa2-11ea-8b1f-7decd1538239.png)\r\n\r\nIt gives us: (1 / 282169) * (6 * 50) * 1000 = 1 ms\r\nAnd with optimization it gives us: (1 / 19790334) * (6 * 50) * 1000 = 0,01 ms\r\n\r\nFinally, we waste 1ms on simply retrieving value from object, which could be done using: `field && field.value`\r\n\r\nHow many such rerenders will the app have? Will there be only one list called at time? Is it worth adding this code to save 1ms? I do not know.\r\n\r\nThinking about such micro-optimization begins to be difficult when we understand that in addition to displaying, such a list of items could also be used for something else. E.g. a hook that does something:\r\n```\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  track('active items showed', pipe(filter(prop('active'), map(prop('id'))))(items))\r\n}, [])\r\n```\r\nOr when it turns out that there are 1000 elements in store, and we only have to show 50:\r\n```\r\n<Items items={filter(prop('isBelongToMe'), allItems)} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly it turns out that it only took 15 ms to get properties from objects during first rendering. And that's 1 FPS lost...\r\n\r\nOf course, someone can say in a moment: why don't you optimize this app? Or why keep up 1000 items in a redux store?\r\nBut that is not the point. The prop() function is the base. This function is used to create another functions, so it's performance overhead should be minimal...",

Do you have any thoughts on how to write some regression tests to ensure that the API keeps in sync with `path`?\r\n\r\nAlso, we could probably optimize `path` quite a bit by not depending on (in my impression the rarely used) `paths`.  We could easily write the dependency the other way by mapping.  I wonder how much of the lost performance we would gain by doing so.\r\n\r\nI rarely use `prop` or `path` unless the code-base is already heavily using Ramda; they are so easy to write as custom functions.  But we do want both to make them efficient and to make them work the same as much as feasible.  It would be great to be able to do the latter automatically, but it's probably not worth it with this much performance degradation on the line.",

E.g. I use more often the flipped version of `contains` to determine that a value is contained in a known set (enumeration). In that case the enumeration is clearly the least-changing argument and should come first. However, it would be perhaps unpractical for Ramda to introduce it's functions in all permutations. For that there is `flip` and `__`.\r\n \r\nIf this change comes through, we may eliminate the inconsistency with `propSatisfies`, but how many other will be introduced?\r\nE.g. `assoc`, `adjust` and `update` are authored in the way that least-changing is *where* the value is.",

So in my view the parameters order should be consistent.\r\n\r\nYou make reasonable observations (as always) but we don't need to put everything into the same bag either. I don't see `propEq` and the like as related to functions such as `assoc` (just my opinion here).\r\n\r\nThis PR has been opened for more than two years now so we ought to make a decision at some point.

Here's where I really miss Haskell's left- and right-sections.",
      "Hi, this is a change in the API of a popular function in Ramda, shouldn't it call for an update to the major version?",
      "I think this change was a huge misstake and a horrible breaking change.\r\n\r\n**But the misstake was made long ago!**\r\n\r\nTo explain, I'm thinking of the process of adding functions to an API.\r\n_After a function need (\"step 0\") is identified_:\r\n\r\n**Step 1. Signature**\r\nHere, the often repeated \"put the least changing / most general arguments first\", also called the \"data-last principle\", is to be used. Worth noting is that a function would never be considered \"data\".\r\n\r\n**Step 2. Naming**\r\nHere comes the hard part.\r\n- If the function is a general & commonly understood concept, like \"map\", \"filter\", \"reduce\", use that name. Or perhaps another general and \"fluffy\" word would fit (ex: \"converge\", \"scan\"), great -- one should rely on the documentation.\r\n- If the name is to be invented and **will somehow include or reference any of the arguments, the references must come in the opposite order as the signature**. This is because of currying and readability (and consistency with the absolute majority of the ramda library). (Ex: `R.minBy(square)`, `R.mergeWith(R.concat)`, `R.has(\"name\")`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Example 1: A function that checks a predicate for an object prop**\r\nStep 1: \r\n(a → Boolean) → String → {String: a} → Boolean\r\nNote, as mentioned above, a function is to be considered highly general and \"far away\" from being \"data\". Therefor the predicate is best put first.\r\n\r\nStep 2:\r\nThere is no commonly known concept to apply here as a name, but `propSatisfies` would be great because the last word references the first argument, and the first word references the second! **So the meaning of the \"sentence\" _points_ to the beginning of the argument list.**\r\n\r\n**Example 2: A function that checks an object prop aganst a value**\r\nStep 1: \r\nString → a → Object → Boolean\r\n`a` is a value closer to being \"data\" than the name of the prop, therefor it should come later in the argument list.\r\n\r\nStep 2:\r\nThis is an equality check, and it references a prop in an object. But if our name is to include argument references, the order is important. `valueAtProp` has the right order of arg references so it's a great candidate (but perhaps is missing the word \"equals\"/\"eq\")? `eqAtProp` or even `eqProp` then? `propEq` is **not** a good candidate however, because it implies that the first argument should be the equality check somehow. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf the current `propEq` should have been named correctly, there would be no inconsistency with `propSatisfies`. The signature being the most logical and user friendly should come before the naming. The issue here was therefor the name and not the (great) signature of `propEq`. **The question is: What is a good name for the needed signature?**\r\n\r\nThis has been pointed out before, mainly by \"TheLudd\", \"helios1138\" and \"Bradcomp\" [here](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/2428), and I also read there that (2018) **\"The order of propEq was actually changed in one release and then changed back because of many complaints.\"**. Perhaps a repeat on that one ;P.\r\n\r\nIs it time to correct this the right way, for version 1.0? :)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Well, so I should clarify that the change was maybe actually good, but then we need a better function with a great signature (and a fitting name).\r\n",

This is actually the larger issue. To use `=0.28.0` and `>=0.29.0` across shared code, I suggest creating your own `propEq` locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript \r\n// propEq.js, kept in local utils\r\nimport { curry, equals, prop } from 'ramda'\r\n\r\nexport const propEq = curry((name, val, obj) => \r\n  equals(val, prop(name, obj)))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript \r\n// app.js\r\nimport { filter } from 'ramda'\r\nimport { propEq } from './utils'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have my own everyday ramda [utils](https://github.com/crshmk/utils) I've built over the years, so I just [added](https://github.com/crshmk/utils/commit/7a9aca0e7e1b9c8f5db0cf487afc7cc08163acba) it to those. In this way, all my apps can use version `0.28` or `0.29` of ramda as long as they grab the current version of my utils and import `propEq` from there (as above). \r\n\r\nFinally, respectfully, the best solution would be to admit that we already [litigated](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/1286) this and to revert, preferably quickly.

I wish this project to immediately release 1.0 and follow strict semver. Breaking changes are fine. Just make a new major release. That is what that is for!\r\n\r\nI agree. Every lib should actually always start with v1.0.0, from the very beginning, for the npm semver system to work well. I recommend to read e.g. this article on this subject: https://medium.com/javascript-scene/software-versions-are-broken-3d2dc0da0783\r\n",
      "First, as a reminder for everyone, per the rules of semver, for **major version zero**, minor bumps should be considered breaking. Ref: https://semver.org/#spec-item-4\r\n\r\nThat being said, IMHO `ramda` should have reached `1.0.0` long ago. Regardless of function names and signatures, what `ramda` offers as an API and how each function works are very stable. I personally don't see a reason to keep it as `0.x`. That would have alleviated the main issue of the \"breaking\" expectation\r\n\r\nTo address the argument order of `propEq`, I agree with the signature change made in this MR. With that change, the following functions all share the same argument order:\r\n* pathEq\r\n* pathOr\r\n* pathSatisfies\r\n* propEq\r\n* propIs\r\n* propOr\r\n* propSatisfies\r\n\r\nI'm going to argue that this consistency is the most important part here. What the argument order _should_ be is completely subjective.\r\n\r\nAs for function naming, we have a pretty decent convention going already, for the aforementioned functions, the convention is `subject -> prop/path -> object -> boolean`. In contrast, we have these functions\r\n* assoc\r\n* assocPath\r\n* dissoc\r\n* dissocPath\r\n* adjust\r\n* update\r\n\r\nIf we fully qualify the names, we get this:\r\n* assocProp\r\n* assocPath\r\n* dissocProp\r\n* dissocPath\r\n* adjustIndex\r\n* updateIndex\r\n\r\nAnd the convention for these are `prop/path -> subject -> object -> object`.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, when prop/path comes first in the function name, prop/path is the second argument, and when prop/path comes second in the function name, prop/path is the first argument\r\n\r\nNow, that convention could also apply to the fact that prop/path second is \"mutate\" and prop/path first is \"evaluate against\". We could keep that naming convention for that purpose and have them all share the same general signature of `prop/path -> subject -> object -> result` (this is what I meant about the argument order being subjective).\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think consistency is the most important part here. Therefore I vote _not_ to revert this MR.\r\n\r\nIf it is decided that the argument order should be changed, then I would propose that, as part of a long overdue `1.0.0` release, change **ALL** of their signatures to be `prop/Path -> subject -> object -> boolean` **TOGETHER** as part of a single release.",
      "Every function should stand on its own and not be dependent on or ruled by other functions and their most logical & convenient names and signatures (arg order). I don't think that arg order is always subjective, but the name should reflect the order, that is most important.\r\nYou could probably find many different groupings among all ramda functions, but if a grouping is based on names, and we adjust signatures based on the group of names, then we are working backwards! Signature comes first, then a name that correctly reflects what the function does AND (almost more importantly) the argument order -- regardless of other functions in the library.\r\n(See my previous post)",
      "> regardless of other functions in the library.\r\n\r\nGood APIs have consistent and predictable behavior. And that includes function signatures and argument order. My point is that they should be consistent. I'm not particular about which of the 2 orders here is correct, `subject -> prop/path -> object -> boolean` or `prop/Path -> subject -> object -> boolean`.\r\n\r\n>  I don't think that arg order is always subjective\r\n\r\nWhat I mean to say is the reasoning behind why the arguments should be in the order they are is subjective.

I could argue that the `Key` is closer to the `Object` in both cases.\r\n\r\nBesides, `propEq = (value, key, obj) => propSatisfies(x => x === value, key, obj)`\r\n\r\nWhatever the order is, just have it be consistent. `propEq` was inconsistent before, and now it is.\r\n\r\nI don't disagree with you that `propEq` should be `String -> a -> Object -> Boolean`, all I'm saying is that if we choose to do that, we should for `propSatisfies`, `propIs`, etc, as well.",

My arguments for why `propEq` should have been changed as described in this MR from the start is solely for that and that alone. That does not mean that I disagree with you on the fact that the names _should_ be different to better represent their signatures, or that the signatures _should_ be different to better match the current names.\r\n\r\nMy goal is for consistency in behavior and expectation in the API.\r\n\r\n> If the rules that I wrote in my first long post are followed, then the API would be entirely consistent.\r\n\r\nAlso agree, as it aligns with my stated goal",
      "So, the solution could be simple. \r\n\r\n**`propEq` is not really a useful function**, as @crshmk has pointed out multiple times above. It could stay in the library, with arg order changed as by this MR, but the library should have the **more useful** function `valAtProp` (or whatever would be the best name). Also change the other inconsistent functions (their names!) according to @semmel.\r\n\r\nRelease 1.0.0.\r\n\r\nAgain, the order of designing any API function should be: \r\n\r\n**Need -> Signature -> Name**\r\n\r\nNever change the signature of a function to match the faulty name it unfortunately got. The signature was designed out of **greatest utility**. The name should change if it got a bad one. Changing the name is not initially a breaking change, it could start with a minor release of **adding** the new name to the API and flagging the old as \"will be removed in the next major\". Ramda could have this as part of its _change strategy_.",
      "100% agree with @whitelizard\r\nAnd I would add that I think it's preferable to consider the users of the library and their (often large) code base when planning such a huge change. By this I mean the difficulty of the migration needed when inverting the parameters order of a curried function, which could be used in several ways, compared to the simplicity of the migration if we just changed its name.\r\n\r\nI also agree with having consistent functions in a library is a good thing, but maybe it would be a good thing also to add another function (temporary or not) to replace with when migrating.",

Having both varieties of all these functions would help a lot in that regard.\r\n\r\nYes, and I would extend that to a few *binary* functions too. They have crept up in [Ramda-adjunct](https://char0n.github.io/ramda-adjunct/4.0.0/index.html) eg. `R.includes ≡ flip(RA.included)`, `R.append ≡ flip(RA.appendFlipped)`, but in Ramda too e.g. `R.difference ≅ flip(R.without)`. \r\n\r\nThis is always when *\"…the reasoning behind why the arguments should be in the order they are is subjective\"*.\r\n\r\nAnother example which comes to my mind is `concat`.

That reasoning is ok. Is is not too hard to figure out and consistent in Ramda (`difference`, `subtract`).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while you @Harris-Miller mention it, `flip` for functions of arity 3+ gives my headaches — and not because of TypeScript.

      "I know this has been beat to death, but I'd just like to add my two cents. I really hate this change. I just propEq and pathEq way more than propSatisfies. Plus, the naming, as other has suggested, practically tells you how to use it: prop, then equals. I've always had to look up the docs when needing propSatisfies simply because of the naming inconsistency. But even still, I think it would have made more sense to change propSatisfies to match the other two. /shrug",
      "would it be possible to mention this change in the `propEq` documentation at least?  it's extremely confusing for anyone using 0.28.0 that hasn't read this thread.  i just wasted several hours trying to figure out why my code was working in the doc page but not in my code.\r\n\r\nthanks.",

      "I'm a newbie to functional programming and recently I notice something weird to me when looking into Ramda source code. Some methods of Ramda seem not favour pointfree style, like gt, substract and concat. The argument order of concat I expected is concat(what, data), but Ramda's implementation is more likely to be translated as \"a concat b\". When using Ramda's concat in partially application or function pipeline, we write code like:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst concatRamda = flip(concat('ramda'))\r\ncompose(toUpperCase, concatRamda)('enter ') //=> 'ENTER RAMDA'\r\n```\r\nIn my opinion concat(what, data) is more nature and intutive. We does not need to introduce extra flip and it's more consistent with the remaining codebase. Does Ramda design these methods for a reason? \r\n",

If the latter, what do you see duplicated?\r\n\r\nAs to this:\r\n\r\n> Does Ramda design these methods for a reason?\r\n\r\nI'm just going to repost part of my answer from https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/2895#issuecomment-536237789:\r\n\r\n>> BTW it's strange to see that R.gt and R.lt using first argument as value.\r\n\r\n> You're asking about things that have a long history of controversy in Ramda.

If this does turn out to be an issue though, I can remove it from that PR.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% happy with the descriptions/tests - the descriptions could probably do with being a bit clearer and I thought it was worth checking the arity/ability to curry is preserved. Would appreciate some comments on this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR naturally raises the question of mapping over Promises or Generators directly?\r\nWe already have `andThen` for map/flatMapping over Promises, so you can get away with just doing:\r\n`map(andThen(x => x + 1), async x => x * 2)(42) // Promise(85)`\r\n\r\nA Generator (object) can only be iterated over once:\r\n```\r\nconst foo = function*(){ yield 1; yield 2; yield 3 }\r\nconst generatorFoo = foo()\r\ngeneratorFoo.next()\r\n// {value: 1, done: false}\r\nfor (val of generatorFoo){ console.log(val) }\r\n// 2\r\n// 3\r\nfor (val of generatorFoo){ console.log(val) }\r\n// (nothing logged!)\r\ngeneratorFoo.next()\r\n{value: undefined, done: true}\r\n```\r\nGenerator objects are naturally stateful so to my knowledge they can't be copied, so presumably a `R.map` that works with Generator objects (as opposed to Generator Functions) should create a new generator that internally invokes the original (potentially already used) generator.\r\n(this is admittedly possible to do yourself with `mapGenerator` manually e.g. `mapGenerator(x => x + 1, function*() { yield* someOtherGeneratorObject })` and it carries all the same ambiguities of a side effect)\r\n\r\nUnlike `mapAsync`, which at least implies some relationship to AsyncFunctions, not Promises, Generators are their own object that GeneratorFunctions create. \r\nIf this ability to map over Generator objects was added to `map`, I wonder if `mapGenerator` would be a misleading name for anyone unaware of the dichotomy. On the other hand, `mapGeneratorFunctionAsGeneratorFunctor` is not very good either.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI experimented with having `mapAsync` return an async function, and `mapGenerator` return a generator function, but aside from being difficult to get right and likely complicating the currying/arity-related internal functions, it also is inconsistent with the way Ramda handles (auto)currying.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\nconst foo = mapAsync(x => x + 1, (a, b, c) => a + b + c)(10) // AsyncFunction\r\nconst bar = foo(20) // Promise of an AsyncFunction?\r\n```\r\nIf `foo` is now an AsyncFunction, then we can't continue to invoke it with\r\nthe extra arguments like (20, 30) as we'll get a Promise of a (Async)Function, not a Function.\r\n```\r\nconst foo = mapAsync(x => x + 1, (a, b, c) => a + b + c)(10) // Function\r\nconst bar = foo(20) // AsyncFunction\r\nconst baz = bar() // Promise of an AsyncFunction?\r\n```\r\nIf `foo` is now a Function, we CAN continue to apply it into `bar`, which is now an AsyncFunction, then this breaks in the same way as the previous example - `bar` should always return a Promise, but if we apply it with no arguments (or with `(_)`), then Ramda's autocurrying rules require it to return the same function as before, but AsyncFunctions always return Promises.\r\n\r\nSo as far as I can see it doesn't really work to mapAsync/Generator async/generator functions into other async/generator functions, because Ramda's rules require autocurried functions to be able to always return a value or the function again.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to not use any autocurrying at all, but that would mean `mapAsync` and `mapGenerator` would now have different behaviour to `map` in the kind of function they return. Maybe this is desirable, I'm not sure. It would look something like this:\r\n```\r\nvar mapAsync = _curry2(function mapAsync(fn, asyncFunction) {\r\n  return async function() {\r\n    return fn.call(this, await asyncFunction.apply(this, arguments));\r\n  };\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/2675#discussion_r249797293\r\n> probably only for v1.0+\r\n\r\nI don't expect this PR to be merged in the short term as it would mean requiring runtime support for AsyncFunctions and GeneratorFunctions- this PR is hopefully a way to unblock/provide clarity for https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/2675 !\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

House style uses `while` loops, not `for` loops.  One of the founders of Ramda has made it a personal goal to never write another explicit `for` loop, and it has made it into our codebase.  It would better to keep this consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [li]: https://travis-ci.org/ramda/ramda/jobs/552330172",

      "@Bradcomp: I agree with @buzzdecafe about it too, although I'm perhaps less adamant about it.  I think I was the one who wrote the original pass where we used `while` loops, but that had to do as much with ancient lore about the relative performance of `while` and `for` as with this distaste for `for`.  But I like not seeing any ugly C-style `for` loops in our code-base.\r\n\r\nThat's a more minor objection, but it's real.  The syntax of the `for(init; test; step) {body}` is pretty horrible.  Just watching the order control flow moves between `init`, `test`, `step`, and `body` helps explain why many find computer programming arcane.  Even using the same semicolon used otherwise as a statement terminator as an internal separator is odd.  I have much less problem with `for-of` statements.\r\n\r\nBut of course the main objection is that unless it's for side effects, pretty well every `for` loop I see can be more clearly and explicitly expressed as a `filter`, `find`, `map`, `some`, `every`, or `reduce`.   The objection is simply one of code clarity.  And if it's for side-effects, `forEach` has cleaner syntax.",

I also, added an option that detects if there is a placeholder to handle, or if you can just concatenate the arguments.

      "@Bradcomp Hi 👋. Thanks for replying. I understand the general point you're raising, but I'm not sure I fall on the same side.\r\n\r\n> One of the important tenets of functional programming is that functions are first class - you can treat them the same way you treat every other value.\r\n\r\nI see where you're coming from, but how would this PR change the fact that functions are treated as first class citizens in `ramda`, exactly? I sense only a superfluos connection here.\r\n\r\n> I worry about any change that would treat a special type of data differently 'under the hood'. \r\n\r\nUnderstandable. But `applySpec` [already does that](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/blob/03817fe578048652b9532ae71fd1f1705da4de60/source/applySpec.js#L50) by explicitly checking the `typeof` of its input - so, in this case, the counter argument feel stronger to me.\r\n\r\n> What if a user wants to add a method to an object using applySpec?\r\n\r\nThis is a valid objection. It honestly didn't occur to me and have never felt the need to do that - but I do see the discrepancy in the API. The only reply I can think of is that, even with the current approach, adding a function to an object doesn't necessarily require using `always`. This PR adds support for \"literal\" values. Since the API for `applySpec` applies _functions_, the only way to set a function as a spec is to have a function returning function: `() => () => ...` (a.k.a.: `always(() => ...)` - which is the exact same thing you would do if this PR gets merged. Nothing would change.\r\n",
      "> I see where you're coming from, but how would this PR change the fact that functions are treated as first class citizens in ramda, exactly? I sense only a superfluos connection here.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `applySpec` has a type signature that restricts the leaves of the spec to be functions. After this change, the leaves could be anything. Once that happens, we will be special casing the leaves that are functions and not treating them the same as the other value leaves.\r\n\r\n> But applySpec already does that by explicitly checking the typeof of its input - so, in this case, the counter argument feel stronger to me.\r\n\r\nSee above. The input is a tree. it has branches and leaves that are treated differently. This is a separate concern from treating the values of leaves differently based on their type. \r\n\r\nThe code assumes that there will only be functions as leaves, which is what leads to the odd behavior of your original example. While it might be better to throw if it gets something that's a leaf but not a function, I think GIGO is a reasonable alternative.\r\n\r\n> Nothing would change.\r\n\r\nA change in the type signature requires rethinking what the reasonable behavior is. Currently (and this would need to be changed too), the first line of the description is this:\r\n\r\n> Given a spec object recursively mapping properties to functions\r\n\r\nThis is no longer true, as we are now accepting a spec recursively mapping properties to anything. but then we aren't treating that anything consistently, instead giving it a special meaning depending on what it is.\r\n\r\nThe question in modifying the behavior of a function (as opposed to fixing a bug) shouldn't be what changes there are from previous, but what is the ideal behavior, and how can we get that. In this case, I think the tradeoffs aren't really worth it.",
      "I agree with all your premises - just not on the conclusion. My opinion, although obviously personal and small, is that you're leaning a bit too much towards academic formality vs. practicality.\r\n\r\n> Currently, applySpec has a type signature that restricts the leaves of the spec to be functions. After this change, the leaves could be anything. Once that happens, we will be special casing the leaves that are functions and not treating them the same as the other value leaves.\r\n\r\nYes. I don't see an issue there. APIs evolve. Again, `applySpec` already treats non-function arguments as if they were something special. And still, that doesn't mean functions are less than first class citizens because of that.\r\n\r\n> The question in modifying the behavior of a function (as opposed to fixing a bug) shouldn't be what changes there are from previous, but what is the ideal behavior, and how can we get that. \r\n\r\nI honestly fail to see how inexplicably transforming a boolean value to `{}` can be \"ideal behavior\".\r\n\r\n```js\r\napplySpec({ b: true })(42); // { b: {} } 🤔 \r\n```\r\n\r\nYes, it's bad input. Yes, it's not complying with the function signature. Is it **ideal**? I'd argue it's far from it. Is the solution proposed in this PR _ideal_? I don't know, probably not! - I'm opening the debate. But, in my view, it's a lot closer to being reasonable.\r\n\r\nI'd rather have a function signature rethought and modified accordingly than trying to debug an API endpoint that started returning things like `{ '0': {} }` for no obvious reason after a sneaky bug in some release.\r\n\r\nMy main concern here is that in order to pursue a purist form, we are relegating use cases and situations that actually _happen_ on a daily basis and have a real impact. \r\n\r\nLet's think for a moment on that hypothetical scenario I started describing above: how many software engineers/developers, when confronted with that kind of bug, do you think are going to come forward and say something like: _\"Oh, I got this! This must be the output of `applySpec`, which uses a special, internal `mapValues` function that calls `keys` to iterate on keys as if all non-function inputs where objects! That's where the `'0': {}` comes from!\"_. \r\n\r\nThe fact that you _need_ to know the internal workings of `ramda` to even be able to diagnose many of the problems is, to me, one of the major pain points of this library (which I ❤️ and use every single day 🙏). I believe we should focus on ironing those and aiding users, rather than punishing when a signature wasn't appropriately followed.",
      "> The fact that you *need* to know the internal workings of `ramda` to even be able to diagnose many of the problems is, to me, one of the major pain points of this library (which I :heart: and use every single day :pray:). \r\n\r\nFixing issues that cause such pain points is fine.  Specific fixes need to be balanced against the the Ramda GIGO philosophy, though.  It's always been a no-hand-holding library, and we tend to err toward the side of \"let the chips fall where they may\" if the user supplies bad input.  But in many cases, when there is a clear way to return something useful in such cases, we will ignore the above and do some sort of type-checking or other ugly code branching.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I believe we should focus on ironing those and aiding users, rather than punishing when a signature wasn't appropriately followed.\r\n\r\nIt's not a matter of punishing users, only of focusing chiefly on those who use Ramda's functions as designed and documented.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBut much more central to Ramda's philosophy is to keep things *simple*.  A function should do one thing and one thing only.\r\n\r\nOften a Ramda function will operate on multiple types, but only if there is a common abstraction that they share.  Thus `map` works on arrays, objects, functions, and other types exactly because they all share the common type of `Functor`.\r\n\r\n`applySpec` is pretty clear now.  It accepts an object representing a tree whose leaf nodes are functions, using this structure to create an object of the same structure by applying those functions to our input values.  The suggested changes add complexity, not only to the implementation, but more importantly, to the API.\r\n\r\nThe concerns from @Bradcomp are real; there would be legitimate fall-out from such a change.  But to me the fundamental issue is one of corrupting a simple function by adding unnecessary complexity.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that this sort of usage of `applySpec` is just barely ok:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst minimum = apply (Math.min), maximum = apply (Math.max)\r\n\r\nconst transform = applySpec ({\r\n  title: always ('Calc Results'),\r\n  type: always ('Statistical'),\r\n  values: identity,\r\n  statistics: {length, sum, mean, maximum, minimum},\r\n})\r\n\r\ntransform ([8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]) //=> \r\n// {\r\n//     title: \"Calc Results\",\r\n//     type: \"Statistical\",\r\n//     values: [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9],\r\n//     statistics: {\r\n//         length: 7,\r\n//         maximum: 9,\r\n//         mean: 5.428571428571429,\r\n//         minimum: 0,\r\n//         sum: 38\r\n//     }\r\n// }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this would be cleaner and clearer:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst transform = pipe (\r\n  applySpec ({\r\n    values: identity,\r\n    statistics: {length, sum, mean, maximum, minimum},\r\n  }),\r\n  mergeRight ({title: 'Calc Results', type: 'Statistical'})\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that this would be merely confusing:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst transform = alternateApplySpec ({\r\n  title: 'Calc Results',\r\n  type: 'Statistical',\r\n  values: identity,\r\n  statistics: {length, sum, mean, maximum, minimum},\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nReading that code, I have no idea what sort of value `mean` or `identity` is.\r\n\r\nSo I'm afraid I'm definitely :-1: on this.",

      "Because this PR breaks existing behavior, I think we should discuss it a little bit.\r\n\r\nWhat _should_ happen in the following case: `R.hasPath([], null)`?\r\n\r\nMy intuitions conflict here, and lead me to wonder whether we should be explicitly testing and accounting for a non-object second parameter (I know this has been litigated before, but the situation has changed with this PR.)\r\n\r\nI am a lot more comfortable saying the empty path should always return true than I am saying a non object testee should always return false. \r\n\r\nThis is because an empty array is still a valid input (Array Idx), and thus we should have a principled return value in that case. In the case of passing a non-object testee, that's a type error per our aspirational signature. It seems like a reasonable case for GIGO, or else throwing. While returning false might make sense as a default, it obviously creates a contradiction with a more reasonable assumption. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I realize that the new behavior is probably preferred, and that removing the tests would be breaking a contract with the user, which is in essence another breaking change, so we are in a little bit of a pickle. I think we thus need to consider the best behavior regardless of the history and move forward with that. My vote is for returning true for the empty path and removing the checks for a non-object, thus most likely leading to an error being thrown. ",
      "@Bradcomp You're absolutely right. I added checks for situations with an empty path and non-object values.",
      "@Bradcomp: I'm really loathe to throw errors if we don't have to.  I like the idea of this change, but hadn't considered the `hasPath([], null)` scenario.\r\n\r\nIn mathematics there are sometimes such contradictions between two different expectations that end up having to be decided in a somewhat arbitrary way.  Raising zero to any power always returns zero.  And raising any value to the zeroth power always returns one.  So what then is zero raised to the zeroth power?  It's answered by making the definitions match the more useful of these expectations.  (Zero to the zeroth power is one)  I think we can do the same here.  If that breaks backward compatibility, we won't release it in a point release.  I would rather get it right than maintain backward compat.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that `hasPath([], val) //=> true` is more fundamental than `hasPath(nodes, null) //=> false`, but I am certainly open to discussion on it. ",
      "@Bradcomp @CrossEye:\r\n\r\nI think we should consider all functions which working with the path and they should work consistently. After a quick review, I found one more interesting behavior: \r\n\r\n```\r\nconst R = require('ramda');\r\n\r\nconsole.log(R.assocPath([], 42, null)); // 42\r\nconsole.log(R.assocPath([], 42, { key: 13 })); // 42\r\n```",

If the path has three nodes, `assocPath` sets the value three layers deep (`{foo: {bar: {baz: 42}}}` )  If it has two nodes, `assocPath` sets it two layers deep (`{foo: {bar: 42}}`.).  If it has one node , `assocPath` sets the value one layer deep (`{foo: 42}`.).  So if the path has no nodes at all, I would expect it so set the value no layers deep, i.e. at the top (`42`.)

One subtlety which may be irrelevant is that I am not actually suggesting we throw, I am saying GIGO.\r\n\r\nIf a person passes a non-object in to `hasPath` I think they are either intentionally relying on ambiguous behavior, or else they have made a coding mistake. Do we want to swallow that?\r\n\r\nThat being said, I am not gonna die on this hill. I _can_ see how people would argue for returning false and that seems OK to me too.

The names parameter is expected to be an array but there is no type checking inside.\r\n\r\nRamda has always preferred to be a no hand-holding library.  We do little type-checking for the user, assuming she knows what she's doing.  \r\n\r\n> 2. When only one attribute needs to be omitted, the names parameter must be written in the array or an unexpected usage will occur.\r\n\r\nRamda strives for simplicity, especially in its public API.  If you haven't seen the classic Rich Hickey talk, *[Simple Made Easy][rh]*, I would highly recommend it.  He describes *complex* as intertwined, and *simple* as the opposite.  Right now, `omit` has the signature `omit :: [String] -> Object -> Object`.  What you're proposing is that it also work as `omit :: String -> Object -> Object`.  One function doing two things means that those concerns are intertwined, and thus the function would be more complex than we prefer.\r\n\r\nThat, for instance, `map` works on Arrays, Objects, and Functions as well as delegating to the `map` methods on types that have one does not contradict this goal of simplicity.  `map` works on the more abstract type of [`Functor`][fu] -- Ramda merely supplies implementations for Arrays, Objects, and Functions.  Note that it doesn't work on Strings because Strings are not Functors.  (An accident of implementation means that it does in fact return a slightly reasonable value, but it doesn't return a String, as `map` should; this again speaks to our no-hand-holding philosophy: *garbage in, garbage out*.)  But there is no obvious type that encompasses both Strings and Arrays of Strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [fu]: https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#functor\r\n  [rh]: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy",
      "> When only one attribute needs to be omitted, the names parameter must be written in the array or an unexpected usage will occur.\r\n\r\nThere is another function in the library, `R.dissoc`, for this purpose. While it might seem odd to have two functions that are so similar, there are a couple reasons for it.\r\n\r\nFirst is the simplicity @CrossEye mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSecondly it allows for some nice symmetry between sets of functions that allows for writing more semantically correct code, and helps discoverability.\r\n\r\n`dissoc` has the opposite function `assoc`, for adding and removing an entry from an object.\r\n`omit` has the opposite function `pick`, for whitelisting and blacklisting object properties."

      "I got in touch with the `Bit` team over Gitter a few months ago, and have been meaning to look into it more thoroughly.  In the meantime, this looks all right to me, although we might want to emphasize that this is not the only way to get individual functions -- you can require or  import them directly from the repository, and tree shaking should work reasonably well.\r\n\r\nWhat do others in @ramda/core think?",
      "Hey, we just recently discovered that tree-shaking doesn't work at all if we basically reexport ramda from another package. I am not sure if it's an issue of `create-react-app` configuration, but we started looking for other solutions.\r\n\r\nThe Bit seems like an interesting way to go, but if I am not mistaken, TypeScript will be an issue here since types are for `ramda` as a whole module. It would be necessary for each individual function in Bit to export its own types.\r\n\r\nTypeScript is really important for us because it's easy to make a typo in some string and having nothing to scream at you right away is a big loss.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor comparison, the material-ui indeed does have types for each individual component, but it's way easier for them because they have each component [typed individually in source code](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/packages/material-ui/src/Tab).\r\n\r\nhttps://bit.dev/mui-org/material-ui/tab/~console",

      "@CrossEye Well, this isn't really about understanding, it's a simple fact that these Bit exports cannot work with it because it's not part of the package. I am not aware of \"easy\" way how to tackle this, unfortunately, but I will try to ask in Bit community.",
      "@FredyC: I know little enough about Typescript (even though I sometimes have to use it) that I don't know what it would mean for it to be \"part of the package\".  I know TS is quite popular, but I've never felt the need.",
      "As I have shown in the case of material-ui, there is an `index.d.ts` with each exported component. I believe the Ramda would have to do the same. I am not sure if there is some better way, I like to use TS, but never got into figuring how it works.\r\n\r\nTS is a great win with Ramda, because it can guard for you eg. `R.prop(\"missing\")` will cause a TS error if that prop actually do not exist on the object. It's a great way to prevent typos and you don't have to rely on thorough tests and/or manual testing."

The rationale for including the function is somewhat the same as for `nAry`.\r\n\r\nFor a real world example of usage, `passport.js` authentication middleware's OAuth2 strategies require a verify callback that receives the user and session information. The function signature is `(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) => void`. In many cases only the profile and cb are used. We can define a verify callback like `const verify = (profile, cb) => cb(null, profile)` and provide it to the middleware as `R.omitArgs(2, verify)`. This helps in keeping the verify function signature clean improves readability and reusability.\r\n\r\nAs for the naming ideas, some alternatives include skipArgs (suggested by a colleague), dropArgs and padArgs.\r\n",

I think `padArgs(2, verify)` makes the most sense there. \r\n\r\nI was trying to come up with a way to get `nAryLeft(4, verify)` to work because that makes sense to me and could be extended to `nAryLeft(1, verify)`, but then what would that mean?

      "@GingerPlusPlus: \r\n> Isn't this equivalent to `curry(compose(then, ifElse))`?\r\n\r\nNo, I don't think so.  I don't think yours would quite work as is, but it looks like an attempt to use Promise-returning consequent and alternative functions.  The original was for a test function that returns a Promise for a boolean with scalar consequent and alternative ones.\r\n\r\n",
      "@sebyul2:\r\n\r\nThis is likely a non-starter for Ramda.  The team is mostly unimpressed with Promises, preferring more lawful types such as Futures or Tasks from repos such as Fluture and Folktale.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons we were glad to introduce `then` and `otherwise` in #2565 was that this meant we no longer had to support any other Promise-related functions.  In #2630 we were able to deprecate `pipeP` and `composeP`; when those go, we'll be down to `then` and `otherwise`, and we can declare a win.\r\n\r\nI don't have a trivial replacement for you, but this isn't too bad:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst ifElseP = (f, g, h) => (a) => then(b => (b ? g : h)(a), f(a))\r\n```\r\n\r\n(possibly with a `curry` wrapped around it if you like, and possibly with `...args` replacing the `a`'s.)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
      "> yours [...] looks like an attempt to use Promise-returning consequent and alternative functions. The original was for a test function that returns a Promise for a boolean with scalar consequent and alternative ones.\r\n\r\nAren't they the same thing, due to auto-flattening, aka `then` being both `chain` and `map`?",
      "@GingerPlusPlus:\r\n\r\nPerhaps.  Maybe I misread what you were suggesting.  I believe that @sebyul2  was looking for this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// delay :: (a -> b) -> a -> Promise b\r\nconst delay = (fn) => (a) => new Promise((res => setTimeout(() => res(fn(a)), 1000)))\r\n\r\n// ifElseP :: (a -> Promise Bool) -> (b -> c) -> (b -> c) -> a -> Promise c\r\nconst ifElseP = (f, g, h) => (a) => then(b => (b ? g : h)(a), f(a))\r\n\r\nconst fn = ifElseP(\r\n  delay(a => a > 10),\r\n  Math.sqrt,\r\n  identity\r\n)\r\n\r\nfn(25).then(console.log) //~> Promise(5)\r\nfn(9).then(console.log)  //~> Promise(9)\r\n```\r\nAnd I thought you were suggesting something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ifElseP :: (a -> Bool) -> (b -> Promise c) -> (b -> Promise c) -> a -> Promise c\r\nconst ifElseP = (f, g, h) => (a) => f(a) ? g(a) : h(a)\r\n\r\nconst fn = ifElseP(\r\n  a => a > 10,\r\n  delay(Math.sqrt),\r\n  delay(identity)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut perhaps you meant something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ifElseP :: (a -> Promise Bool) -> (b -> Promise c)  -> (b -> Promise c) -> a -> Promise c\r\nconst ifElseP = (f, g, h) => (a) => then(b => b ? g(a) : h(a), f(a))\r\n\r\nconst fn = ifElseP(\r\n  delay(a => a > 10),\r\n  delay(Math.sqrt),\r\n  delay(identity)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn any case, none of these seems to match `curry(compose(then, ifElse))`.  Am I missing something?",
      "Thank you for your many comments.\r\n\r\n@CrossEye It worked exactly for me. I have studied. Thank you.",
      "Please close this PR then.\r\n\r\nIn general, @CrossEye, please close PRs that have been \"verbally rejected\" by a core member and have received no activity since, they are just cluttering the list of open PRs.\r\n\r\nIf you're not feeling like it, I volunteer &mdash; during the holidays I'll sift through all the PRs, close the ones that without a doubt should be closed, and attempt to properly label the rest.

Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nMy point is that you can use `then` to lift any unary function to take and return a promise:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// p, f :: a -> Promise b | b\r\n// foo :: a -> Promise b | b\r\nconst foo = ifElse(p, t, f);\r\n\r\n// then :: (a -> Promise b | b) -> Promise a -> Promise b\r\n\r\n// fooP :: Promise a -> Promise b\r\nconst fooP = then(foo)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the `curry(compose` just... composes `then` with `ifElse`, duh.",
      "@GingerPlusPlus: Thank you.  I'm going through the issues and will close a great number of them soon, and open up a discussion about which of the others we want to include in 1.0, and how we want to proceed from there.  I may call for help in a few days if it's not going well.  But I should have some time, as I finish my current job tomorrow and don't start my new one until the new year.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAs to the code under discussion, you are right about the signatures -- I stopped part-way through a transformation from a more specific case to something generic.  I really should have noticed.  And I also hadn't noticed that the second one was in fact just a version of `ifElse`.  :smile:\r\n\r\nAs to the third one, no, I'm pretty sure that what I had is right.  An equivalent with `Promise.prototype.then` rather than `R.then` would be\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst ifElseP = (f, g, h) => (a) => f(a).then(b => b ? g(a) : h(a))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor those following along at home:\r\n\r\n  - **[Version 1][v1]**:\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      // ifElseP :: (a -> Promise Bool) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> b) -> a -> Promise b\r\n      const ifElseP = (f, g, h) => (a) => then(b => (b ? g : h)(a), f(a))\r\n      ```\r\n  - **[Version 2][v2]**:\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      // ifElseP :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Promise b) -> (a -> Promise b) -> a -> Promise b\r\n      const ifElseP = (f, g, h) => (a) => f(a) ? g(a) : h(a)\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  - **[Version 3][v3]**:\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      // ifElseP :: (a -> Promise Bool) -> (a -> Promise b)  -> (a -> Promise b) -> a -> Promise b\r\n      const ifElseP = (f, g, h) => (a) => then(b => b ? g(a) : h(a), f(a))\r\n      ```\r\n\r\nAnd what you're suggesting, I guess, is\r\n\r\n  - **[Version 4][v4]**:\r\n      ```js\r\n      // ifElseP :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Promise b)  -> (a -> Promise b) -> Promise a -> Promise b\r\n      const ifElseP = curry(compose(then, ifElse))\r\n      ```\r\n\r\nwhich is used a bit differently from the others, in that the function returned from `ifElseP` accepts a `Promise a`, not just an `a`.  While that might be an interesting function on it's own, I don't think it has much to do with the original request, which seems to be something like [version 1][v1].\r\n\r\n  [v1]: https://goo.gl/gRjgcD\r\n  [v2]: https://goo.gl/aXZjAt\r\n  [v3]: https://goo.gl/x9e9Nr\r\n  [v4]: https://goo.gl/ULxYPL\r\n\r\n",
      "Ok, I understand the third one now, and it's the same as the first one, due to `g(a) : h(a), f(a) === (b ? g : h)(a)`, signature: `(a -> Promise Bool) -> (a -> Promise b | b)  -> (a -> Promise b | b) -> a -> Promise b`.\r\n\r\nI also see how 4th differs from them -- predicate function is `a -> Bool`, not `a -> Promise Bool`.\r\n\r\nAnd while the original implementation is messy, due to concerning itself with variadic functions, perhaps the 1st or 3rd deserves to be put in the cookbook.\r\n\r\nAnd while providing more support to just promises is not what the Ramda team wants, perhaps there is a occasional need for `ifElseWith`, similar to `pipeWith`.",
      "Yes, a cookbook implementation makes sense.\r\n\r\nSince this is the very first request I've seen for something like this, I'm not inclined to spend any effort on `ifElseWith`, but if someone created a PR, we could certainly give a look.\r\n\r\nIt's funny after all those versions that I still hadn't noticed that 1 and 3 were the same.  It's that damn `chain`/`map` combination.  If `then` were more sensible, a specialization of version 1 where `b` is `Promise c`  would yield `Promise Promise c`."

[x] In transformations<sup>1</sup>, when dispatching, use transducers when Map, array or object is passed as input.\r\n2. [x] Get rid of redundant array and object specializations.\r\n3. [ ] Ensure that `reduceBy` (and derived functions) works with keyed transducers.\r\n4. [ ] Get rid of legacy `(result, [key, value]) => result` signature from [`_stepCatObject`'s `step`](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/2622/files#diff-c78dd3dc852a1f37454e6a9c243cf6fcR33).\r\n4.

It takes an `fn` function and returns a new function that asks for arguments before returning a third function that, when called, invokes `fn` with the provided arguments.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst thunkify = fn => (...args) => () => fn(...args);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOriginal PR idea came from @CrossEye at a [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50495874/how-to-create-a-function-that-delays-call-to-given-function?noredirect=1#comment88255490_50495874).\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n- While very simple, wrapping functions to delay their invocations is a really common pattern.\r\n- Ramda itself does not provide any out-of-the-box tool to help with this in a straight forward manner.\r\n- It is specially useful when arguments to the _thunkified_ function are **not known until a later execution stage**.\r\n- It helps with creating composable functions that get arguments from composed chains.\r\n- The `fn` function could be variadic and can be called by the thunk with any number of arguments.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nThis has been adapted from a real world application I'm currently working on.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction throwErrorWith(message, data) {\r\n  throw Object.assign(new Error(message), data);\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst thenThrowErrorWith = R.thunkify(throwErrorWith);\r\n\r\n// ...later\r\n\r\nconst throwIfBadFormat = unless(\r\n  validFormat,\r\n  thenThrowErrorWith(\r\n    'Invalid response format: expected one of <result></result> or <error></error>'\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome considerations:\r\n\r\n- Not very keen on the `thunkify` name, to be honest.\r\n- This is my first PR on the project. My knowledge of the internal functions is rather limited, so I'm far from sure if this is the current \"Ramda\" approach to writing the solution. \r\n- There might be better ways and/or other internals I should be using. Looking forward to your input!\r\n- I'm not very familiar with Haskell-like signatures so wasn't quite sure how to describe `thunkify`. Help appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "👋 Hello! First time contributor here so let me know what idiomatic Ramda repo things I'm missing from these changes and I'll be more than happy to make updates ASAP.\r\n\r\nI was using `R.invoker` on a `node@8.11.1` project and discovered that it was incorrectly throwing when I would try to invoke an `async` function on an object. Here's a basic example of what I was doing:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst person = {\r\n  speak: async () => 'Hi!'\r\n};\r\nconst speak = R.invoker(0, 'speak');\r\nspeak(person).then(R.identity) //=> 'Hi!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis [works fine in the Ramda Repl](https://goo.gl/g7WxPS) because `Object.prototype.toString` seems to always give back `'[object Function]'`. In `node@8.11.1` however, `toString` gives back different strings for different types of functions and this was producing false negatives when I tried to use `R.invoker` on my `async` methods.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `AsyncFunction`, as well as `GeneratorFunction` ~and `Proxy`~ functions. I took a page out of `lodash`'s [`isFunction` implementation](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/4.17.5/lodash.js#L11638).\r\n\r\nI didn't add any tests because I didn't see any specific tests for the internal `_isFunction` helper, nor could I easily add tests for `R.invoker` that handles `async` functions because of the `ESLint@2.11.0` dev dependency. I see in the `travis.yml` file that you're targeting `node@8.x.x` so I think the changes are valid given that support.",

It works by sending subscribers a few open issues in their inbox. If subscribers get busy, there is an algorithm that backs off issue load so they do not get overwhelmed\n\n[Read more about the CodeTriage project](https://www.codetriage.com/what).\n\n## Why am I getting this PR?\n\nYour project was picked by the human, @schneems. They selected it from the projects submitted to https://www.codetriage.com and hand edited the PR. How did your project get added to [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/what)? Roughly 5 months ago, [@chrislaughlin](https://github.com/chrislaughlin) added this project to CodeTriage in order to start contributing. Since then, 3 people have subscribed to help this repo.\n\n## What does adding a badge accomplish?\n\nAdding a badge invites people to help contribute to your project. It also lets developers know that others are invested in the longterm success and maintainability of the project.\n\nYou can see an example of a CodeTriage badge on these popular OSS READMEs:\n\n- [![](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/rails/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/rails) https://github.com/rails/rails\n- [![](https://www.codetriage.com/crystal-lang/crystal/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/crystal-lang/crystal) https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal\n\n## Have a question or comment?\n\nWhile I am a bot, this PR was manually reviewed and monitored by a human - @schneems. My job is writing commit messages and handling PR logistics.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can reply back to this PR and they will be answered by @schneems. If you do not want a badge right now, no worries, close the PR, you will not hear from me again.\n\nThanks for making your project Open Source! Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",

If the type *does implement fantasy-land/traverse*, sequence will defer to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo write the tests for this, I had to implement `Traversable` on something. I chose `Maybe` since it is what is used in the original issue that inspired me to create this PR, and `Id` already has `sequence`, so I wouldn't have been able to write *failing tests first*. To implement Traversable, I also added Foldable, but only for \"correctness\" since `reduce` isn't used in any tests.\r\n\r\nThis would fix the bug in #2243 ",

I'd like to highlight it in the document. \r\n\r\nIn order to do lazy evaluation with `R.transcue`, we could compose with functions that return `R.reduced` in the transducer for termination, such as `R.take`. But what's important is that the execution order of the composed functions is from left to right, which is the opposite order when calling the transducer directly. \r\n\r\nFor instance\r\n```\r\nvar numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\r\nvar transducer = R.compose(R.map(R.add(1)), R.take(2));\r\n```\r\nIf I call the `transducer` directly like this `transducer(numbers)`, then `R.take(2)` will be executed first, then `R.map(R.add(1))` , which is \"right to left\" order\r\nIf I call the `transducer` with `R.transduce` like this:\r\n```\r\nR.transduce(transducer, R.flip(R.append), [], numbers); //=> [2, 3]\r\n```\r\nthen `R.map(R.add(1))` will be executed first, `R.take(2)` next, which is \"left to right\" order.\r\n\r\nHowever since `map f . take x == take x . map f`, regardless \"left to right\" or \"right to left\" order, they both yield to the same result. \r\n\r\nThe current document uses this as the example, I think it's not clear enough for reader to notice the execution order of the composed transducers, as well as the lazy evaluation feature.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I'm trying to make it more clear by adding one more example so that the reader will see transducers are exeucted from left to right. That is, `R.filter(isOdd)` will be executed first, then `R.take(1)` will terminate before traversing to the end of the array. The other way round won't make sense.\r\n\r\nPlease review. Thanks!",

I was thinking for a long time how to name it, it's not like reduce as you can't collect data on the way (it would make it more complex but it could be useful to add it as well - the same flow but passing starting value). The only thing it's similar to is `anyPass` but that's not perfect either. `T` suffix is a guess - big time.\r\n\r\nI know that implementation is probably not utilising half of the methods that you are using in your files but tried my best and made it browser friend (apply instead of spread etc) - I need to start somewhere.\r\n\r\nI'm keen to get your opinion.\r\n\r\nPS. 5 starts for contributors guide - just easy to do it!",

    "body": "This attempts to provide a solution to the situation described in https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/2083.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a ramda-core in which each function provides a core set of features that can be imported and composed to build additional features from there. This way, there can be how many different flavors of ramda-like libraries you would want.\r\n\r\nThe current PR takes the map function as an example. Like so, each function takes a (dispatcher, config, dispatchable, however you want to call it) which takes the core features which the core function provides and builds from there. The new map core function showed would only map over native arrays and objects. Then there are two different dispatchers: one adds all the rest of the features that the current ramda/map has and the other one does not (it does not support transducers, currying with placeholders or function composition via map) while providing additional functionality (dispatches to fantasy-land first and then to the map method).\r\n\r\nThis way you would import (from npm or repo) all the functions in ramda-core, partially apply them with the functionality you want and publish it. In the example provided I would publish a \"ramda-fantasy-light\" package or something like that. You could publish a flavor which only dispatches to fantasy-land methods (call it \"ramda-dictatorship\") or another one that dispatches to the method as is (call it \"ramda-anarchy\"). You could, as well, take the opportunity provide maybe/either wrapped functions and/or add some monads implementations or whatnot for a comprehensive fp toolbox.\r\nAlso, it would make more sense to publish individual lightweight functions a la lodash (eg: \"ramda.filter\").\r\n\r\nAll in all, I hope, would make ramda more focused, flexible, faster and shareable.\r\n\r\nPS:\r\n1) Although I've not read all of the source code to guarantee that all the transducer and default currying can be decoupled without major issues, I'm optimistic.\r\n2) Some test of external functions may fail probably because I hardcoded (temporarily as a proof of concept) a piece of transducer dispatch (commented in code).\r\n\r\n",

Fixed.) \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that if we are going to get out of the business of dispatching, then we should do it wholeheartedly.  That means we should stop doing any dispatching whatsoever.\r\n## What is the proposal?\r\n\r\nRemove all dispatching.  The only types Ramda functions should operate upon are the ones it handles internally: lists, functions, objects, strings.  This means removing silly dispatching like `dropRepeatsWhile` that was only dispatching because of implementation details of our transducers, removing more useful dispatching like `filter`, which could easily work with user types such as trees as well as the built-in types, and removing quite common dispatching such as `map` that is part of the [FantasyLand Functor](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#functor) specification.\r\n## Does this make Ramda less powerful?\r\n\r\nNo, Ramda will still operate directly on the same types it always has, especially lists, often functions or plain objects, sometimes strings.  And a user [can still use Ramda](https://goo.gl/9ZglGJ) to call her custom type:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nconst fmap = R.invoker(1, 'map');\r\nfmap(square, Just(5)); //=> Just(25)\r\nfmap(square, Nothing()); //=> Nothing()\r\n```\r\n## Does this make Ramda less ergonomic?\r\n\r\nIt does, to an extent that depends on how much the user likes points-free style.  Perhaps a simple example is the change in the test for `composeK`:\r\n\r\n**before**\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nR.compose(chain(h), chain(g), chain(f))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**after**\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nR.compose(x => x.chain(h), x => x.chain(g), x => x.chain(f))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is not horrible, it does make using Ramda less pleasant.\r\n## Are you serious?\r\n\r\nPartly.  It seems to me that we're headed very much in the wrong direction by removing dispatching.  (This is not exactly a reaction to #1949; some of the things we dispatch make little sense.)  I believe dispatching is one of the very good parts of Ramda.  But if we're going to remove it, I don't see any good reason to make an exception for the FantasyLand types.\r\n\r\nMy preference is still to stick with our dispatching.  But I'm not interested in a half-measure of removing the dispatching of everything but those functions currently supported by some other team.  I don't want our API to be subject to the whims of another project.\r\n\r\nI'm sure this PR is incomplete.  I pulled it together in an hour, so it may be fairly low quality.  And since I last was online, other code has been merged that means that I'd have to rebase before we could even try to merge it.  That's ok.  I want to see where the conversation goes anyway.\r\n",

As a result, we can't have functions which support transducers but do _not_ dispatch, leading to silliness such as `R.dropRepeatsWith` dispatching to `dropRepeatsWith`. It's thus unclear whether we actually _intend_ a certain function to dispatch.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to take an array of method names rather than a string. This will give us the freedom to have a function work with transducers without also dispatching. It will also give us the option of dispatching to one of _several_ possible methods (e.g. `fantasy-land/map` or `map`).\n\nAt this stage the pull request does not actually remove dispatching. What I will do is comment on each of the functions in question and request that you vote :thumbsup: if you believe the function should continue to dispatch; :thumbsdown: otherwise. As we decide which functions should no longer dispatch I will update the pull request.\n",

Prior to that change, the _actual_ type of the function was:\n\n``` haskell\nintersectionWith :: ((a, b) -> Boolean) -> [a] -> [b] -> [a]\n```\n\nPost optimization, the order in which arguments are provided to predicate is determined by the lengths of the input lists rather than the order in which the lists are provided to `intersectionWith`. This means that the function only behaves _reliably_ when treated as:\n\n``` haskell\nintersectionWith :: ((a, a) -> Boolean) -> [a] -> [a] -> [a]\n```\n\nThis makes the function much less useful: if `a` has sensible equality semantics we can simply use `intersection`. The example in the [documentation](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#intersectionWith) is better expressed in terms of `intersection`. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\n\nLet's set aside the question of the usefulness of the old behaviour, though. There's a more important matter to discuss, which is our process for handling regressions. Our current process seems to be:\n1.  Regression.\n2.  Discuss the merits of the regression.\n3.  Fix the regression, perhaps.\n\nThis is not right. All else being equal we rightly favour a function's existing behaviour. The onus is therefore on the contributor proposing a change in behaviour to clearly demonstrate the benefits. Our current process means that when we unintentionally change the behaviour of a function the new behaviour becomes the incumbent and one must make a case for reinstating the old behaviour.\n\nI'd like us to follow this process instead:\n1.  Regression.\n2.  Fix the regression.\n3.  Discuss the merits of the regression, if applicable.\n\nAfter discussing the merits of a regression, we may decide we actually stumbled upon a better function. We can then make a pull request to formalize the change, making any necessary documentation changes. This will also make it clear to others and to our future selves that the change was intentional, and provide a document to which the upgrade guide can link.\n",

In most cases a humble wrapper function does the job equally well. When more than one \"adjustment\" is necessary, a wrapper function is much clearer. Imagine, for example, that we have a function `f` which takes three arguments, the last of which is optional.

Which of the following is clearer?\n\n``` javascript\nconst g = R.flip(R.binary(f));\n```\n\n``` javascript\nconst g = (x, y) => f(y, x);\n```\n\nThe `g` defined in the second case is not curried, of course, but this could be achieved by applying `R.curry` to the wrapper function if desired. Still, I find the second case easier to parse.\n",

    "body": "This is PR is just an experiment at this point. But I really think it would be useful -- or maybe there's a better way of dealing with my issues. [This discussion](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/1481) didnt get too far, so let me rephrase some things.\n\nIn the big picture, I want to find some way of [optimizing a \"listOf\" higher-order component **in a pure functional way**.](https://github.com/ccorcos/elmish/blob/master/src/ui/listOf.js)  (it may make more sense if you just [browse through these](https://github.com/ccorcos/elmish/tree/master/tutorial)). This consists of (1) being able to lazily build, difference, and evaluate trees in an idiomatic fashion and (2) being able to compare bound functions as if they're referentially transparent to satisfy the first point.\n\nLets start with the second point. Here's a simple example using React:\n\n``` js\nconst Counter = React.createClass({\n  render() {\n    const inc = () => this.props.update(this.props.value + 1)\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <span>{this.props.value}</span>\n        <button onClick={inc}>inc</button>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nconst ListOfCounters = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState() {\n    return {numbers: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]}\n  },\n  update(i, value) {\n    this.setState(R.evolve({\n      numbers: R.update(i, value)\n    }, this.state))\n  },\n  render() {\n    const update = (i) => (value) => this.update(i, value)\n    const counter = (value, i) => <Counter value={value} update={update(i)}/>\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {this.state.numbers.map(counter)}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe issue here is that whenever a single counter changes, all counters need to re-render. Thats because the `update` prop to each counter has a new reference. One solution is to make a custom `shouldComponentUpdate` that ignores the comparison of the `update` prop. But there are more complicated scenarios where this isn't a good thing to do, for example, if the list could add and remove counters so the indexes change. What would be amazing though, is if you could use `R.equals` to compare new props and `R.equals` can compare functions _as if they're referentially transparent_. And the only change that would need to be made to the logic (other than changing `shuoldCompnentUpdate` to use `R.equals`) above is:\n\n``` js\nconst update = R.curry(this.update)\n```\n\nThats because we're able to keep track of the original function and any bound arguments thus far. \n\nNow, `R.curry` isn't the only place you'd want this kind of functionality. Maybe you just want a thunk to call a function with some arguments. For example:\n\n``` js\nconst ListOfCounters = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState() {\n    return {numbers: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]}\n  },\n  update(i) {\n    this.setState(R.evolve({\n      numbers: R.adjust(i, R.inc)\n    }, this.state))\n  },\n  render() {\n    const counter = (value, i) => {\n      const inc = () => this.update(i)\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <span>{value}</span>\n          <button onClick={inc}>inc</button>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {this.state.numbers.map(counter)}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIn this case, you don't exactly want to curry, but you want to return a `thunk`. So perhaps we could have a function called `R.thunk` or maybe we could just use `R.partial`. But the point is that we have a function that is bound to an argument. And so long as we're using pure functional programming patterns, then there should be no harm in partially applied functions being referentially transparent. That is:\n\n``` js\nR.equals(R.partial(f, 1), R.partial(f, 1))\n```\n\nObviously they won't truely be referentially transparent in JavaScript, but that's why we have Ramda, right?\n\nThis leads me back to the first point... React lazily evaluates the virtual dom tree because when you create a component like `<Counter value={value} update={update}/>`, the JSX compiles into `React.createElement(Counter, {value, update})` which in turn returns some sort of object like `{type: Counter, props: {value, update}}`. When React is evaluating the vdom to see if there are any updates, it first sees if we want to render the same component (Counter), and then compares the props to see if a re-render is needed. The thing that bugs me about this is that this format is so specific to React. Sure, we could copy it, but I think theres a much more idiomatic way of accomplishing all of this.\n\nSuppose our components are \"stateless components\" as React would call it, or just functions. What we really want here is a thunk like we talked about before.\n\n```\nconst thunk = R.partial(render, props)\n```\n\nIf we call `thunk()` we'll get back the vdom tree thats returned from render. But if we want to lazily evaluate the vdom tree, we can simply use `R.equals` to compare thunks to determine if anything has changed. \n\nWhat I really like about this approach is its more generic feeling--its just a function with bound arguments. In an academic, functional, pure world, there's no reason bound functions shouldnt be referentially transparent. As I've been getting more and more familiar with functional programming, this has always been the limiting factor as far as complexity/performance in javascript, esp in my [elmish](https://github.com/ccorcos/elmish) project where I'm building similar lazy trees for things like http requests and side-effects other than just the vdom.\n\nMaybe I'm just too far down the rabbit hole, but I hope that all makes sense. I'm very interested to hear some of your thoughts.\n\nCheers\n",

    "body": "### Motivation\n\nI very often need to group elements of a list and immediately apply some transformation to the grouped sub-lists or their elements. It’s usually quite ineffective to do it in two steps (requires another loop with nested loop and intermediate arrays).\n\nI’m quite sure that it’s very common need so there _must be_ some “standard” name for such function. I’ve tried to find something in Haskell, but without success. Eventually I found a function named `reduceBy` which does what I need in these two libs:\n- [itertoolz.reduceby](http://toolz.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#toolz.itertoolz.reduceby) (Python), \n- [CloudFlow.reduceBy](https://github.com/mbraceproject/MBrace.Core/blob/7de07474e7ed32adc90a66c93c6e8fa279577a14/src/MBrace.Flow/Combinators.fs#L646-L666) (F#).\n#### Example 1\n\n``` js\nconst students = [\n  { name: 'Lucy', score: 92 },\n  { name: 'Drew', score: 85 },\n  // ...\n  { name: 'Bart' score: 62 },\n]\nconst grade = (n) => (n < 65) ? 'F' : (n < 70) ? 'D' : (n < 80) ? 'C' : (n < 90) ? 'B' : 'A'\nconst byGrade = R.pipe(R.prop('score'), grade)\n\n// A. Using R.groupBy and nested pair of R.map:\nconst namesByGrade = R.pipe(\n  R.groupBy(byGrade),\n  R.map(R.map(R.prop('name')))\n)\n\n// B. Using new R.reduceBy:\nconst namesByGrade = R.reduceBy(byGrade, (acc, stud) => acc.concat(stud.name), [])\n\nnamesByGrade(students)\n// {\n//   'A': ['Lucy'],\n//   'B': ['Drew'],\n//   // ...\n//   'F': ['Bart'],\n// }\n```\n#### Example 2\n\n``` js\nconst tweets = [\n  { author: '@drboolean', text: 'Lorem ipsum', favs: 60 },\n  { author: '@dan_abramov', text: 'dolor sit amet', favs: 80 },\n  { author: '@drboolean', tex: 'consectetur', favs: 40 },\n  // ...\n]\n\n// A. Using R.groupBy, R.map and nested R.reduce:\nconst sumFavsByUser = R.pipe(\n  R.groupBy(R.prop('author')),\n  R.map(R.reduce((acc, tw) => acc + tw.favs))\n)\n\n// B. Using new R.reduceBy:\nconst sumFavsByUser = R.reduceBy(R.prop('author'), (acc, tw) => acc + tw.favs, 0)\n\nsumFavsByUser(tweets)\n// {\n//    '@drboolean': 100,\n//    '@dan_abramov': 80,\n// }\n```\n### Transducer?\n\nI’ve implemented also `_xreduceBy` transducer, but I’m not sure how to use it (and so how to test it). How can be `groupBy` used with `R.transduce` or `R.into`?\n\n<a name=\"poll\" />\n### Poll\n\n| Name | Vote |\n| --- | --- |\n| @davidchambers | [:+1:](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/1598#issuecomment-173035182) |\n| @buzzdecafe | [:open_hands:](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/1598#issuecomment-175007799) (neutral) |\n| @CrossEye | [:+1:](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/1598#issuecomment-177531934) |\n| @scott-christopher | [:+1:](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/pull/1598#issuecomment-178314222) |\n| @raine | :question: |\n",

This should remove some extra GC thrashing when used in a tight loop too, such as those often in benchmark code.\n\nI've included a new benchmark file for `R.contains` and run it against the previous implementations, resulting in the following:\n\n| Implementation | Hz | Margin of Error |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| v0.8 | 73,693 | ±1.31% |\n| Set | 341,266 | ±0.66% |\n| indexOf (this PR) | 11,372,373 | ±0.84% |\n| nativeIndexOf | 13,820,992 | ±0.63% |\n",

Also, this makes possible to work with \n_infinite_ list similar to other functional languages.\n\nNew API to create a generator:\n\n``` js\nxrange:: Number -> Number -> Number -> Generator\nxrange(step, start, stop) -> Generator\n```\n\nA Infinite list can be created by passing `stop = Infinity`. Example:\n\n``` js\nconst natural = R.xrange(1, 1, Infinity);\n```\n\nPlain JS array can be extracted from a generator based list using `R.take`. Example:\n\n``` js\nR.take(10, natural); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\nComposition also works.\n\n``` js\n// List first 10 even squares\nR.take(10, R.filter(x => x % 2 === 0, R.map(x => x * x, natural)));\n```\n\n`R.zip` can be used to zip 2 infinite list or (1 infinite with 1 finite list):\n\n``` js\nconst even = R.xrange(2, 2, Infinity);\nconst natural = R.xrange(1, 1, Infinity);\n\nR.take(3, R.zip(natural, even)); // [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]]\nR.zip(natural, ['a', 'b', 'c']); // [[1, 'a'], [2, 'b'], [3, 'c']]\n```\n\n`R.repeat` can be used to create infinitely repeating values:\n\n``` js\nR.take(5, R.repeat(1, Infinity)); // [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n```\n\n`R.times` can be used to create an infinite list. Example, an infinite stream\nof random values:\n\n``` js\nR.take(5, R.times(Math.random, Infinity));\n```\n\nThe following functions have been modified to work with generators:\n- head, nth\n- tail, slice\n- uniq, uniqWith\n- reduce\n- reverse\n- length\n- splitEvery\n- forEach\n- filter\n- map\n- zip\n- take\n\nWill work on other functions if people see value in this PR.\n",

    "body": "This pull request deprecates `R.commute` and `R.commuteMap` in favour of `R.sequence` and `R.traverse` respectively.\n\nReasons to rename the functions:\n- My understanding is that `sequence` and `traverse` are the most common names for these functions. I read and reread [Understanding traverse and sequence](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/elevated-world-4/) in order to come to terms with this concept, so I may be biased by the names used there. Is `commute` the name used anywhere but in Ramda?\n- Fantasy Land defines [Traversable](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#traversable), which requires that a Traversable provide a `sequence` method. It also shows that `traverse` can be derived from `map` and `sequence`.\n- Currently each Ramda functions which dispatches has the same name as the method to which it dispatches. Having `R.commute` dispatch to `sequence` would break this convention.\n\nChanges:\n- `R.sequence` dispatches; `R.commute` does not.\n- `R.traverse` takes `(of, f, traversable)` rather than `(f, of, traversable)`. It's more likely one would apply several different `f` transformations to a single :twisted_rightwards_arrows: type inversion than apply the same transformation to several different type inversions. I also like having `of` off to the side as it conveys type information that would be unnecessary in the presence of type inference.\n\nI'm particularly interested in hearing from @scott-christopher, who has a better grasp of this than I do. We have discussed these changes (though Scott is happy to keep the names) but I'm not sure that I've done everything correctly.\n\nI'm about to :airplane: from Auckland to San Francisco, so I'll be offline for the next 12 hours or so.\n",

I'm not going to go over all the rationale for again; we've discussed it a few times, most recently in #1067, especially starting with my long comment, https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/1067#issuecomment-135923353.  This at least gives us something concrete to discuss.\n\nThere is a perhaps peculiar design decision here.  I'll understand if there are objections; I'm certainly not wedded to it.  Namely, `keys` is simply a reference to `internal/_sortedKeys`.  It adds nothing whatsoever.  The reason for this is that I want to have the `sortedKeys` name used very explicitly.  I want it to be quite clear when we are using that rather than the unsorted version.  But we still want the public API to be `keys`.  There was also one other concern that turned out not to be relevant, but which I always keep in the back of my head.  I really prefer not to have internal modules depend upon the public ones.  I want the dependencies to always run in one direction, the way one might think about layering an application.  It turned out not to be an issue here, as there was no internals that depended on `keys`.  (And of course this same decision applies to `keysIn` / `sortedKeysIn`.) \n",

Doing so would prevent reuse for potential hypothetical functions like `mergeIntersection`.~~\n- ~~to support filtering, the implementation currently excludes keys from the resulting object whose values are `undefined` – this feels like it overloads the behaviour of `mergeWith`/`mergeWithKeys` a little.~~\n\n_edit_: I've since removed `internal/_mergeWith`, moving the implementation into `mergeWithKeys` and I've also removed the behaviour of filtering `undefined` values.\n",

This is not reckless overloading: it makes sense, as I hope to demonstrate.\n- In the early days very few Ramda functions were polymorphic. I imagine this was a reaction to the many useful but unprincipled polymorphic functions in Underscore.\n- Over time various Ramda functions have been granted the ability to dispatch to appropriately named methods, allowing Ramda's list functions to be applied to values which are not necessarily array-like.\n- In recent times Haskell and Fantasy Land have influenced the way certain Ramda contributors view polymorphic functions. Rather than view polymorphic functions as complected, this contingent sees them as useful higher-level abstractions over _groups_ of types (_type classes_ in Haskell terminology), provided they are principled (i.e. satisfy laws).\n- Thinking in terms of groups of types encouraged us to define `R.empty` for Object and String in #1236, and then to define `R.isEmpty` in terms of `R.empty` in #1242.\n- This same thought process led to define `R.map` for Function in #1408.\n\n`R.map` is no longer a function which operates only on array-like objects. It should operate on any functor. User-defined types such as Maybe can simply provide a `map` method, but Ramda must provide the `map` definition for each built-in type which is a functor: Array, Function, and Object.\n",

The common theme among many of these functions is that they are essentially gluing together the results of different functions in different ways. If we implement Functor and Applicative for functions then we get this behavior for free.\n\n``` haskell\ninstance Functor ((->) r) where\n    fmap = (.)\n\ninstance Applicative ((->) a) where\n    pure = const\n    (<*>) f g x = f x (g x)\n```\n\nThe following simplifications become possible\n- `R.both` -> `R.lift(R.and)`\n- `R.either` -> `R.lift(R.or)`\n- `R.negate` -> `R.lift(R.not)`\n- `R.converge` -> `R.lift`\n\nThere are 2 issues that I ran into\n\nWhat to do about converging functions that take multiple arguments, for example: \n\n``` javascript\nconst f = R.converge((a, b) => a + b, a => a, (a, b) => a);\nf.length; // 2\n```\n\nRight now `ap` just assumes there will only be one argument supplied to a function (but I could easily change it to apply the function to the entire arguments object). `R.converge` takes the max length of all of the functions but it can only do this because it knows the length of both input functions at the same time. If you were to perform the equivalent operation with `R.lift` you'd supply the input functions 1 at a time (although both at once is possible as well):\n\n``` javascript\nconst g = R.lift((a, b) => a + b); \n// g :: (Applicative f, Num c) => f c -> f c -> f c\nconst h = g(a => a); // should the function returned have length 1 now? How do you keep track of that? \n// h :: (Applicative f, Num c) => f c -> f c\nconst i = h((a, b) => a); // should the function returned have length 2 now?\n```\n\nI think the simplest solution is just to make `R.both`, `R.either`, etc. just take unary functions as arguments and call it a day.\n\nThe second problem is around preserving context but it seems like that has already been figured out for converge, I'm just not sure how to add it in to `R.map` and `R.ap`.\n",

    "body": "This is a second attempt at simplifying Ramdas logical functions. The first attempt is #1218.\n\nThis PR makes the following changes:\n- `and` and `or` does not dispatch. This didn't receive any resistance in the first PR so I want repeat the arguments.\n- `and` and `or` are now documented as if they only worked on booleans. We no longer advertise that you can pass non-logical values to these logical functions. They are both documented with a truth table which is how these functions are [often defined in math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction#Truth_table).\n- `defaultTo` now returns it first argument if it's last argument is `NaN`.\n\nThese changes are made to achieve the following advantages:\n- `and` and `or` are now semantically significantly simpler since they don't reference the quite complex and arbitrary concepts \"truthy\" and \"falsy\". The denotation (the meaning) of these functions are now equal to their counterparts in math. I believe simple denotation is a fundamental to functional programming (some people even prefer the term denotational programming to functional programming).\n- `and` and `or` are now _single purpose_ functions. This makes code clearer and more explicit. This is not enforced in code, only in documentation.\n- `defaultTo` now handles `NaN` this makes it more useful in many cases (for instance with `parseInt`) and removes the need to misuse `or` to achieve the same. Using `defaultTo` is also safer. Consider code like this `R.or(parseInt(student.score), 40)`. This would result in an unexpected behavior if the result of `parseInt(student.score)` returned `0`. `defaultTo` does not suffer from this problem.\n\nI would also like to point out that the current behavior of `defaultTo` appears to [surprise people](https://gitter.im/ramda/ramda?at=55b8f72e4c04f0cc22e73104).\n\nThis PR would make it possible to replace code like this (an example by @CrossEye in the previous PR)\n\n``` js\nR.map(student => R.assoc('grade', R.or(parseInt(student.score), 0), student), students);\n```\n\nWith this code that better expresses the intent and doesn't rely on a multi-purpose `or`.\n\n``` js\nR.map(student => R.assoc('grade', R.defaultTo(0, parseInt(student.score)), student), students);\n```\n",

    "body": "After the last wonderful change to `equals` it appears that we are no longer fixed on implementing the flaws of JavaScript's operators in our equivalent functions.\n\nThis PR implements `and` and `or` functions with simple sensible semantics and without type coercion.\n\nWe _might_ consider throwing if non-boolean arguments are received since JavaScript programmers are somewhat used to the crazy semantics of `&&` and `||`.\n\nI also took out dispatching. This case is actually a perfect example of how harmful dispatching is! Dispatching was originally added in #1015 since @davidchambers wanted to use it with Sanctuary. The reasoning was that it would make it possible to write code like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar a = S.Just(true);\nvar b = S.Nothing();\nR.or(a, b);  // => S.Just(true);\n```\n\nBut that is the wrong way to achieve the goal. The correct way is this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar a = S.Just(true);\nvar b = S.Nothing();\nR.lift(R.or)(a, b);\n```\n\nAt first the difference might not look like much – but it is _huge_. The first code relies on a magic correspondence between dispatching in `R.or` and a method named `or` on `a` and `b`. It forces users into _thinking_ and _knowing_ about dispatching at a low level.\n\nIn the second code however the only thing that matters is that `a` and `b` are applicatives. We could swap out `a` and `b` with _any_ applicative and the code would still work!\n\nIn other words the first code is an example of brittle code that relies on implementation details and only pretends to be general but really isn't. The second code however is an example of actually general code where one only works on abstract types specified by well defined interfaces.\n\nOnce again dispatching deceives us away from proper abstractions.\n\nRemoving the dispatching also means that we and only us decides the semantics of `or` and `and`. Third party libraries can no longer overload it with additional meaning and complexity.\n",

In the new API one never interacts directly with the return value, one simply provides it as an argument to `R.view`, `R.set`, or `R.over`.\n\nThe helper functions `R.lensProp` and `R.lensIndex` remain unchanged:\n\n``` javascript\nvar addressLens = R.lensProp('address');    var addressLens = R.lensProp('address');\nvar headLens = R.lensIndex(0);              var headLens = R.lensIndex(0);\n```\n\nLenses are now just functions, so `R.composeL` and `R.pipeL` are no longer necessary:\n\n``` javascript\nvar streetLens =                            var streetLens =\nR.composeL(headLens, addressLens);          R.compose(addressLens, headLens);\n```\n\nNote that `R.compose` reads left-to-right here. It's way too late for me to reason about this. :)\n\nThe following examples will use this data structure:\n\n``` javascript\nvar alice = {\n  name: 'Alice Jones',\n  address: ['22 Walnut St', 'San Francisco', 'CA']\n};\n```\n#### `view`\n\n``` javascript\nnameLens(alice);                            R.view(nameLens, alice);\n// => 'Alice Jones'                         // => 'Alice Jones'\n\nstreetLens(alice);                          R.view(streetLens, alice);\n// => '22 Walnut St'                        // => '22 Walnut St'\n```\n#### `set`\n\n``` javascript\nnameLens.set('Alice Smith', alice);         R.set(nameLens, 'Alice Smith', alice);\n// => { name: 'Alice Smith'                 // => { name: 'Alice Smith'\n//    , address: [ '22 Walnut St'           //    , address: [ '22 Walnut St'\n//               , 'San Francisco'          //               , 'San Francisco'\n//               , 'CA' ] }                 //               , 'CA' ] }\n```\n#### `over`\n\n``` javascript\nstreetLens.map(R.toUpper, alice);           R.over(streetLens, R.toUpper, alice);\n// => { name: 'Alice Jones'                 // => { name: 'Alice Jones'\n//    , address: [ '22 WALNUT ST'           //    , address: [ '22 WALNUT ST'\n//               , 'San Francisco'          //               , 'San Francisco'\n//               , 'CA' ] }                 //               , 'CA' ] }\n```\n\nThis API feels more in keeping with the rest of the library (returning a function with two functions attached is rather odd). Also, removing the need for special composition functions is very nice indeed.\n\nI'm opening this pull request for discussion. If we decide we like this change I'll spend some time writing documentation and figuring out the type signatures!\n\nMany thanks to @tel for walking me through the various approaches to creating lenses. The existence of this pull request suggests I absorbed at least some of the information. ;)\n\n/cc @joneshf, Master of Lenses\n",

Avoiding the postfix forms makes side effects more apparent.\n\nPrefix `++` and prefix `--` are sugar for `+= 1` and `-= 1`, but promote unnecessarily tricky code (such as initializing a loop variable to `-1` rather than `0`).

The internal function has a slightly different signature. The new internal function is half the size of the old `curryN` and completely avoids using `_slice`.\n\nI've also used `for` loops just to provocate. I think the idea of always using `while` loops is silly. It's like always using `reduce` and forbidding `map`. And the kind of \"consistency\" that is achieved by doing so is just as harmful. Code becomes less expressive and harder to read and understand because you're using a more general construct when a more specific one would capture the desired control flow better. \n\nHere is the new `_curryN` written with while loops:\n\n``` javascript\nmodule.exports = function _curryN(length, recieved, fn) {\n  return function() {\n    var combined = [];\n    var combinedIdx = -1; // What! Minus one?

    "body": "This PR makes `R.evolve` recurse into nested objects if one is present in both the object to evolve and the object of transformation functions.\n\nShort example:\n\n``` javascript\nR.evolve({nested: {object: R.add(1)}}, {nested: {object: 1}}); //=> {nested: {object: 2}}\n```\n\nThis PR also changes the behavior of `R.evolve` when a transformation function exists for a property that does not exist on the object to evolve. Currently the transformation function is invoked with `undefined` and a new key is created on the returned object. New behavior is simply to not invoke the transformation function. I've decided to do that for the following reasons:\n1. `evolve` is a function for modifying properties. To me it seems unexpected that it in some cases will also add new properties. I.e. not only modify existing properties but also change the shape of the object.\n2. Passing `undefined` to a function otherwise used to update an existing property will rarely result in something desirable. Most often it will give broken data or runtime errors.\n   `R.evolve({amount: R.add(1)}, {}); //=> {amount: NaN}`\n   `R.evolve({name: R.toUpper}, {}); //=> Throws \"TypeError: n is undefined\"`\n   The transformation function would pretty much have to special case on `undefined`.\n3. It makes `evolve` much more useful when dealing with objects of different shapes. I can do stuff like `R.map(R.evolve({name: R.toUpper}), list)` even if some items in `list` does not have a `name` property.\n4. Ramda has other functions if one wants to add new properties to an object (`R.set` can be used for things like supplying defaults).\n5. As an added benefit it makes the implementation simpler and more efficient since we'll only have to loop over the object to transform and not over the object of functions.\n\nThis is a breaking change. But I'd say it's a very low risk one. The old behavior was undocumented and quite odd. I doubt that many people depends on it. This PR documents the new behavior both in the description of `evolve` and in the provided example. The recursiveness is of course documented as well.\n",

    "body": "This pull request adds a function that recursively combines two supplied objects into one. This has previously been discussed at #1073. This PR uses the name `set` as a non-final placeholder.\n\nThis implementation follows the rules I outlined in the above mentioned thread with a few changes based on the discussion. These rules leads to a very simple implementation and behavior that is IMO easy to understand:\n\n1/ The function recurses into ~~arrays and~~ non-atomic objects. Non-atomic objects are objects that have keys in the eyes of `Object.keys` (i.e. they have own enumerable properties). It will for instance recurse into an object literal but not into a date object.\n2/ Values from objects are always copied into a new plain object.\n3/ ~~Value from arrays are copied into a new array. Sparse arrays are not handled.~~ Arrays are always copied by reference.\n\n**Use cases**\n\nAs I've [mentioned](https://gitter.im/ramda/ramda?at=555229f11817239c37e4e6c4) I think the most interesting way to think about such a function is as [a way to set properties](https://gitter.im/ramda/ramda?at=5552359df853e7f14c2b84c5) on objects.\n\nThis way of thinking has changed my opinions on the implementation in two ways:\n1. The overriding object should be first instead of last to be consistent with `assoc` and `assocPath`. `R.assoc('c', 3, {a: 1, b: 2})` matches `R.set({c: 3}, {a: 1, b: 2})`.\n2. I now think of the returned object as \"`b` with these changes from `a`\" instead of \"a brand new thing made up of `a` and `b`.\" With the first view I'd expect as little deep copying as possible but with the second view I'd expect everything to be deep copied. This PR implements the former.\n\nI see this function as a more powerful and useful version of `assoc` and `deepAssoc`.\n\n``` javascript\n// Compare this\nvar o = {a: {b: 1, c: 2, d: 3}};\nvar o2 = R.set({a: {b: 4, c: 5}}, 0);\n// To this\nvar o3 = R.compose(\n  R.assocPath(['a', 'b'], 4)\n  R.assocPath(['a', 'c'], 5)\n)(o);\n```\n\nI think this is a very welcome addition to Ramda. Currently Ramda has a lot of great functions for working with arrays without mutating them but it feels a bit weaker with regards to objects.\n\n**About arrays**\n\n@ivan-kleshnin had some [great reasons](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/1073#issuecomment-100600208) why we should not (unlike Lodash) attempt to merge arrays.\n\nWhile being able to do something like this is neat:\n\n``` javascript\nvar users = {\n  'data': [{ 'user': 'barney' }, { 'user': 'fred' }]\n};\nvar ages = {\n  'data': [{ 'age': 36 }, { 'age': 40 }]\n};\n_.merge(users, ages);\n// → { 'data': [{ 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36 }, { 'user': 'fred', 'age': 40 }] }\n```\n\nBut the same behavior can also be a disaster:\n\n``` javascript\nvar users = {\n  'data': [{ 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36 }, { 'user': 'fred', 'age': 40 }]\n};\nvar anotherUser = {\n  'data': [{ 'user': 'kim', 'age': 42 }] // new user, not an update\n};\n_.merge(users, anotherUser);\n// → { 'data': [{ 'user': 'kim', 'age': 42 }, { 'user': 'fred', 'age': 40 }] }\n// Barney disappeared :(\n```\n\n**About naming**\n\nI really don't know what to call this thing. In my head the name `merge` implies merging two conceptually equal objects. Not applying a few changes to an existing object. On the other hand @joneshf seemed to have been thinking about `merge` like this all along. I really don't know.\n\nBut I definitely think that having both this function _and_ `merge` would be too much. I choose `set` as the name in this PR just because I had to call it something (and `set` might not be a bad name).\n\n**Symmetry with `R.evolve`**\n\nWhen/if this gets merged I think `R.evolve` should be made recursive in the same way as well. I think these two functions together provides a very solid experience for updating object without mutations.\n\nHandling the before mentioned Lodash example is very easy and, importantly, free from bad surprises (the example below can be implemented with todays `evolve` and `merge` but this power does not extend to nested objects).\n\n``` javascript\nvar users = {\n  'data': [{ 'user': 'barney' }, { 'user': 'fred' }]\n};\nvar ages = {\n  'data': [{ 'age': 36 }, { 'age': 40 }]\n};\nR.evolve({data: R.zipWith(R.set, ages.data)}, users);\n// { 'data': [{ 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36 }, { 'user': 'fred', 'age': 40 }] }\n\nvar anotherUser = {\n  'data': [{ 'user': 'kim', 'age': 42 }] // new user, not an update\n};\nR.evolve({data: R.concat(anotherUser.data)}, users);\n// { 'data': [{ 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36 }, { 'user': 'fred', 'age': 40 }, { 'user': 'kim', 'age': 42 }] }\n// Barney did not disappear :)\n```\n\n**Cycles**\n\nThis implementation does not detect cycles. I agrees with @ivan-kleshnin's [opinion on this](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/1073#issuecomment-100601526). Also as far as I can think the only way to create data with cycles it with mutations (I could be wrong)? So not supporting them should be a minor issue. If there was a very simple way to detect cycles that would not be too inefficient I think adding it would be great though. But I can't think of one.\n\nConsider this PR to be nothing but my current suggestion for an implementation. Everything is up for discussion :)\n",

This seems to be in line with the existing transducer compatible functions.\n- The non-transducer implementation is meant to be performant and I've used `Array#push`. There is however no other Ramda function that uses push. Is there a reason for that? It is a fast way to build an array and it is supported by all browsers.\n- The non-`With` version is simply based on the `With`-version. I couldn't find any other functions implemented on top of their `With` companion in this way but it seems logical so I did it anyway.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",

They support predicates taking a variable amount of arguments.\n\nThere is a test case where the predicates are all of different arity? I don't see this making sense since all the predicates are passed the same arguments.\n\nI can't think of any use case where a list of predicates would all take more than one argument, all be of the same arity and all make sense to the same set of arguments?\n\nFurthermore `allPass` and `anyPass` are variadic. So even though their arity is 1 I can do stuff like this: `R.allPass([gt10, even], 11);`. As far as I can see this is undocumented.\n\nThis commit does the following: Change `allPass` and `anyPass` into functions taking two arguments that behaves exactly like `allPass` and `anyPass` does today when the predicates takes one argument. But, they don't support anything else.\n\nThis has the advantage that support for `R.allPass([gt10, even], 11)` can be supported without relying on variadic behavior. The implementation is also vastly simplified.\n\nI realize that I should have opened an issue before creating this pull request in case there actually is a realistic use case for the removed functionality.\n",

Though we're providing three things, we're providing _four_ arguments to `R.invoke`. The expression would be clearer if the arguments we wish to provide to `'Ramda'.substring` were grouped:\n\n``` javascript\nR.invoke('substring', 'Ramda', [1, 4])\n```\n\nThis would make the function easier to describe:\n\n<p><del>Returns the result of invoking <code>obj[methodName]</code> with the zero or more positional arguments following <code>methodName</code> and <code>obj</code>.</del></p>\n\n\n<p><ins>Returns the result of applying <code>obj[methodName]</code> to <code>args</code>.</ins></p>\n\n\nIt would also simplify the function's `@sig`. Perhaps most significantly, it would mean we could partially apply any combination of arguments.

It also tracks the source function and name of a function.\n\nAn obvious extension of this is to do native unwrapping (for example doing currying and partial and other decorators in a single method as lodash does [big benefit!])\n\nThe main motivation of this is (for me) is a) a big perf benefit by avoiding arity and b) enables us to later implement `restParams` which will be a substantial improvement in several places in the code base (it didn't make sense to implement this through arity). Overall this enables a couple follow up optimizations\n\nPoints of interest:\n- Should it be added to an object publicly   or use a symbol\n- What should be included\n- Should repl stuff be added\n\nBenchmarks to follow (in case its not obvious the benefit): http://jsperf.com/ramda-currying-cost/4\n",

    "body": "Well, I'll start very briefly with some good bits:\n- Everyone gets to write the same awesome Ramda code they've always been writing, only difference is now behind the scenes you'll find transducers for some operations.\n- We can get rid of `mapObj`, `mapObjIndexed` (all transducer callbacks will get `value`, `key` and `collection`), `filterIndexed`, etc.\n- It is very easy to add support for anything that follows the iterator protocol (Immutable.js already supported, need to have a discussion about how to generalize), streams, etc. (#695, #860, etc)\n- Transducer speed scales very well to large data structures.\n\nThe bad (one of the? the worst?) part: the code I think is quite difficult to follow. I _really_ wanted to find a way to properly visualize the code paths before submitting this PR, but I haven't come up with a great solution. However, I believe things are more or less working so that the core contributors can get an idea of what is going on, decide if you'd like to move in this direction, another direction with transducers, or somewhere else.\n\nYou can see some basic usage in `test/transduce.js`. I have simply been running\n\n`make && ./node_modules/.bin/mocha test/transduce.js`\n\nduring development. I've also included in `dist/` some examples that follow a couple different code paths (obviouly these would be deleted if any of this is ever merged). I've added a `debugger;` line so if you open up the html examples in a browser and have your console open it should break before it starts doing anything important and you can step through to get a better idea of what's happening. I've started building some UML-ish diagrams as well which I think will be pretty nice when they are done, but not sure when that will be.\n### Some notes in no particular order\n\nAs http://clojure.org/transducers tells us,\n\n> Composition of the transformer runs right-to-left but builds a transformation stack that runs left-to-right\n\nNow, if you've got pipes and compositions and some of their constituent functions are transducers and some are not, things could get really weird really fast. So all transducers in a **composition** are **piped** left-to-right so that they run right-to-left as you would expect in a composition (actually I've only implemented pipe as that is what I used in my work, we can just deprecate `compose`, right? Jokes! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:  I just did not take the time to implement `compose` as it is simply the mirror of pipe). Let's look at a quick example here. Say you build a pipe\n\n`pipe(a, b, c, d, e, f)`\n\nwhere a-f are functions. If b, c and d are transducers, they will be composed when the pipe is built, so that when the pipe is actually run you still get a -> (b -> c -> d transducer stack) -> e -> f.\n\nI haven't used this PR to re-implement everything that might possibly be a transducer yet, just \n- `map` and `filter` cause everyone loves mapping and filtering\n- `take` to test terminating transduction\n- `partitionBy` and `mapcat` because we use those in our implementation\n\nNeed to implement curry anywhere since we are \"manually\" currying.\n\nThis also causes problems with `checkForMethod` as currently used (`filter` tests for this and fails), I've just removed that call while the PR is under review.\n\nI took out stream stuff as the default output collection (a write stream?) deserves some discussion.\n\nThere are some nice helper functions that are easy to implement like `into` (convert anything to anything else), `toList` (convert anything to a list), `toMap` (you get the idea) which I've not included.\n\nAlright, it's getting late, I'm sure I'm forgetting plenty and regardless there are more todos and questions, but I figured it's best to just get this up and let you guys take the lead from here.\n",

Besides testing and other coverage, documenting your code is often neglected although it is a very engaging part of Open Source.\n\nSo far over 500 **Ruby** projects are sporting these badges to raise awareness for the importance of inline-docs and to show potential contributors that they can expect a certain level of code documentation when they dive into your project's code and motivate them to eventually document their own. I would really like to do the same for the **JavaScript** community and roll out support for JS over the coming weeks (early adopters are [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever), [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [when](https://github.com/cujojs/when)).\n\nAlthough this is \"only\" a passion project, I really would like to hear your thoughts, critique and suggestions.

For consistency, though, they should. One could then say that `R.curry(f)(R.__, b)(a)` is equivalent to `f(a, b)` for any binary function `f`, in the same way one can currently say that `R.curry(f)(a)(b)` is equivalent to `f(a, b)` for any binary function `f`. (All the discussion in Fantasy Land seems to have got me thinking in terms of laws and whatnot.)\n\n✝✝ Currently `R.divide(R.__)` is equivalent to `R.flip(R.divide)`, which has always seemed to me like too much magic. I doubt anyone is using this form, as the `R.flip` version is much clearer.\n",

Easy to get around by using file names. And actually as I'm writing this comment it occurred to me `scripts/build` must do something similar and I see\n\n```\nvar filenameToIdentifier =\n    R.pipe(R.split('/'),\n           R.last,\n           R.split('.'),\n           R.head);\n```\n\n. My version was\n\n`path.match(/(\\w+)\\.js$/)[1]`\n\nha! I still have a long way to go to get used to this functional stuff :) I was thinking it might make sense to add the function name to all the `@func` tags we have, but if the build script uses the filenames maybe this is not necessary. Also should we add `scripts/common` or what have you for shared functionality like this?\n",

Here are my reasons:\n- `foldl` and `foldr` are well liked. Several people have these in their shortlists of aliases to keep.\n- `foldl` and `foldr` are more consistent with our ad hoc naming scheme. We have `lPartial` and `rPartial`, for example, rather than `partial` and `partialRight`.\n- We have a function named `unfoldr`. It's inconsistent to have `reduceRight` and `unfoldr`, and `unreduceRight` doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.\n\nI'd love to merge this change and rebase #618 on top of it.

Today I decided the placeholder name, `unapply`, is in fact the right name, given the `f`/`unapply(apply(f))` equivalence.\n\nThis function _could_ be used to define the identity functions discussed in #511:\n\n``` javascript\nvar identity1 = R.compose(R.nth(1), R.unapply(R.identity));\nvar identity2 = R.compose(R.nth(2), R.unapply(R.identity));\n\nidentity1('a', 'b', 'c');  // => 'b'\nidentity2('a', 'b', 'c');  // => 'c'\n```\n\n`R.unapply` is useful for the same reason these identity functions are useful: one can reference specific elements of the arguments object, facilitating composition. `R.unapply` is more general, though, so I'm confident other uses will emerge. Even having a function for creating arrays is useful at times:\n\n``` javascript\nR.unapply(R.identity)(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);  // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n",

This is somewhat neat but probably doesn't matter in practice.\n- This implementation doesn't support currying like this: `R.invokerN(2)('slice', 6, 8)`. I.e. the first two parameters needs to be supplied. The reason being that the old `invokerN` didn't support it either and that I think partially applying with only an arity isn't something one would want to do/should do. This `invokerN` is already better at currying. However, if others disagree I am open adding it in.\n\nCritique of the implementation etc. is welcome :) This is obviously a breaking change but besides that everything should be fine (all tests pass).\n",

    "body": "There was some discussion of automating the release process in #339. This pull request is my proposed solution.\n\nThis pull request adds three release targets to the makefile. If merged, publishing a new release will involve nothing more than running `make release-$LEVEL`.\n\nBelow is a walkthrough of what happens when one runs `make release-minor` (to choose a concrete example). I'll keep this up to date as the pull request matures in response to feedback.\n1.  `$(XYZ) --increment $(@:release-%=%)` is expanded to:\n   \n   ``` shell\n   node_modules/.bin/xyz --repo git@github.com:ramda/ramda.git --script scripts/prepublish --increment minor\n   ```\n2.  The above command is run.\n3.  xyz checks that the current branch is `master`. If it is not, xyz will exit with an exit status of 1 after printing the following message to stderr:\n   \n   ```\n   Current branch does not match specified --branch\n   ```\n4.  xyz checks that the working directory contains no unstaged changes. If this is not the case, xyz will exit with an exit status of 1 after printing the following message to stderr:\n   \n   ```\n   Working directory contains unstaged changes\n   ```\n5.  xyz reads `name` and `version` from **package.json** and assigns these values to variables.\n6.  xyz uses the [semver](https://www.npmjs.org/package/semver) executable to determine the new version string by running:\n   \n   ``` shell\n   \"$dir/node_modules/.bin/semver\" -i \"$increment\" \"$version\"\n   ```\n7.  xyz presents a confirmation prompt:\n   \n   ```\n   Current version is 0.6.0. Press [enter] to publish ramda@0.7.0.▌\n   ```\n   \n   This provides on opportunity to abort by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.\n8.  xyz runs the prepublish script with appropriate environment variables:\n   \n   ``` shell\n   VERSION=0.7.0 PREVIOUS_VERSION=0.6.0 'scripts/prepublish'\n   ```\n9.  The prepublish script updates Ramda version strings in **README.md**:\n   \n   ``` bash\n   README=\"$(cat README.md)\"\n   README=\"${README//\"$PREVIOUS_VERSION/ramda.min.js\"/\"$VERSION/ramda.min.js\"}\"\n   README=\"${README//\"${PREVIOUS_VERSION%.*}/ramda.min.js\"/\"${VERSION%.*}/ramda.min.js\"}\"\n   echo \"$README\" >README.md\n   ```\n10. The prepublish script adds **README.md** to the index:\n    \n    ``` bash\n    git add README.md\n    ```\n11. The prepublish script updates Ramda version strings in **ramda.js**:\n    \n    ``` bash\n    RAMDA=\"$(cat ramda.js)\"\n    RAMDA=\"${RAMDA//$PREVIOUS_VERSION/$VERSION}\"\n    echo \"$RAMDA\" >ramda.js\n    ```\n12. The prepublish script adds **ramda.js** to the index:\n    \n    ``` bash\n    git add ramda.js\n    ```\n13. The prepublish script runs `make ramda.min.js`.\n14. Make expands the body of the target to:\n    \n    ``` shell\n    node_modules/.bin/uglifyjs --compress --mangle --preamble '/*! ramda 2014-10-19 */' <'ramda.js' >'ramda.min.js'\n    ```\n    \n    The current date will appear in place of `2014-10-19`.\n15. The prepublish script adds **ramda.min.js** to the index.\n16. xyz updates `version` in **package.json** and **bower.json**, and adds these files to the index.\n17. xyz runs `git commit --message 'Version 0.7.0'`.\n18. xyz runs `git tag --annotate 'v0.7.0' --message 'Version 0.7.0'`.\n19. xyz runs `git push 'git@github.com:ramda/ramda.git' 'refs/heads/master' 'refs/tags/v0.7.0'`.\n20. xyz runs `npm publish`. **.npmignore** ensures that only the following files are included in the tarball:\n    \n    ```\n    - package/package.json\n    - package/README.md\n    - package/ramda.js\n    - package/ramda.min.js\n    - package/LICENSE.txt\n    - package/ext/debug/debug.js\n    - package/ext/impure/setProp.js\n    - package/ext/lazylist/lazylist.js\n    - package/ext/random/random.js\n    - package/ext/types/Either.js\n    - package/ext/types/Future.js\n    - package/ext/types/IO.js\n    - package/ext/types/Identity.js\n    - package/ext/types/Maybe.js\n    - package/ext/types/Reader.js\n    ```\n\n---\n### What this release process does _not_ do\n\nThis does not create nifty GitHub release thingamajigs (à la [ramda/ramda/releases](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/releases)). Instead, it creates run-of-the-mill releases (à la [davidchambers/xyz/releases](https://github.com/davidchambers/xyz/releases)). I don't know whether the fancy release notes are a GitHub-specific feature or whether GitHub is exposing Git functionality. I suspect the former, but I'll read about the feature to find out.\n\n**Update:** Having read about GitHub releases (the [blog post](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software), the [help article](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), and the [API documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/)) it's still not clear to me exactly how they work. I've learnt enough to be fairly sure that creating a GitHub release as part of the automated release process would prove more trouble than it's worth. I do find the release notes helpful when bumping my Ramda dependency, but the compare view (e.g. https://github.com/ramda/ramda/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0) is a decent alternative.\n",

If it is not accepted, totally cool, hopefully its existence still somehow furthers the ramda cause even in defeat\n- I saw 0.6 was about ready to go, I doubt this would go in there, but I figured I better submit the PR before I found myself writing a `curry0` function (more on that in a bit)\n- got rid of `op`\n- It doesn't seem to be Ramda style to include inline comments. I have some in there (with at least one typo that I now see) but we can obviously get rid of those\n- I had to update `checkForMethod` to return a function with the proper arity\n- `curry2` is updated, and now `curry1` is a thing! Despite being a bit ugly, my totally unscientific testing showed it is (unfortunately) something like 5-10% faster. I did not rewrite `curry3`\n- `R.__` is defined as an object that we can test for with ===, as defining it as `undefined` or `void 0` can cause problems if someone actually wants to use `undefined` and ramda mistakes it for our placeholder.\n- In this implementation, I would say `R.__` is maybe not so much a \"placeholder\" as a \"skip\" concept. Passing in one or more `R.__` with no actual arguments just gives you back the function you already had.\n\nAlright, probably could go on but I think that is a enough to get the discussion started.

I changed the runExample function so that it creates a new function for each test with a name that includes\n- the function it is trying to run the test for\n- the line number from ramda.js\n\nThis way if it fails to compile the test, you will see in your stack trace something like `at Function.runExample.(anonymous function) [as runExample_R_useWith_543]` so it is easy to track down where things are going wrong.\n\nIf it is an actual assertion that fails, you will see the expression that was calculated, what it resulted in, and what the author thought it should have been.\n\nQuick note, I think it is a good idea to use the `R.` version of the function in examples rather than any local function name, as the examples are used to generate the docs at ramdajs.com and it can be strange to see an example not actually use the function it is demonstrating (and of course compliation will fail if there is not actually a local function with that name).\n",

There was really no hope I could write anything properly functional in a couple days so I just got what I had written to pass the lint checker and here it is.\n\nBasic idea:\n- parse the function comments (and function declarations for mocha it() descriptions)\n- extract example, parse example so we can test the //=> 'eg' as assertions\n- inject our executable example source as a function in ramda (so that we can also run internal function examples)\n- run our example function, see what happens\n\nIf you want to see all the assertions being run, you can just add `console.log(msg);` to `assertPairEqual` (maybe grunt option for more verbose?)\n",

Seems really neat!\n\nI noticed an error or two in the examples, one thing lead to another, and I ended up writing a mocha test to compile and run all the examples. I went through and tried to get them all in working order. I changed some around slightly but mostly just little syntax fixes.\n\nThis commit only includes my fixes to the examples. If you would like me to add the mocha test that compiles and runs the examples as well, let me know and I will issue a separate pull request. Thanks!\n",

Converting the object to an array before passing it to `foldl`-like functions is both verbose and has some significant disadvantages. Currently, most Ramda functions only work on arrays, but I'd like to change that, starting with `fold`-family functions.\n\nI see this as more of a conversation starter than anything, since work to be done here before this PR is ready. I'm not satisfied with the current implementation of this for a few reasons:\n- Currently, because `foldl` is decorated by `checkForMethod`, this wastefully checks whether or not the target is an array twice--once in the `checkForMethod` call, and again in the body of the function when checking which function to dispatch. I can conceive of a few ways to get around this, but not without fairly significant refactoring (e.g. I think the `checkForMethod` decoration pattern is a little inflexible as is; I'd pull the check back into each function body, and maybe refactor the dispatching code into a separate function `dispatchMethod`).\n- I'd want to amend this PR before merge to include a patch to all fold-like functions (`foldl.idx`,  `foldr`, etc.) to keep the assorted interfaces consistent.\n\nA broader topic of conversation is to extend this kind of polymorphic functionality to functions other than `foldl` (e.g. `map` `any`, etc.)--many list-oriented functions are useful whether the input list is an array or an object.\n",

My current thinking is to finish this style documentation across all of Ramda's functions, with the ultimate goal of producing a more comprehensive set of docs.\n\nThose docs could potentially resemble something like [Lodash's documentation](http://lodash.com/docs), but I'm not attached to any visual representation in particular.\n\nI've only finished (read: drafted) JSDoc-style documentation for a subset of the library (starting at line 708 in this PR), but I'm curious if this is in line with what y'all had in mind for the project's documentation.
