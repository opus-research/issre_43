      "The way this is supposed to work is as follows:\r\n\r\n* The `PistonBaseBlock::moveBlocks` method is made accessible to the Force Lens code, such that it is always called with that boolean parameter (`extending`) being true.\r\n* The copy of the `moveBlocks` code previously used by the Force Lens and Force Relay did not contain three `if` statements present in `moveBlocks`. The first of those expects the `extending` parameter to be false (and thus is skipped automatically), the other two expect it to be true. To skip those, the value of the `extending` parameter is changed to false just before the first of those `if` statements, if the method is being called in the context of a force lens/relay push. This should be safe to do, as all relevant vanilla uses of the parameter happen before that point. The same is true for its uses in the modifications applied both by Quark and Carpet mod.\r\n\r\nSituations I can think of where this might break things:\r\n* A mod completely replaces the `moveBlocks` method. – Both Carpet and Quark are able to apply extensive changes to piston logic without doing that, so I'd argue that hypothetical other mod is probably Doing It Wrong. This change's modifications to the method code would fail, but I think the method call should still be possible, probably leaving behind a random non-sticky piston head I'd expect to break when it gets updated.\r\n* A mod uses a mix-in with lower priority to access the value of the `extending` parameter in a place before the second code fragment this change intends to disable. – Depending on the nature of the modifications this could cause blocks to move the wrong way, and either they end up at the correct location (just moving in from the opposite direction) or actually move the wrong way altogether.\r\n* A mod uses a mix-in to access the value of the `extending` parameter after this logic changed it. – The mod's access would be off by one access location, which could break that mod's intended functionality. Best case here would be if it attempted to do a similar thing, which could still be compatible which what this change is trying to do.\r\n\r\nMaybe a better way instead of modifying the actual value of `extending` would be to replace the access to its value with the expression used to set its new value now. Then again, that also has a chance of failing in a different way if another mod inserts additional code using that parameter. Those two `if` statements being skipped are responsible for creating the extending piston head block and giving adjacent blocks a shape update notification.",

      "Sorry for dragging on this. I took a closer look and I think there's a better solution hiding that isn't adding yet-another-special-case for the force relay. On the other hand, things are tricky.\r\n\r\nBasically, whenever a warp lens warps, it adds the destination position to the burst's \"have I collided here already\" set. \r\n\r\nHowever, the problem is that checking this flag is up to each individual lens, as it's an open question whether you want a composite effect to activate immediately on the warp destination (if there's something there) or not. Explosion? maybe not. Block breaking or weight lensing, maybe? Let's not get into whether a blanket check on this flag is appropriate or not, and just assume we'll just add the check to the entropic lens.\r\n\r\nSo adding a `!burst.hasCollidedAtPos(hitResult.getBlockPos())` check should work right? No, because the `HitResult` still has the position of the old collision, and that position has not been added to the set yet (this is the right thing to do, we don't want to add it until the entire collision process is complete).\r\n\r\nSo we need some way for warp lenses to \"reroute\" the `HitResult` of the collision to point to the new position. This is tricky, because `collideBurst` can only return one thing, and `HitResults` are immutable. It would require enriching the result of `collideBurst` to more than just a plain `shouldKill` boolean.\r\n\r\nOverall lenses are the most shaky part of Botania's core and changes to it are really tricky to get right.",
      "Yeah, i agree, lenses are super shaky. There's still also that issue of the warp lens being invisible after warping that i still quite haven't pinned down. \r\n\r\nThe shouldKill is also just in general confusing to work with, i think. Revisiting the whole thing would probably be nice but it's probably too late to get that in for 1.19.\r\n\r\nWith that said, i'm not sure what to do with this PR. merge for now and clean up lenses later? I'll leave the decision up to you willie. ",
      "The disappeared-after-warp thing, assuming it's a desync as you conjectured, can be sidestepped entirely by only killing the burst on the server (I have a patch up for that). With that patch, bursts seem to be visible after warping just fine.\r\n\r\n@LeoBeliik I think for now, just add a TODO to the entropic file where you made the fix pointing back to my big comment above, and I'll revisit it later.",

Possibly ever.\r\n\r\nHowever! Automation can insert full stacks of 64 items into each of the six slots of the tiny potato inventory, but a player right clicking can only add one item per slot. I found this really confusing because if you hopped items into a Tiny Potato it looked like they were disappearing.\r\n\r\nSo the first commit only allows tiny potatoes to hold 1 item per slot. This makes Tiny Potatoes much less effective as a mass storage solution, and I predict it will drastically upset the Tiny Potato meta. But it brings their automation-side interface closer to what people would expect it to be, based on how it feels to interact with the block.\r\n\r\n### Buff tiny potatoes\r\n\r\nOk, so now comparators can read the fill-level of the tiny potato inventory.

This causes the game to crash on startup because Botania uses it [right here](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Botania/blob/1.18.x/Fabric/src/main/java/vazkii/botania/fabric/FabricBotaniaCreativeTab.java#L31-L34) when creating its creative tab.\r\n\r\nQuilt's implementation [does include a reimplementation of `FabricItemGroupBuilder`](https://github.com/QuiltMC/fabric-api-qsl/blob/1.18.2/fabric-item-groups-v0/src/main/java/net/fabricmc/fabric/api/client/itemgroup/FabricItemGroupBuilder.java). Unfortunately FabricItemGroupBuilder is a too-opinionated half-baked API, it only accepts a ResourceLocation for the creative tab name instead of a simple String, concatenating the halves of the ResourceLocation with a period.\r\n\r\nIt's literally not possible to create a creative tab that doesn't have a period in the translation key with this API, so I went ahead and changed the translation key on Forge to match. Sigh. The second commit in this PR renames the language keys in non-`en_us` locales; I also took the opportunity to remove the language entry if it was the same as `en_us`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nCreating a creative tab without using *any* loader-provided APIs would basically require pasting the ItemGroupExtensions mixin into the Botania source tree, which sounds like a fun source of bugs later on down the line.",

Add recipes for livingwood log -> livingwood, etc.\r\n- [x] I believe the Pure Daisy recipe for Livingwood uses `#minecraft:logs`. That would create a loop where livingwood log would become itself. Possible solutions:\r\n  - Add an ignore-list of sorts to the Pure Daisy recipes, so that it can ignore `#botania:livingwood_logs` and maybe `#botania:dreamwood_logs`.\r\n  - Add a check in the Pure Daisy to make it not transform blocks into themselves. This would make it possible to \"purify\" livingwood, stripped livingwood/logs and glimmering stripped/regular livingwood/logs back into livingwood logs. (I like this one best from a player standpoint.)\r\n  - Or just do the first option but only ignore `botania:livingwood_log`. More versatile for datapacks, but functionally the same as the second option.\r\n- [x] Make the Pure Daisy retain all blockstates from the input block that apply to the output block. This would make logs retain their rotation when they're turned to livingwood logs.\r\n- [x] Currently (as far as i'm aware), only `botania:dreamwood` stops the flight of minecarts coming from spectral rails, but not the stairs, slabs, walls, planks, etc. There should probably be a tag that controls what stops it, if there isn't already. Should at least contain `#botania:dreamwood_logs`, i'm not sure about stairs/slabs/walls/planks etc.\r\n  - Currently only stopping on `#botania:dreamwood_logs` (which includes `#botania:glimmering_dreamwood_logs`).\r\n- [x] As discussed in discord, instead of the elven portal requiring `botania:livingwood` and `botania:glimmering_livingwood`, it should just need `#botania:livingwood_logs` and `#botania:glimmering_livingwood_logs`. That way you could make the portal out of stripped livingwood if you wanted, or even make the whole portal glimmering. ~~Maybe add a stripped elven gateway core (and making `#botania:elven_gateway_cores`?) to match. Should probably then be added to the JEI/REI elven trade category.~~\r\n- [x] ~~Because of how the blockstate multipart system works and is used for walls, to avoid z-fighting on dreamwood and stripped dreamwood walls, we will have to:~~ Nevermind, blockstate picks are consistent for a given block coordinate, so all the active multiparts will have the same index of model, meaning there will be no z-fighting.\r\n  - ~~Create a new `dreamwood_template_wall_side.json`, `dreamwood_template_wall_post.json` and `dreamwood_template_wall_side_tall.json`, which are like `template_wall_side.json` etc. except it allows specifying a different texture to be used for the top and bottom faces than the rest of the faces.~~\r\n  - ~~Use those templates in the models 1-6 for stripped and normal dreamwood walls, specifying the same texture every time for the tops/bottoms, using the textures 1-6 for the rest of the faces~~\r\n- [x] The blockstates for all the slabs and stairs and walls etc should have `\"uvlock\": true`\r\n- [x] Maybe rename Framed Livingwood etc. to Framed Livingwood Planks and add them to `#minecraft:planks`\r\n- [x] Add livingwood, dreamwood and shimmerwood planks + stairs and slabs to the respective `#minecraft:planks/wooden_stairs/wooden_slabs` tags (i guess this was just missed when moving to 1.14+, but makes sense to include here).\r\n- [x] Look through lexica botania to see if any changes are necessary.",

This PR essentially locks the option to \"on\".\r\n* Direct caching of tile entities has been removed from TileEntityGeneratingFlower and TileEntityFunctionalFlower, and a call to getTileEntity is made to look up the binding each time it's used instead. This makes the `xxxCoordinates` fields the authoritative source for the flower's binding. This is - technically - worse for performance, but I think it makes better code.\r\n* I also added something similar to PR #3789 since this PR changes the flower logic so much that that PR isn't mergable anymore.\r\n* The Endoflame consumes fuel when not bound to a spreader now.

That lead to the resulting binding range being shifted.\r\n\r\nCalling\r\nBlockPos#distanceSq(x, y, z, boolean center)\r\ninstead, allows to specify whether the coordinates should be centered or not.\r\n\r\nAdding 0.5 to the range before squaring makes the resulting binding range a nice and clean circle, instead of a circle with dots on the flat sides (dunno how to describe it better).",

That is because the value `f1` is the constant expression `0.016666668F * 1.6F`. Substituting that expression into the former results in `0F / (0.016666668F * 1.6F)`, which, according to [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0+%2F+%280.016666668+*+1.6%29) comes to `0`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in this case,\r\n```java\r\nms.translate(0.0F, 0F / f1, 0.0F);\r\n```\r\nis equivalent to\r\n```java\r\nms.translate(0.0F, 0.0F, 0.0F);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the translation is by `(0, 0, 0)`.\r\n\r\n## Translating by `(0, 0, 0)` multiplies by the identity matrix\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot be exactly sure about the implementation of `ms.translate`, a translation of `(x, y, z)` with 4x4 matrices is usually implemented by multiplying with a matrix of the following form:\r\n\r\n|1|0|0|x|\r\n|-|-|-|-|\r\n|0|1|0|y|\r\n|0|0|1|z|\r\n|0|0|0|1|\r\n\r\nIn this case, `x`, `y` and `z` are all `0`, so the matrix looks like this:\r\n\r\n|1|0|0|0|\r\n|-|-|-|-|\r\n|0|1|0|0|\r\n|0|0|1|0|\r\n|0|0|0|1|\r\n\r\nAvid readers may notice that this is an **identity matrix**, that is, multiplying a matrix `m` by it results in `m`, and multiplying it by a matrix `m` results in `m`. In other words, multiplying by an identity matrix results in no transformation at all.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a translation of `(0, 0, 0)`, as in\r\n```java\r\nms.translate(0.0F, 0F / f1, 0.0F);\r\n```\r\nis equivalent to multiplying by an identity matrix, which is equivalent to no transformation at all. Therefore, the line is redundant. □\r\n",

I'm not opposed to turning the item registries into item capabilities, but blocks must remain in this system as to my knowledge it's impossible to attach capabilities to blocks without tile entities.\r\n\r\n**Non-functional interfaces should probably be tags**\r\nPlease advise on this point, it seems like it would be possible to turn ICosmeticBauble into a tag.\r\n\r\n**Explicit empty checks**\r\nPlease advise on this point. Item registries could easily have get overloads added for ItemStacks that check for stack emptyness before querying the hashmap.\r\n\r\n**Code example**\r\nOld code:\r\n```\r\nif (stackItem instanceof IFlowerPlaceable) {\r\n    success = ((IFlowerPlaceable) stackItem).tryPlace(this, ctx);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNew code:\r\n```\r\nIFlowerPlaceable placeable = IFlowerPlaceable.registry().get();\r\nif(placeable != null) {\r\n    success = placeable.tryPlace(this, ctx);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

Should that not be in a separate change though, or do you think it should be bundled in this one?~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: I actually realised what you meant after writing this, I will refactor tomorrow when I get the chance and move that method from TilePool to somewhere in the API.

      "That sounds nice, i will probably do that for the functionality and at least try the texture, but do you think it should just convert dirt into farmland and grass int grass path or should it convert both in farmland when you sneak?\r\nAlso i would still give it the AOE.",

(maybe integrate the hoeing into the active/non-active mode so you can aoe hoe or single hoe aswell)\r\n\r\nEdit: also seeing as it goes with the harvester name and farming functions, maybe throw in an aoe plant harvest on the active mode",

Прошлые переводчики использовали эти слова с заглавной буквы. Мне интересно что думаете вы по этому поводу. @misny\r\n\r\nДобрый день!\r\nСпасибо за исправление моих недоработок, я действительно рад этому. Есть пожелание, проверяйте как будут выглядеть переводы, т.к. я стремился уменьшить количество слов, чтобы вписать текст в строки лексикона Ботании и в рамки всплывающих подсказок. поэтому приличная часть переводов звучит не по-русски :)\r\nС вопросом написания \"Вы\" или \"вы\" всё достаточно неоднозначно. Например, по правилам русского языка нужно писать с маленькой буквы, по правилам современного бизнес-письма, наоборот, принято писать все слова \"вы\" с заглавной буквы, чтобы подчеркнуть значимость слушателя и чтобы прийти к мировым стандартам.\r\nДругими словами, написание с маленькой буквы часто встречается в литературе, а с заглавной - в бизнес-письме. Теперь вывод: во-первых я за сохранение традиций русского языка, во-вторых, когда написано с маленькой буквы, читать легче, т.е. проще увидеть акцент на других словах, которые решил выделить Vazkii. Если есть желание, сделайте, как считаете правильным, ибо истины здесь нет и смысл переводов от этого не измениться.",

    "body": "My mod, [Demagnetize](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/demagnetize), adds a Demagnetizer that disables magnets on items around it, like the Solegnolia. \r\nWhen I released the mod originally, I added support for Botania by [hackily](https://github.com/comp500/Demagnetize/blob/master/src/main/java/link/infra/demagnetize/blocks/DemagnetizerSolegnoliaCompat.java) emulating the Solegnolia, however this completely ignores the Whitelist/Blacklist functionality in my mod. Emulation of the Solegnolia also [breaks](https://github.com/comp500/Demagnetize/issues/1) this functionality in other mods' magnets that support the Solegnolia. I intended to submit a PR to Botania to improve this, but never got around to it.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, this PR adds a check for the boolean entity NBT tag `PreventRemoteMovement` in the magnet ring, originally standardised by Immersive Engineering and supported by almost all mods that add magnets. This will prevent the ring from working on items that have this tag. Immersive Engineering currently adds explicit support (through Botania's API) for preventing items on conveyors from being picked up by the ring, but after this is merged it will not be necessary; however it would be a bad idea to remove the compatibility from IE as it will break the functionality in older versions of Botania. A more thorough discussion of the `PreventRemoteMovement` tag and a related tag `AllowMachineRemoteMovement` was had [here](https://github.com/CoFH/Feedback/issues/1243).\r\n\r\nAn additional idea is that the Solegnolia could also add this tag (along with the `AllowMachineRemoteMovement` tag) to items in the area of the Solegnolia. This would significantly improve cross-mod compatibility for the Solegnolia, at the expense of changing the semantics of the Solegnolia. Currently, the Solegnolia prevents the magnet ring from operating when items or the player are in it's area. If the tag is added items will stay \"demagnetized\" forever, unless every item that has been in the area of a Solegnolia is kept track of and the tag is removed when they leave the area.",

Also syncing exoflame data is pointless, so that is removed too.\r\n\r\nThe only difference in behavior is that detecting a placed pylon/furnace isn't instant, but it's not too slow to recheck the area. \r\nIn case of portals, this change (measured manually with logging, because lazy, and also this testing is probably inaccurate because of JVM warmup) seems to divide the usual tick time by 4 (going from ~80μs to ~15μs, tested with 5 pylons), though scanning takes a bit longer (like 140-160μs). \r\nIn case of exoflames, (tested with 10 furnaces), the tick time is about 10μs, and scanning the area takes ~100μs. It scales with the amount of furnaces - 25 raised ticktime to ~30μs, while having 0 of them is too low to properly measure.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* willie mentioned `IWorldEventListener` on discord, would it be worth hooking into?\r\n* tweaking the rescan period?

[Here is a diagram](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/404671932072591380/545045764934729759/unknown.png), the yellow blocks are the ones the GG checks (lowest layer = needs to be soild, other layers = needs to be nonsolid)\r\n* A few code cleanups (add a few section comments, clean up `par1nbtTagCompound` cruft)\r\n* Change the way the GG handles teleportation.\r\n  * Instead of sharing TP code with endermen, it simply randomly picks a point inside the arena to teleport to.\r\n  * Liquids and nearby collision boxes do not faze the guardian anymore.\r\n    * (This fixes the \"carpet exploit\".)\r\n  * Code has been cleaned up re this, and all of the relevant teleportation logic has been moved into one method.\r\n* The GG now breaks nearby blocks:\r\n  * every tick around itself\r\n  * and along the line of which it teleports.\r\n  * It does not break blocks on the floor or in pylon columns, unless they are \"cheaty blocks\".\r\n  * With a new API method, modders can specify blocks that the GG will not break, e.g. if an addon adds special pylons or something to spice up the gg fight.\r\n    * The default ignored blocks are pylons and beacons, of course.\r\n    * Hey williewillus, I didn't forget to bump the API version this time!\r\n* Fix #2824 by not trusting the heightmap for the positions to spawn magic landmines at.\r\n  * It now just always places them at the height of a random player.\r\n\r\nThings to possibly think about:\r\n\r\n* I removed an override of `EntityLivingBase#attemptTeleport` while cleaning up random teleportation code.\r\n  * Vanilla only uses it for endermen TP and chorus fruit TP. Are there any mods that call this method that could cause problems?\r\n  * The worst that would happen is the GG teleports outside the arena and ends the fight prematurely.",

In other words, the NBT tag on the recipe item has to be a subset of the NBT tag on whatever item the player throws in. This makes it ok to not specify *all* the nbt tags *ever* on an item when writing recipes, which is what players would expect anyways.\r\n\r\nHowever, previously this did not work properly with nested tags. An item with a tag like `{out:{in:1,extra:2}}` would match a recipe with a tag like `{}`, but would not match `{out:{in:1}}`. This creates problems when trying to create recipes for items with lots of weirdly structured NBT data (the use case in the original issue is bees lol `oof`)\r\n\r\nI broke this code out into a separate function, too, so I can call it from btweaks next time we both update, and stop duplicating it.",

      "Bees are an odd case. The nested tags include a list tag, and neither the old approach nor the new one will do a subset comparison on two list tags. To rewrite your example: an item with `{out: [\"in\", \"extra\"]}` should match a recipe with `{out: [\"in\"]}`. There's a reason why list tags *shouldn't* be allowed to do a subset (or rather, startswith) match, but I can't quite put it into words right now."

Kind of like the Rafflowsia before it got a similar big buff\r\n  * A single piece of wool is now worth twice as much as a single piece of charcoal in an Endoflame, compared to 1/4 as much. I think this is fair, considering how hard it is to obtain, dye, and dispense wool, compared to running a very easy mana generating tree farm and just mindlessly drizzling the results over a bunch of endoflames\r\n  * Rainbow status: Tasted.\r\n* Gunpowder to flint is now the same price as flint to gunpowder.\r\n  * This makes it possible to run an Entropinnyum off a cobbleworks by conjurationizing gravel, breaking it until you get 5 flint, alchemizing the flint into gunpowder, alchemizing 4 cobble into sand, and crafting them together into TNT.\r\n  * Previously the flint-to-gunpowder recipe was too expensive to get 2 gunpowder back from a TNT explosion.\r\n* Petal apothecaries now allow whatever you want in them.\r\n  * The glitter particles default to grey if none are assigned via implementing `IFlowerComponent`.\r\n  * I replaced the now-obsolete `IFlowerComponent#canFit` with a deprecated default function.\r\n  * ...And added a few `//TODO 1.13`s since jaysus this name doesn't fit at all now.\r\n  * Packmakers love this feature btw :wink: \r\n* Apothecaries and altars can NBT-match their items.\r\n  * Basically the user specified item has to have at least all of the NBT tags that the recipe specified item has.\r\n  * Check `RecipePetals#compareStacks`.\r\n  * Nothing in Botania itself uses this feature right now, but it proved to be pretty popular with packmakers too",

Running particles? Riding entities? Fire damage? DEFINITELY check this out. Lots of stuff that's not really that bad on its own but when you have a bunch of mana bursts doing these pointless checks every tick + spreaders occasionally doing 400 or so in a single tick... it can add up\r\n\r\nFeel free to look in to any of those areas - I'll probably do it myself later when I get the time, but it's like 2:30am",

      "Similiarly to `inWater` you could probably comment out the glowing parts (I tried to manually set a burst to glow and it didn't seem to do anything, I guess because there's nothing to render, just some particles) and `throwableShake` (seems entirely unused for EntityProjectile).\r\n\r\nOverriding things `onEntityUpdate` calls is probably a good idea - make running particles and water movement etc. no-ops and make sure it never can be on fire I guess.\r\n\r\nCan we make the lens stack and the used lens a variable or something instead of reading it from the data manager every single time? That would likely reduce deserialization overhead from reading the stack so many times, and maybe #1977 could finally get closed? \r\n\r\nIs it worth hooking the max simulation tick time into a config option? Obviously the upper limit would not be crazy large and the lower limit should stay around this value, I'm just afraid someone is using a weird setup with something like triple Resistance lenses for some reason and it times out after 400 ticks and we will hear angry complaints.",
      "1. I would recommend against overriding things randomly to noop them unless it produces a real, measurable impact. It's more to maintain and keep track of when porting\r\n2. If I recall correctly, the data manager already stores things in deserialized form internally, so this wouldn't help much\r\n3. Yes, the simulation time should be configurable I think.",
      "Profiling definitely is a good idea and Quat actually wanted to do that before doing more in this area (and I had to remind him of the profiler again).\r\n\r\nAnyways, I did a little bit of profiling with Spark with the latest Botania release. Small testing setup of: 3 mana spreaders with resistance lenses pointing directly into a chain of 7 resistance prisms, with 7 blocks of space before a wall. \r\nFor client thread profiling, held a wand of the forest and did `/sparkclient start --include-line-numbers --timeout 60 --interval 1` while looking at the setup.\r\nFor server thread profiling, set up a few pistons moving blocks just before the wall on a 3 second timer and did `/spark start --include-line-numbers --timeout 360 --interval 1`.\r\n\r\n[Client results](https://sparkprofiler.github.io/#Zn9AiHZL5z), [server results](https://sparkprofiler.github.io/#f9sklj71Yt).\r\nSeems like checking if the burst is in lava, entity search as well as all data manager calls combined are somewhat heavy (seems like data manager might be the heaviest thing when all the calls are added), while PositionProperties has a negligible impact. I'd say no-oping some of these things I mentioned might be a viable option.",
      "Vazkii likes it so we're going to merge it pretty much as-is, hope that's okey:eyes:\r\n\r\nI added a configuration option for the spreader trace time (there's no min or max value on it, I can trust people to be sensible here :stuck_out_tongue: ).\r\n\r\nI also nooped `isInLava` since it's a pretty free fix for a relatively expensive function (according to Hubry's profiling about as bad as the pointless `getEntitiesWithinAABBExcludingEntity` checks, ouch)\r\n\r\n> I would recommend against overriding things randomly to noop them unless it produces a real, measurable impact. It's more to maintain and keep track of when porting\r\n\r\nGood point - I added a comment to the `isInLava` override to hopefully explain why it's there and I'll be more careful about this type of thing ifwhen I revisit optimizing."

      "Доброго времени суток. Про что именно идёт речь? Хотя и без ответа на этот вопрос можно пояснить. Дело в том, что американцы любят писать все слова в названии с большой буквы, за исключением or, the, in, to и т.д. У них свои правила, у других свои, но в каких-то моментах эти правила всё же совпадают. Посмотрите на другие переводы и вики-проекты, чтобы убедиться в этом. А ещё лучше посмотреть на перевод самого майнкрафта. Вы видели в русском языке блоки и предметы, где каждое слово пишется с большой буквы? Я думаю, нет. В русском языке с большой буквы принято писать первое слово предложения и имена собственные, а ещё не стоит забывать о местоимении \"Вы\". Кроме того, иногда бывают исключения, о которых Вы можете почитать в интернете"

    "body": "Resolves #2629. I hope Willie is still interested in adding aspects!\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the following:\r\n* Thaumcraft 6 is now pulled directly from Curseforge. The alternative was dumping the whole TC6 API into the api folder in the repo, because adding aspects requires referencing the ThaumcraftApi class, which references a whole lof of stuff, so good luck with compiling. (Removed the marker interfaces from the api folder while I were at it.)\r\n* Made upgrade recipes move attached Thaumcraft item data properly. While infusion enchantments (and, by extension, warping) are not yet available on armor, that's probably coming at some point, as you can see some starts of armor enchantments in Thaumcraft's internal classes.\r\n* Fixed full mana inkwells pulled from creative menu not working. They were just missing the mana tag and Thaumcraft thought they were empty for that reason.\r\n* Blacklisted flux rifts instead of (removed) aura nodes from Rod of the Shaded Mesa.\r\n* Cleaned up a few TODOs around Thaumcraft integration.\r\n* Finally, assigned Thaumcraft aspects to Botania items!\r\n\r\n### Aspects\r\n\r\nThis was probably the most time consuming task and I am still not fully satisfied with it. I tried to assign aspects to the base items and things that don't get them automatically generated, but in the end I at least added aspects to the default assignment for a lot of stuff.\r\n\r\nI did reference Wire's aspects from Botanical Addons (see the issue linked on top), however since Thaumcraft had some pretty big changes done to the aspect list and other things since TC4 (a lot of aspects no longer exist and items contain a lot more essentia nowadays), I had to do my own thing for a big majority of items. I also use autoassigned aspects a lot more.\r\n\r\nI waited with this PR for Beta 17, as that one fixes items containing NBT ignoring aspects assigned to items with no NBT. Turns out a lot of items, including every single Botania bauble, get at least an empty tag the moment you press Shift while looking at it.\r\n\r\nI only noticed one real issue - white petal powder doesn't have Herba I assigned to it and white petal blocks don't have any aspects. Haven't noticed anything else weird other than that.\r\n\r\nI'm open to feedback about the assigned aspects.\r\nOh, and before someone asks, the twigs have only 8 Herba because I wasn't a fan of how every item made with them had like 30 to 60 Herba. That aspect is way too common anyways.",

The new code here calls ManaItemsEvent to enable mods to pass (or remove) mana-storing items from their own inventories.\n\ngetManaBaubles() gathers mana-storing items from the player's baubles inventory. The reason this function is separate from getManaItems() is because Botania code requires sendBaubleUpdatePacket to be called when a mana-storing bauble is accessed. sendBaubleUpdatePacket needs a slot number as a param, so I had to make this.\n\n**Potential uses:**\nLocations in which mana-storing items can be accessed is no longer fixed to just the base inventory and baubles inventory. This enables a variety of scenarios:\n- Mana-storing items placed in additional inventory or equipment slots added by other mods can now be accessed by Botania items\n- Cyberware items can be used to store mana\n- Mods can selectively disable certain mana-storing items by removing them from the list passed in ManaItemsEvent.

Username will be converted to UUID when the owner has the item in his inventory.\n\nI've tested that this works fine with previous builds of Botania.\n\nI was a bit unsure about what to call the static methods in the ItemRelics file though.

This is by no means a comprehensive revision, and is just the most visible errors I noticed on first reading (at least 236 according to GitHub, or 382 by diffchecker.com).\n\nGithub's diff-checking appears to be overwhelmed by this quantity of edits, so you'll need to use an external tool to actually see the line-by-line changes.\n\nFurther corrections are certainly possible, but the process might stray too far towards \"rewriting\", rather than merely \"cleaning up\". As it stands, I've attempted to preserve the structure and content of the original text as much as possible.\n\nThis should be looked over by the original author before merging, for the following reasons:\n- To ensure that I haven't \"fixed\" anything that wasn't deliberately \"mis-written\" for stylistic effect or to preserve a memetic reference.\n- To pass judgement on a few \"errors\" that I noticed but did not change, for various reasons, listed below.\n- To make sure I haven't \"fixed\" something wrongly. I'm not a professional writer; I have made, can make, and likely will make mistakes of my own.\n\nIssues Not Corrected (but should be looked at):\n- \"Soujourner\" should be \"Sojourner\", but this may be an intentional misspelling.\n- In the Bellethorne entry, the word \"malevelous\" - is that supposed to be \"Marvelous\", \"Malevolent\", or a deliberate portmanteau?\n- \"Simpleton\" is a _noun_, describing a \"simple\" person, with an emphasis on \"person\". The word is (mis?)used in place of the _adjective_ \"Simple\". Stylistic affectation, or error?\n- \"Message from Elven Garde\" and \"Elven Lore\" texts. There were several apparent \"errors\", but Elves may have their own grammatical/syntactic quirks, due to who-knows-how-many-thousands of years of isolation and linguistic drift, followed by an Elvish-to-English translation likely done with no native English speakers at hand. In essence, the \"mistakes\" might be part of the lore.\n",

This pull request adds almost all of Simple Ores2 & akkamaddi's Additions ores to the orechid and orechid ignem lists, with a few exceptions:\n\nI excluded Simple Cobalt's (from akkamaddi's Additions) \"oreCobalt\", to avoid conflicting with and unbalancing anything relying on TiC's cobalt; Simple Cobalt's cobalt is an uncommon overworld ore, vs TiC's cobalt which is a rare nether ore. I excluded Simple Ores Netherrocks' \"oreIllumenite\" because it spawns in glowstone, not netherrack.  Finally, I excluded Simple Cthon's (another akkamaddi Addition) cthon ore, because I have deliberately not ore-dictionaried it to avoid grinder/pulveriser/etc machines from automatically adding ore->dust => smelt to ingot recipes--that would bypass how cthon ore is supposed to be refined in its original mod.  Addresses issue #875.\n\nFinally, your SubTileEntity class file was mis-spelled and would not build. I fixed that.\n",
