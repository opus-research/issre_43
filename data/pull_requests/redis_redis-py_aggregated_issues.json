Now it sets the minimum SSL version. The test is ran with\r\nboth TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 (if supported).\r\n\r\nA new test case is test_tcp_ssl_version_mismatch. The test added for\r\nboth sync and async connections. It uses TLS 1.3 on the client side,\r\nand TLS 1.2 on the server side. It expects a connection error.

The key change involves replacing the initial INFO command check for cluster mode enablement with a direct attempt to execute \"CLUSTER SLOTS\". This method assumes that successful execution of \"CLUSTER SLOTS\" implies cluster mode is active, thus streamlining the initialization process. This optimization aims to reduce startup time without compromising the integrity of cluster checks, making it particularly beneficial for environments where rapid deployment and high performance are critical.\r\n\r\nTo compare an INFO command takes an average of 2 to 3 seconds to complete and REDIS SLOTS takes only a few milliseconds. This enables the timeout being used in the constructor, not being necessary to add a bigger timeout just to initialize the cluster. \r\n\r\nLinked issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis-py/issues/3148\r\n\r\n",

However, PRs made from forks to the upstream public repos will support tokenless (e.g. contributors to OS projects do not need the upstream repo's Codecov token). This <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions\">doc</a> shows instructions on how to add the Codecov token.</li>\n<li>OS platforms have been added, though some may not be automatically detected. To see a list of platforms, see our <a href=\"https://cli.codecov.io\">CLI download page</a></li>\n<li>Various arguments to the Action have been changed.

Now, we check `utils.SSL_AVAILABLE` prior to attempting the import and only raise an error later if (and only if) the application requests an encrypted connection.  This helps support platforms such as `wasm32-wasi` where the `ssl` module is not built by default.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this would be tested in CI using a Python built without `ssl` support.  I'm not sure how feasible that is, though; I'm open to guidance on that aspect.",

This PR attempts to improve on this, by better tracking \"lost\" connections.\r\nSee #2995 for various manifestations of this problem.\r\n\r\n- `ConnectionPool` objects now keep a `WeakSet` of `in_use_connections`.  This allows the garbage collector to find such\r\n  objects if they are not returned to the pool for some reason.\r\n- Connection objects now have a `__del__` method which outputs a `ResourceWarning` in the same way as other IO classes\r\n  in the standard library.  For some reason, the underlying \"stream\" objects do not get garbage collected promptly.  The\r\n  `Connection` will perform a non-async `close()` call on these connections.  This may or may not work, since there may or may\r\n  not be an active event loop in place, but in that case, an error is emitted.  In both cases, the developer should become aware\r\n  of there being a problem.\r\n- `Redis` objects call `_close()` on their connection objects if _they_ get garbage collected.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  To see the `ResourceWarnings`, they need to be enabled.  By default they are suppressed.  Add, for instance\r\nthe `-W default::ResourceWarning` to the python command line.\r\n",

For many tasks making many initial connects, this effectively serialized the pool and could cause\r\ntimeouts to occur even if there is room to create new connections.\r\n\r\n### This PR:\r\n\r\n- makes sure the timeout is only on the `wait_for()` step of the condition variable.\r\n- only waits for a connection slot, an __available__ connection\r\n- perform the `ensure_connection()` (actual connect call) outside of the Condition Variable.\r\n",

This allows us to share code and logic\r\nbetween sync and async code.\r\nA parametrized test is added to test the connection handshake for different client settings against different fake REDIS servers,\r\nboth sync and async.\r\n\r\n- the RESP parser / encoder is simple, assumes utf8 encoding, and always does decoding (from bytes to string.)\r\n-  Decoding uses the 'surrogateescape' convention, so that if binary data was intended (a blob) it can always be recovered by re-encoding.\r\n- Decoding supports most RESP 3 data types\r\n- Encoding assumes utf8, and chooses RESP3 types if protocol 3 is enabled, when appropriate.\r\n- RESP server receives resp command arrays and has handlers to respond.  Can be expanded to perform more extensive Redis emulation\r\n- RESP server can be plugged into a sync or async request handler to simplify testing.\r\n\r\n",

Mocking should use _spec_ when possible.\r\n- Mocking done to `Redis` objects when simulating a cluster in _nocluster_ mode was not done and so the test suite would attempt to return mock objects to a connection pool that had never issued them.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a fix to a permanently disabled Unix connection test is included.\r\n",

Relying on `__del__()` to clean up sockets is not considered good practice since it relies on the peculiarities of the particular implementation, garbage collection and such things.\r\n\r\nIn async redis, a mechanism was added to make an `asyncio.Redis` object _own_ a connection and close it, to provide\r\nbetter connection over connection lifetime.  This was done here:\r\nhttps://github.com/aio-libs-abandoned/aioredis-py/pull/1256\r\nThis mechanism carried over when that library was added to redis-py, and we increasinly rely on it to properly clean up sockets used in asynchronous mode.  However, the mechanism added was cumbersome to use and overly verbose.  In particular, it made it awkward to create a custom `ConnectionPool` instance, hand it to a new `Redis` object, and expect it to close it automatically.\r\n\r\nThis PR, aims to:\r\n\r\n1. fix #2901, adding a new `from_pool()` class method to use instead of the `auto_close_connection_pool` constructor argument.\r\n2. apply the same semantics to the synchronous Redis.\r\n3. Discourage the use of the `auto_close_connection_pool` argument.\r\n\r\nThe following now applies for both _synchronous_ and _asynchronous_ redis:\r\n\r\n- A `Redis` object created without providing a `ConnectionPool` instance, e.g. via `Redis()` or `Redis.from_url()`, will now automatically call `connection_pool.disconnect()` when `call()` is closed.\r\n- A `Redis` object created `Redis.from_pool()`  similarly _takes ownership_ of the pool, and will disconnect the pool.\r\n- As before, if the `connection_pool` argument is used by `Redis.__init__()` this is __not__ done, instead it is assumed the caller\r\nwill close the pool.\r\n- A `Sentinel` object, will use a `from_pool()` class method constructing a `Redis` object to return from the `master_for()` and `slave_for()` methods.\r\n- An `auto_close_connection_pool` `Redis.__init__()` argument is not provided for `redis.Redis`, but kept in place for backwards compatibility for `redis.asyncio.Redis`\r\n\r\nThe above behaviour is controlled by the `auto_close_connection_pool` property of `Redis`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "Here, my concern is primarly around breaking the connection interface. I realize that async is in flux, and frankly many things will be - but this interface is public and exposed, and not internal. Maybe there's another way - without breaking the user contract?",
      "I understand.  I think we can leave this attribute in place.  I'm sure you agree that it feels cludgy, and long.  \r\nDo we have a standard schedule and mechanism to deprecate functionality / arguments in redis-py?\r\n\r\nI'm re-adding it in code, along with a comment on why I think we should try to phase it out.\r\nbasically, if one does _not_ want it auto closed, one should hold a reference to it already, and so it is better to create the pool before passing it to the Redis constructor, rather than fishing it out of Redis later from an internal attribute.\r\n\r\ni.e. this is a healthier pattern\r\n```python\r\npool = ConnectionPool.from_url(url)\r\nclient = Redis(connection_pool=pool)\r\n...\r\npool.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nrather than this:\r\n```python\r\nclient = Redis.from_url(url, auto_close_connection_pool=False)\r\npool = client.connection_pool   # need to fish out the pool so that we can close it later.\r\n...\r\npool.close()\r\n```",

Therefore supporting a connection pool of connection from a different process is not necessary.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, connection pools don't need to deal with different threads either.\r\n\r\nWe remove the checks for process ids, intended to ignore _inherited_ file descriptors  (even though these should probably have been closed on fork anyway).\r\n\r\nWe remove _lenience_ when returning a connection to a pool, it should __always__ be returned to the pool it originated from.  Not doing that would be a resource leak.\r\n\r\nWe simplify `BlockingConnectionPool` since it does not need to do any multi-threading.  It now just adds a simple wait mechanism on top of the `ConnectionPool`, reducing code and overhead.  The `QueueClass` argument is now ignored.  It always was a weird implementation leak anyway\r\n",

      "The pattern you are seeing is a common, but ugly one.  Basically this is correct:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# innermost awaitable\r\nasync def foo() -> int:\r\n    return 1\r\n    \r\ndef bar() -> Awaitable[int]:\r\n    # do stuff, then call foo\r\n    return foo()\r\n    \r\nasync def doit() -> int:\r\n    value = await bar()\r\n    return value + 1  # cannot use \"tail recursion\" here.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this, forwarding the awaitable in a tail-recursion like manner, is fairly common.  I guess people think of it as performing an optimization.  But it is confusing and one of the problems is that it produces incorrect call stacks when debugging.  I'm also fairly certain that chaining multiple \"await\" statements in recursion is not a performance problem in modern python.\r\n\r\nYour pr, changing the methods to be `async`, needs to then also fix the type hinting.  i.e. from\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef foo() -> Awaitable[int]:\r\n   return inner_async_function()\r\n``` \r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```python\r\nasync def foo() -> int:\r\n    return await inner_async_function()\r\n```",
      "Thanks for the feedback.  I have updated the type hints as pointed out.  Indeed I think it's confusing to return the awaitable, especially since that pattern doesn't match the `(p)subscribe()` counterpart functions.  However, I can see that making this change therefore would break some client code, so it's understandable if this PR is eventually not merged.",
      "No, this does not break any code.  `unsubscibe` and `subscribe` were _already_ `async`, in practice, if not marked as such.  they just forwarded an inner awaitable to the outside.  \r\nThe pattern you are fixing is an **antipattern** in my opinion.  It is an attempt to avoid an extra `await` call, but in the process only serves to obscure and confuse.  I am not a maintainer here but I support this change."

Providing this method allows support for standard programming patterns, including the use of the `aclosing` context manager.  Conversely, a `close()` method should be _synchronous_, for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- renames `close()` to  `aclose()` method to several async classes, keeping the old `close()` for backwards compatibility.\r\n- renames a `reset()` to `aclose()`, keeping `close()` and `reset()` for compatibility in the `asyncio.PubSub` class`.\r\n- Adds an `aclose()` method to the async `Pipeline` class, and a `close()` method to the `Pipeline` class.\r\n- Adds an `aclose()` method to the async `ConnectionPool` class and the `close()` method to the sync `ConnectionPool`.\r\n\r\nHaving `close()` / `aclose()` allows the use of the `closing` / `aclosing` context managers.  In particular, they can now be used to manage a `ConnectionPool` instance.\r\n\r\n**Note:** We _keep_ the old asynchronous `close()` methods as alternatives, for backwards compatibility.

However, running **black** and **isort** without their various --check arguments will reformat accordingly.\r\n\r\nAfter doing this all locally - everything checks out.",

      "> @chayim Can you please merge this PR. This lint checker thing is blocking us from publishing the new VSS tutorial. Can we make this check somehow optional (warning, but not blocking the merge).\r\n\r\nI've fixed the PR. There were many missing pieces, as you can see from the multiple commits:\r\n\r\n1. The linter was doing the thing it was programmed to do - at some point someone changed the linter to require 80 character columns (could have been me, but doesn't sound like me - if so sorry!).. something that isn't elsewhere. That was incompatible with the other linter, fixed.\r\n2. There are various external requirements these examples now have - ones that don't exist in the library. CI now has a dedicated requirements file for this, as a result.\r\n3. I've updated the README to indicate how one can contribute.\r\n\r\nIMHO the example text somewhere else **now require** updates indicating that to use these examples you need to install external dependencies. I'll leave that with you.\r\n\r\n@uglide anything else here?",
      "@uglide Got it. Restored. So folks here's the change.\r\n\r\nRegarding #1 above, isort has its own character length rules... since apparently we're not leveraging what's already in use by redis-py (because branch). For now, I've updated the action - they do the same thing.  Squash + merge.",

Redis connections opened with `from-url` don't have their `auto_close_connection` boolean set to `True`, as is the default for a pool which is created automatically.  Therefore, when `Redis.close()` was called, the pool would not close its collections.\r\n2. Even so, garbage collection of the `Connection` objects _ought_ to have closed the sockets associated with the underlying `StreamWriter` objects.  This apparently does not reliably happen, so we re-instate a `__del__` handler for the `AbstractConnection` which does the bare minimum required, calling `StreamWriter.close()`.\r\n3. Add an `auto_close_connection_pool` argument to `asyncio.Redis.from_url()` which defaults to true, same as for `asyncio.Redis()`\r\n\r\nA fix was added to an unrelated test which caused unit tests to fail on non-linux platforms.\r\n\r\n###  Update\r\n\r\nI've changed the PR so as to remove the _2_, above.  In general for `asyncio` Python, socket cleanup is _not_ done on garbage collection (since it involves async operations).  Instead, it is assumed that a well written program performs proper disconnects as needed.  `__del__` handlers instead are used to emit _warnings_, that is, if a socket (or other resource) is found to be not closed when purging an object, a warning is emitted.  This is to make sure resources are released properly by the application.\r\n\r\n Fixing of (1) above ensures that the connection pool is indeed cleaned up correctly.  Trying to put cleanup and IO logic into destructors is in general not thought to be a good practice and should be avoided whenever possible.  Correct program operation should not rely on the prompt execution of `__del__` handlers, and implementing them would deprive us of the built-in resource warnings which would otherwise be emitted.",

      "@kristjanvalur I'm digging through what I think is the initial issue (#2349) and subsequent PR (#2557), and the recent fix in #2859.. and to be honest, a bit flummoxed on why the test _tests/test_asyncio/test_connection.py::test_connection_disconect_race[AsyncRESP2Parser]_ fails, and then cascades.\r\n\r\nIt ends with a timeout issue - but there's something missing in my understanding. Can I talk you into having a look :pray: ? I will continue to do so.",
      "Hi, sure, what does it have to do with this PR?  Where are you seeing the behaviour you describe?",
      "So in theory it doesn't, which is why I'm flumoxxed. On connection we now call redis' identification commands (this is good!) and allow users to not do so should they choose.\r\n\r\nBut, this test fails because we hit the 30s timeout - which was the purpose of the test. Further down the failure deck, everything fails due to what appears to be data in the async retrieval side.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side the stack traces haven't been useful. Using [this CI](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/actions/runs/5711572716/job/15473434838?pr=2857) result as an example after the test fails, we eventually lead to read failures such as below - but honestly that's a red herring. The real issue is data being left in the reader.\r\n\r\n```ERROR tests/test_asyncio/test_timeseries.py::test_get[single-python-parser] - IndexError: pop from empty list```\r\n\r\nTo me, this spells out the need to properly reset the async side prior to each test, but that's another issue.",
      "Okay, I see.  I will try to figure out what is going on.  I was confused because a brief look at the failing tests didn't show me the issue you were speaking of.  but clearly everything blows up.  \r\nAnd yes, the tests are not independent enough somehow.\r\n\r\n",
      "Ok, what is happening, is that the 30s timeout occurs as part of the test harness.  The connect call fails, the test is aborted, but the coroutine running the test is never killed.  i.e., this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith patch.object(asyncio, \"open_connection\", open_connection):\r\n        await conn.connect()\r\n```\r\nnever exits the context manager.  This means that `asyncio.open_connection` remains patched for all subsequent tests.\r\nNow the timeout you see is a weird one, and shouldn't happen.  it comes from base_events.py, here:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntimeout = None\r\n        if self._ready or self._stopping:\r\n            timeout = 0\r\n        elif self._scheduled:\r\n            # Compute the desired timeout.\r\n            when = self._scheduled[0]._when\r\n            timeout = min(max(0, when - self.time()), MAXIMUM_SELECT_TIMEOUT)\r\n\r\n        event_list = self._selector.select(timeout)\r\n```\r\ni.e. we are hitting a hard timeout on select and there is nothing to catch it.   For async, we need async timeouts.\r\nI am also not clear on why you would want this test to suddenly start to timeout like this.   I'll continue to look at what is happening.",
      "This test should not fail during connect, it is designed to test what happens during disconnect.  But I need to find out why the test fails in this particular way, we should get a \"nice\" timeout which should ensure that the patching is undone.\r\n",
      "Ah, it is the \"pytest_timeout\".\r\nYes, if that triggers during an async test, then none of the async cleanup code is executed.  We should never _rely_ on such\r\na timeout to be part of an async test, we should consider it to be only a _failsafe_",
      "So, yes, we are timing out here:\r\n```python\r\n try:\r\n            # set the library name and version\r\n            await self.send_command(\"CLIENT\", \"SETINFO\", \"LIB-NAME\", \"redis-py\")\r\n            await self.read_response()\r\n            await self.send_command(\"CLIENT\", \"SETINFO\", \"LIB-VER\", get_lib_version())\r\n            await self.read_response()\r\n        except ResponseError:\r\n            pass\r\n```\r\nduring the first \"self.read_response()\".  This is because we have already patched the send/receive stuff.  let me find out a way to fix this test.",
      "I've pushed three commits here https://github.com/mainframeindustries/redis-py/tree/client-setinfo\r\nFirst two address problems in testsuite (when running in VSCode, devcontainer), third is the actual fix for your problem.",
      "@kristjanvalur thanks a tonne. I don't think I could have debugged this at all... The byproduct was bizarre - especially since frankly, it seemed completel illogical to me. This is my way of saying :heart: \r\n\r\n@dvora-h can you take a look at merging this into our branch and seeing how it lies.",
      "Right, so, the issue was (to summarize) that the new version handshake wasn't getting through because the test had mocked the streams.  This caused the hard timeout to occur, which stopped the Task (without cleanup) which left the async connection object in a mocked/patched state.\r\nmocking out the command methods was enough to cause the version handshake to become a no-op.",
      "There is a problem with mocking in 3.7, let me fix that.",
      "I've pushed an additional commit fixing 3.7, feel free to merge/cherry pick it.",
      "> Right, so, the issue was (to summarize) that the new version handshake wasn't getting through because the test had mocked the streams.

My gut was down the side of going to repatch the mock for the function.. which I get. Handshaking,  across clients is my current balliwick :D"

If this PR is merged, you can anticipate that Dependabot will immediately submit several PRs to update individual actions.\r\n\r\nAs this change does not touch code nor directly modify the CI test suite, I don't think most of the checkboxes above are applicable. I've read through the contributing doc and think I've followed the document, but please let me know if there's anything additional that needs to be done! :grinning: \r\n\r\nThanks for your work on redis-py!",

For instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nzdiffstore\r\n-4\r\nwrite\r\ndenyoom\r\nmovablekeys\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n@write\r\n@sortedset\r\n@slow\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn such scenarios, using the specified keys helps reduce latency by eliminating the need for an extra server request to fetch the keys. However, this approach means that the client may only have partial knowledge of the keys, preventing complete verification that all the keys in the request belong to the same slot. Nonetheless, if a mismatch occurs, the server will generate an error (e.g., ClusterCrossSlotError), which will be appropriately raised to the user.",

However, according to PEP-508,\r\npython_version marker is compared to first two numbers of Python version\r\ntuple - so it will evaluate to True also on 3.11.3, and install a\r\npackage as a dependency.\r\n\r\n* asyncio: Fix memory leak caused by hiredis (#2693) (#2694)\r\n\r\n* Update example of Redisearch creating index (#2703)\r\n\r\nWhen creating index, fields should be passed inside an iterable (e.g. list or tuple)\r\n\r\n* Improving Vector Similarity Search Example (#2661)\r\n\r\n* update vss docs\r\n\r\n* add embeddings creation and storage examples\r\n\r\n* update based on feedback\r\n\r\n* fix version and link\r\n\r\n* include more realistic search examples and clean up indices\r\n\r\n* completely remove initial cap reference\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Chayim <chayim@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n* Fix incorrect usage of once flag in async Sentinel (#2718)\r\n\r\nIn the execute_command of the async Sentinel, the once flag was being\r\nused incorrectly, with its meaning inverted. To fix we just needed to invert\r\nthe if and else bodies.

      "@anio: Thanks for bringing the issue up!\r\n\r\nI am not convinced that the fix is appropriate, though. As the [source you provide](https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/02/11/the-heisenbug-lurking-in-your-async-code/) mentions:\r\n\r\n> The solution recommended in the docs is to keep a reference to the task for as long as you need it to live.\r\n\r\nThe way I understand it is, that we need to save the task reference beyond the scope of the local / loop variable. As it stands, the reference will be lost almost immediately, rendering the fix ineffective."

      "`__del__()` is only ever called if an object is being garbage collected.  So, no one is interested in it anymore.  There is no logic running which requires that the connection be cleanly disconnected.  It will be sufficient to just also allow the underlying socket to also be garbage collected.\r\n\r\nIn BaseParser, the `__del__` is used to call `on_disconnect`.  But by this time, no one cares (all it does is to set a state flag in the parser)\r\n\r\nIn the Connection, all it does is cause an underlying socket to be cleanly disconnected.  But by this time, all data has been flushed anyway.  And doing things like running the event loop from a __del__ method is not nice at all.\r\n\r\n`__del__()` is very rarely used.  It is mostly used for:\r\n\r\n1. Resource warnings.  It is a good place to detect, e.g. that a socket was not closed, and that someone should have actually used a context manager or a `close()` method somewhere.\r\n2. To resurrect objects, e.g. when doing object caching.  but this behaviour is implementation dependend.]\r\n\r\nIf you read the documentation for `__del__` in the python docs, it should make clear that it is not something you want to use for program control.

This allows remapping the addresses that the cluster nodes advertise about themselves, to something which is accessible to a client.  For example, the nodes might sit behind a NAT, or a reverse proxy, that the nodes themselves don't know about.  The `address_remap` will ensure that the `RedisCluster` object will connect to the _remapped_ addresses when connecting to the cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR could be considered a precursor to  #2695 and #2706  since both of these provide this functionality in order to facilitate unit-tests, albeit only for the `asyncio.RedisCluster`.  Accepting this PR would allow those other PRs to be simplified.\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\nThis feature is inspired by the `host_port_remap` feature described here: https://redis-py-cluster.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html\r\nbut we use a more flexible _callback_ based mechanism rather than a dictionary of rules.",

Timeout-based tests are notoriously (in my experience) prone to failure in this repo, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nAnyway:  I think this is ready for review.  I was thinking that it would probably be best to get this in (or not) before merging my other prs, since fixing the `test_cwe_404.py` for cluster mode relies on this kind of functionality.  I've updated the description to that effect."

And I find that weird given that I have been a large contributor to the `async` part of redis-py for the past year.\r\n\r\n> Initial reaction is that with 5 discrete improvements, this is a \"workspace\". Also consider if 1 year from now someone would need to understand whether this PR caused a regression, it'll be hard to reason about.\r\n\r\nThis PR is essentially started as a bugfix, to fix a regression (#2499), caused by me in pr #2104. \r\n\r\nKeeping connections open after receiving a `BaseException` seemed like a good idea at the time, but I was convinced that it was more trouble than it was worth, (see discussion in #2506) and I changed my pr into essentially a revert of #2104, but with the option of keeping the connection open for special cases, like timeouts.\r\n\r\nThat's the pr.  This then has lingered for months, while I keep it up-to-date.\r\n\r\nRecently, a different incarnation of #2499 showed up.  It caused a flurry of changes to the async code to be made by the maintainers, while a fix for the issue was already here, in  #2506, a fix to _exactly_ that problem\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR contains the following:\r\n\r\n1. A fix for #2499, which happens to be the same as for #2624 and related issues.  This is in `connection.py` and `client.py` for both sync and async.\r\n2. It contains a unit test designed to verify the fix for #2624.\r\n3. It undoes the changes made in response to #2624, which never should have been done.  The changes made, using `asyncio.shield()` are detrimental both for code, performance and other things.  These changes were in `client.py` and `cluster.py` in the `async` part\r\n4. It embraces and fixes the unit-tests which were added in #2624.  They were timing related and the cluster test was not working at all.\r\n\r\nAs such, this PR is really about undoing changes, and adding unit tests.  It really cannot be split into separate PRs because it only works as a whole.\r\n\r\nI could theoretically split the fixes to the `test_cwe_404.py` and the addition of a `remap_host_port` argument to the `RedisCluster` off into a separate PR, but it would make this one dependent on it.  we really, really, should get the old behaviour back and remove the `asyncio.shield()` hack from the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This contains the changes to the unittest, and adds the `remap` feature to the `RedisCluster`.\r\nUnfortunately, my fixing the unittests revealed that `master` is still not fixed.  with regards to the problems that test_cwe_404.py was trying to verify that were fixed.   Only my original fix does that.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any point trying to fix a unit-test which is trying to verify a fundamentally flawed fix to a problem.\r\n\r\nWhat I can do, if it makes this PR more palatable to people, is to collapse all of the changes into a new set of coherent changes so that it is easier to understand what's going on.

We don't want to wrap every operation in a `Task` (performance).  We don't want to acquire and release `asyncio.Lock` objects in different Tasks (deadlocks).  We _want_ to be able to send tasks signals (timeouts, cancels). We don't want unexpected and asymmetric programming constructs in the code without any comment or reason.

Imagine coming across this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/redis-py/blob/7fc4c76c778163c21d396f99dcc710d99942895f/redis/asyncio/client.py#L528-L533\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
      "@kristjanvalur I tried reading #2666 and it wasn't immediately obvious from the PR description what's the issue it's solving (for starters, there was no issue linked).\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly (I have only passing familiarity with asyncio) `asyncio.shield` suppresses propagation of cancels. Guided purely by intuition, it does does smell. Maybe even it should be reverted. But... Chesterton's Fence! — let's understand why users wanted #2666 and maybe look for a way to address that? @chayim, can shed some light on the motivation for #2666?\r\n\r\n(Right now it's a bit \"I wanted to build something else, something good, and your rotten fence was in my way\", and I'm saying that as the person who started the saga with this PR. Happy to jump on a call. I really think you're putting plenty of effort into this, and want to make sure this can bear fruit.)",
      "I don't think Chesterton's fence applies.\r\nPlease allow me to re-state the situation, again.\r\n\r\n1. Last year I made a series of simplifications and changes to the async/client.  One of them was to make it simpler to use subscriptions and I stumbled across code which indiscriminately closed connections when handling BaseExceptions.  I changed that code in good faith, because BaseExceptions normally should be handled.  This was pr #2104 \r\n2. Later, a defect #2499 was opened where it turned out that due to how the connections are pooled, this change broke behaviour.  Connections might get returned to the pool in an incorrect state.  Much was discussed, and I realized that I had been wrong, it is okay and prudent to close connections in this library when something happens.\r\n3. I provided a fix to #2499.  This was pr #2506.  It reverts  #2104, but adds a flag, allowing connections to stay open on error.  This is to support timeouts and retries in subscriptions, which was the original reason I did the change.\r\n4. Three months pass, and the fix does not go in.\r\n5. Another issue shows up.  It is the same issue as #2499, just differently stated.  There is a lot of activity and a series of experimental fixes are made, while #2506 just sits there, a fix to _my_ original regression, which puts things back the way they were.  No one notifies me about this, even though I've been very active in restructuring the async connection classes for the past year and would have been the obvious person to blame.\r\n6. Finally a solution is put in place, using asyncio.shield(),   And the original bug is _still there_.  The fix is supplemented with unit tests which are buggy (there is a missing `await`), slow and ineffective, and it will cause _deadlocks_ if one attempts to perform cancellations in some cases.\r\n7. I become aware of this situation when my unittest, which is designed to trigger exactly this sort of problem with a cancel, deadlocks because of the `shield()` code.  This was, while I was updating my PR, for the umpteenth time, to try to keep it in sync until some maintainer might feel the need to look at it.\r\n8.  I look at the unittests, realize they are broken, fix them, undo the damage done to the async code, and verify that my original PR fixes also this issue.\r\n9. I create a new PR out of the old one to try to point out: Look, the fix was here all along! No need for any of this! and I fixed your unit tests, too, btw.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice for the maintainers to actually show interest in my efforts here. Honestly, I'm trying to help.",
      "I think @chayim should chime in at this point, as he's the author of #2666 and IIUC a maintainer.",
      "Folks, apologies on delays. Life definitely has a way to get in the way.\r\n\r\nFirst off @kristjanvalur Please don't think there's a lack of interest! I'm hoping you can instead view it through the lens of way too many things going on, plus holidays, plus RESP3. But you're right, it's time to pick up the ball.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I'll be the first to admit that *my* async abilities are sub optimal.  Regrettably, other things took priority, as happens. With the upcoming beta of 5.0.0b2 ... @dvora-h will free up a bit, and can return to contributing, reviews, etc.\r\n\r\nNow getting back to this *you're bang on* the asyncio.shield change is absolutely a bandaid, in order to get things secure, and out. It's not ideal - but at the time, with what was known, I felt (perhaps incorrectly) that this was the right move forward.\r\n\r\nNow, back to the PR. I'm a big fan of small, surgical PRs - even if this isn't always the case. To wit, I'm more than happy to rip out the unit tests ```test_cwe_404.py```, especially once there's a full, crafted fix merged. But tl;dr I support the collapsed PR approach.",
      "Hi @chayim.  Great to see you here.  I'm happy to jump through whatever hoops are needed to get things done.\r\n\r\nOne thing I could do is to continue with my `test_cwe_404.py` PR #2706.  Unfortunately as it is, if we add the missing \"async\" call and properly test for the empty pipeline, it fails.  But we _could_ just ignore that case, or mark it as `xfail`, in order to get other things in.  Thje non-pipeline and the cluster tests _do_ work in that pr.",
      "By the way, we _could_ process pr #2706 first. which is a fix for the already existing tests, and then rebase this on top.",
      "I've rebased this now that #2706 was merged.",
      "Thanks @kristjanvalur !\r\n\r\n@chayim I think this is ready for merge",
      "Yay.  Let's hope it fixes some of the other issues we've seen 🌵 "

      "Using the proxy changes from @drago-balto, combined with the current 4.3 branch yields a sideaffect in this particular case. Given the output errors on RuntimeError - we can now be positive, that the fix is truly caught.\r\n\r\nHowever, the byproduct of that is this given case. If you cancel an executing pipeline (as [in our test](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/pull/2672/files#diff-a90c3a19dad7803c9726358f223a3b7b8fb23ccb1d573d580d6640f04fdd3f27R103) then the pipeline object cannot be reused.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's always been possible (and works) to reuse the pipeline object, rather than reinitialize it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr = Redis()\r\npipe = r.pipeline()\r\npipe.set(\"foo\", \"bar\")\r\npipe.execute()\r\n\r\npipe.set(\"bar\", \"blee\")\r\npipe.get(\"foo\")\r\npipe.execute()\r\n````\r\n\r\nHowever, in 4.3 this won't be possible *should* the async be canceled. IMHO this is reasonable, it's a security fix we're backporting to a dead branch. Meaning if you end up in this situation, you can easily catch RuntimeError and move along.\r\n\r\nThoughts community?",
      "@auvipy I haven't seen feedback from anyone.. I let it bake for two weeks, to make sure there's real interest here. Can you confirm - is there - and does this fix work happily for you?  Anyone else, please feel free to weigh in.\r\n\r\nThis version is old enough, that I want to double-check here.",
      "but we are py 3.7+ and pypy 3.8+",
      "Right. Since celery is py 3.7+ this PR isn't needed. That's already covered by existing releases.\r\n\r\n@dvora-h Let's let this bake. If no one *needs* the change, specifically due to python 3.6, we abandon.",
      "but we need to calm down pyup",
      "> but we need to calm down pyup\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a misconfiguration of pyup and IMHO not a reason to release this. I'd rather not extend a potential issue.\r\n\r\nCelery releases clearly support Python 3.7+, especially since 3.6 has been end of lifed.  I went back through the history of the repository and Pypi, and haven't seen an active version support Python 3.6.\r\n\r\nThis has sat long enough, I think we can close.

This is necessary because the CancelledError, as alluded to previously, doesn't trigger - though should.\r\n\r\nOur choices are either to:\r\n1. Raise the RuntimeError , and leave it up to the user. This strikes me as inelligant.\r\n\r\n2. Catch it (as done here). In this case the pipeline will reset properly, and return a None.\r\n\r\nThis final change, has that in it.",
      "Failures are the result of #2670 and unrelated.",
      ":heart: for the backports, folks.\r\n\r\n(Oh, I see 4.3.7 has been tagged but not released yet)",
      "This change makes it impossible to cancel a command and retry, because the cancellation never happens and the single connection lock is held indefinetly.   So, the unit-tests I devised for pr #2506 no longer work.\r\n\r\nIs this really intentional?  Not to cancel operation at all?   Is there a tl/dr somewhere on why this is desirable?",
      "Anyone reading the code will be clueless.  \"Wait, it is creating a new `Task` for each operation?  That adds latency. and then shielding it?  Whatever for?\"  Even the unit tests have no comments on them on what specifically they are trying to fix.",
      "This testing code now breaks:\r\n```python\r\n        ready = asyncio.Event()\r\n\r\n        async def helper():\r\n            with pytest.raises(asyncio.CancelledError):\r\n                # blocking pop\r\n                ready.set()\r\n                await r.brpop([\"nonexist\"])\r\n  \r\n          # if all is well, we can continue.  The following should not hang.\r\n    # DEADLOCK, here:\r\n            await r.set(\"status\", \"down\")\r\n\r\n        task = asyncio.create_task(helper())\r\n        await ready.wait()\r\n        await asyncio.sleep(0.01)\r\n        # the task is now sleeping, lets send it an exception\r\n        task.cancel()  \r\n```\r\nThe task was interrupted with a CancelledError.  but the inner task (shileded()) was not interrupted and continues to wait, hanging on to the `_single_connection_lock` and the second attempt at `r.set()` is now deadlocked.\r\n\r\nBasically, task interruption has been nerfed...  Is there a workaround?  ",
      "For what reason does this shield the sub-task running `_try_send_command_parse_response()`? If I cancel a task that is performing a blocking command on Redis, the shielded subtask crashes with `redis.exceptions.ConnectionError: Connection closed by server.` when the client is closed.\r\n\r\nIn other words: **Always** manage your tasks! Having unmanaged tasks lying around is bad practice.",
      "@agronholm I believe this PR was a mistake.  It is an attempt to fix an issue caused by a regression that I caused last year, but without understanding the problem.  I have had a fix for that regression lying around for four months without being accepted.  \r\n\r\nPlease see pr #2695 which undoes this change and applies the correct fix to the original regression.\r\n"

Previously, if `stop` was _unset_, the stop value would default to -1. If the value being searched was the last element in an array, and `stop` was set to -1, the server would reply with -1 instead of the element's index.\r\n\r\neg.: given a json object myarr: `{\"l\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]}`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocalhost:36379> JSON.ARRINDEX myarr $.l '\"d\"'            # no start or stop set\r\n1) (integer) 3\r\nlocalhost:36379> JSON.ARRINDEX myarr $.l '\"d\"' 0 10000    # stop set to some huge value\r\n1) (integer) 3\r\nlocalhost:36379> JSON.ARRINDEX myarr $.l '\"d\"' 0 -1       # stop set to -1\r\n1) (integer) -1\r\nlocalhost:36379> JSON.ARRINDEX myarr $.l '\"d\"' 0          # start set to 0, but stop omitted\r\n1) (integer) 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy only appending `start` and `stop` values to the `JSON.ARRINDEX` command if they're set, the python client more closely mimics redis' behaviour. \r\n\r\nFixes #2481 ",

Invoking `cancel()` resulted in interruption of StreamReader `readline()` method by the CancelledError. When it happened it resulted in not reading the response from StreamReader after command execution. It caused all future responses to be mixed up between commands.\r\n\r\nFor example if we canceled a `ping()` command and executed `exists('foo')` command afterwards StreamReader reads previously not read `b\"+PONG\\r\\n\"`  instead of `b\":0\\r\\n\"` which results in error when trying to parse raw data and cast it to the correct type.

      "@prokazov given that hiredis isn't a dependency, but is an extra (i.e. ```pip install redis[hiredis]``` we can't enforce a hiredis version on existing users.  This means that the hiredis check now becomes more complicated.\r\n\r\nWe need to wrap the pack_command call, with a check to ensure that hiredis is >= 2.2.1, specifically due to this change, otherwise we'll break the community.\r\n\r\nSimilarly @dvora-h this becomes 4.5.0 as discussed.",
      "@chayim Originally the check was checking for a version. It was later changed to check for the existence of the pack_command exposed in the hiredis. So effectively this validates if the hiredis-py contains this new method so it is backwards compatible."

This lock is also used each time the `initialize` method is called, ensuring that multiple connections aren't spun up if the first time the client is called happens to be with a parallel mechanism.\r\n\r\nWorth mentioning that the use cases for using parallel calling mechanisms in single-client mode are probably limited, though this still seems useful to have in terms of consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Socket disconnects are _graceful_ in that one closes the send direction and can then wait for any data\r\nin transit to arrive, until an EOF is delivered from the remote side.  In `asyncio` parlance this means that to gracefully close a socket, you close the `send` _stream_ and can then read from the `receive` stream until you reach an End Of File.\r\n\r\nThis change makes sure that the internal `BaseParser` state is maintained so that it can continue to request and parse chunks for as long as it can.   Previously, the HiredisParser would get its internal state cleared immediately, and this would cause the read, in progress, to fail with an unexpected error.  Now an ongoing `read_response()` will continue until it succeeds or encounters an error such as EOF.\r\n\r\nA new `read_response()` issued **after** a `disconnect()` call has been issued (but before it completes) will immediately fail, howerver.  This is to maintain previous semantics, even though we **could** simply allow it to go through and fail later when it attemts to read from a closed connection.\r\n",

The current\r\n_read position_ is maintained as simply the _file_position_ of the underlying `BytesIO` buffer.  Similarly,\r\nthe length of buffered data can be queried simply from the buffer by performing a `seek()`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, type hints are added to the `SocketBuffer` class",

Timeouts are now received directly when doing IO, instead of running a preliminary `can_read()` test with timeout.  This resulted in significant simplification of the logic and consolidated different timeout handling.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the `PythonParser`, unlike the `HiredisParser` was not able to deal with IO being interrupted as it didn't maintain internal state.  A TimeoutException caught while parsing a response would cause data to be lost.  The `HiredisParser`, however, cleanly separates parsing and IO, and maintains its own internal parse buffer which is fed by IO separately.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `PythonParser` to keep a buffer of incomplete responses, so that if IO is interrupted, the parser's `read_response()` method can be called again, if it is interrupted during IO.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This is an alternative change to pr #2510\r\n\r\nSee issue #2499 where this problem was pointed out.",

Timeouts are now received directly when doing IO, instead of running a preliminary `can_read()` test with timeout.  This resulted in significant simplification of the logic and consolidated different timeout handling.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the `PythonParser`, unlike the `HiredisParser` was not able to deal with IO being interrupted as it didn't maintain internal state.  A TimeoutException caught while parsing a response would cause data to be lost.  The `HiredisParser`, however, cleanly separates parsing and IO, and maintains its own internal parse buffer which is fed by IO separately.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `PythonParser` to keep a buffer of incomplete responses, so that if IO is interrupted, the parser's `read_response()` method can be called again, if it is interrupted during IO.\r\n\r\nSee also PR #2512 which suggests a slightly different (and probably simpler and better) approach, more in line with how `HiredisParser` works.\r\n\r\nSee issue #2499 where this problem was pointed out.\r\n",

This happens a lot for large payloads.\r\n\r\nI'm the author of an experimental library, asynkit. https://github.com/kristjanvalur/py-asynkit  I've been thinking about adding a feature which would allow _suspendable_ and _resumable_ functions like this, using the `async` and `await` keywords, but without actual IO, to be able to maintain state of a callstack that is paused somehow.  There is no code yet, just an Idea in my head, but that would make for a very clean approach when implemented.",

This has been dicussed in issue #2499.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides \r\n\r\n- A regression test for issue #1128\r\n- A revert of pr #2104, along with comments in the code\r\n- A different way to fix #2103 with an optional argument to `Connection.read_response()`\r\n\r\nA lot of code uses the Command/Response pattern and if an exception occurs during that, the conneciton is in an\r\nindeterminate state:\r\n\r\n - `Connection.send_command()` has no way to continue sending a command if there is a benign interrupt, e.g. a Timeout.  Ensuring that the connection is closed in this case is prudent, because some code does capture BaseExceptions, e.g. `gevent` style code.\r\n - Code often pairs `send_command()` and `read_response()` and even if the error happens in `read_response()` (which is in principle resumable), application code has no way of knowing and so closing the connection is necessary.\r\n \r\n To support `PubSub`, and other cases where an application may want to properly handle Timeouts and other errors while reading reponses, a new argument is added to `read_response()`, which disables the automatic `disconnect()` of the connection when an exception is occurred.  It is then the responsibility of the caller to take appropriate action.\r\n",

If something happened, it's by chance, because most of the time you had to Ctrl-C was during lengthy I/O calls.",
      "In production, where this matters nobody is pressing Ctrl-C. And if they are, they should know not to press it twice if they want sensible shutdown. In the important scenario, like the one [you explained before](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/issues/2499#issuecomment-1348746819), the exception is raised by a framework.

      "> You now disconnect on the outside for any exception. Are you sure this is correct? This will at least disconnect twice sometimes. And are there really no exceptions that should go through without disconnect?\r\nDisconnecting twice is safe.\r\nI think we have established that there should be no exceptions going through without a disconnect.  That was previously the case with _all_ exceptions while reading a response.  Now BaseExceptions don't disconnect, in the `Connection` but they do cause a disconnect in the scope of a `command/response` pair.\r\n> \r\n> Since you are against rolling back #2104, you should denote the API change in the functions affected, because they now have a rather surprising API. `send_command` needs a comment explaining that if it raises, the connection is now in an undefined state and the caller needs to disconnect it. Same for `read_response` and `parse_response`.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect.  It it is only in the case of BaseExceptions that it is kept open, exceptions that are not handled or caught anywhere and typically result in an exit.  (In async code, the TimeoutError _does_ result in a `disconnect()`.\r\n However, since there is no way to restart a partially completed send (the API doesn't support it, even if we would keep track of the sent data), I see no harm in closing it. Particularly since it may help the code jive with gevent.  I'll make a PR to fix the `send_command.`\r\n\r\n (We could, if we wanted, create a different api which could be restarted when a Timeout has previously occurred.)\r\n \r\n> If you succeed with #2510, that comment could change on the async response functions to explaining that if the Exception was a CancellationException, the connection is not undefined, but still holds the previous response. If it is another Exception like KeyboardInterrupt, the connection will still be broken.\r\n\r\nFair point.  Yes, a timeout on read_response really should mean that the application can retry, and that should be documented, I guess, if the opposite is already undocumented.   Otherwise, in all APIs that I am familiar with, a `timeout` on an operation which provides a \"timeout\" parameter, means that the operation can be retried.\r\n\r\n",

For all we know, there could be many other packages out there misusing some functionality of this package...\r\nAlso, there are other breaking changes in this release, so ideally, packages using redis as a dependency should have a version cap.",
      "@utkarshgupta137 I randomly head out to the internet and contribute version caps for reasons like this.

Instead, any keys will be possibly matched through filters (by label, value, etc.) that are part of the syntax. Moreover, the matched keys could be stored in different slots of different cluster nodes (shards). So, when we use RedisCluster client to execute these commands on a Redis Cluster, it makes no sense to use the client's slot finding mechanism in order to choose the node to execute the command (which is the default mechanism for most other commands), because there is no key to be used for that in the arguments of the command. With this change, the aforementioned commands will be handled separately and sent to the default cluster node instead.\r\n\r\nA fix is also included for a case in which the server may respond on the \"COMMAND\" command with a \"subcommands\" field with an empty list as its value, which, along with some other attributes in the response, would lead to an exception because the \"subcommands\" field was not checked before for equaling to an empty list.",

      "Glad to help @chayim! :smile: By the way, writing the documentation for Redis Cluster, i noticed that although you can pass `retry_on_error` to `RedisCluster`'s constructor it basically has no effect, because the `execute_command` method uses:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nconnection.send_command(*args)\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of:\r\n```python\r\nconnection.retry.call_with_retry(blablabla)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a reason for not using `call_with_retry`?

AsyncIO Cluster mode has not been providing `Lock`, due to the fact that the `core.py` trying to find the `connection_pool` attribute where it's not provided in the AsyncIO cluster client. This change will try to find `get_encoder` in the client if `connection_pool` is unavailable.\r\n\r\nAlso, this change copies the` lock` method of AsyncIO client (please let me know if this is not appropriate), providing the same API to the users whether they are using non-cluster or cluster.\r\n\r\nAn example is not added as there is no currently available cluster-mode-only example for asyncio Redis.\r\n\r\nCloses: #2420 ",

This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)).

I might have broken some other things (or not), and I'm sure there are some rookie mistakes in the changes.. but it works for me.. and I've spent quite some hours on this.\r\nSo I hope someone who's more experienced could help pickup my improvements for the project, and improve upon it.\r\nI'm guessing there also needs a bit of testing to get extended.\r\nI unfortunately have no resources to complete that, and run the complete set op tests, and to investigate the results.\r\nI've ran my test.py (see examples/) using python3.10.4 and the docker image redis-modcluster and that works fine for my usecase (looking from the surface, in my brief tests), I unfortunately have to carry-on doing other stuff.\r\nThanks in advance!",

      "@utkarshgupta137 I was hopping you would check this out and provide pointers or improvements. As said, i'm really inexperienced with all this and hoped to help out.. but i was really struggling by comparing sync cluster, pipeline and json() with the current implemented async code, so just started copying stuff, run it, and patching the next exception in any way I could think of, till I got it working and then I was drained and confused by how things got to the point where it started to work ;-)",

I hope you might have some more pointers, I'm happy to learn.\r\n\r\nps. also, when I removed RedisCluster from ClusterPipeline's inheritance the json\\__init__.py is not accepting the parameters in AsyncioClusterPipeline() anymore at line 178\r\n\r\nKR\r\n",

This is probably a carry-over from the \r\nnon-async version, but in asyncio, it is not needed.  We can read directly from the `_stream` which is a `StreamReader` with\r\nan internal buffer of 64KB. \r\n\r\nThis change removes redundant code and speeds up python parsing by relying on already-provided buffering and `readline()` functionality.\r\n",

The values in the `MSET` are images, generally around 5 to 6kb in size. From what I can see it was certain images within a very specific size range, where the length \r\n of the value was just under 6000, that caused the problem (6000 being the `buffer_cutoff` value used in `pack_commands`).\r\n\r\n(Note that in some/many cases the `b\"\"` doesn't seem to cause a problem; I wrote a simple script to reproduce the error, executing the code in the standard `asyncio` event loop, but couldn't reproduce it that way. It was only by creating a simple Falcon/uvicorn app and executing it within that that I could reproduce it; I guess it's to do with the fact that uvicorn uses `uvloop` instead of the asyncio event loop, and there must be some difference in the underlying SSL transport.)",

      "@chayim Thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning is that pulling in two dependencies (`deprecated` and its dependency `wrapt`) just to basically format a string and call `warnings.warn()` in 5 places is unwarranted. I also feel there's a nonzero supply chain risk in it for such a heavily used project such as `redis-py`. (One could also argue that it's more cost-effective bandwidth-wise, and better for the environment to not have the world necessarily [download those extra dependencies some million times per day](https://pepy.tech/project/redis)...)\r\n\r\nAs for the expressiveness, if you're thinking about e.g. introspecting functions to see whether they're `@deprecated`, I don't think that really matters..?\r\n\r\nFor instance, Django happily just calls `warnings.warn` without a wrapper wherever they need to warn about a deprecation, á la https://github.com/django/django/blob/10bb21e71e3668f770493e2af0d0e0271830f7a3/django/db/models/expressions.py#L1551-L1561 ...",

Each cluster node will share the cluster's Retry object for retry and backoff policy. \r\n2. **Fixed \"cannot pickle '_thread.lock' object\" bug**- When we use NodesManager's initialize function to refresh the cluster topology after a failover, if the chosen startup node was the failed node, we received the above exception when trying to copy the connection kwargs (traceback at the end), and this error was raised to the user since it was not expected. It caused the initialize loop to get stuck on the failed node and not continue. Removed the copy of kwargs as it no longer needed since we call str_if_bytes on the conncetion's responses. We now throw exceptions in the initialize() loop only if there are no more startup nodes available. Closing #2354 #2297 \r\n3. **Removing the failed target node from the seed nodes when connection/timeout errors occur:** the failed target node will return to the startup nodes if discovered on the cluster slots, but we'll skip it in this initialize iteration.\r\n4.  **Backwards comparability for connection_error_retry_attempts** - connection_error_retry_attempts can still be used to pass the number of retries to execute on connection/timeout error. If connection_error_retry_attempts = 0 and retry object isn't being passed, no retries will be done on connecton/timeout errors for the cluster.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):   File \"/home/ubuntu/redis-py/redis/cluster.py\", line 1424, in initialize\r\n\r\n    copy_kwargs = copy.deepcopy(kwargs)\r\n\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/copy.py\", line 146, in deepcopy\r\n\r\n    y = copier(x, memo)\r\n\r\n...\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/copy.py\", line 146, in deepcopy\r\n\r\n    y = copier(x, memo)\r\n\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/copy.py\", line 231, in _deepcopy_dict\r\n\r\n    y[deepcopy(key, memo)] = deepcopy(value, memo)\r\n\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/copy.py\", line 161, in deepcopy\r\n\r\n    rv = reductor(4)\r\n\r\nTypeError: cannot pickle '_thread.lock' object\r\n```",

For this use case, it is fine that the read data is discarded.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining use case was in the `PubSub` implementation, but that can be done differently.\r\n\r\nRenaming the method to `can_read_destructive()` and simplifying it, getting rid of the \"keep any read data for next read\" logic, paves the way for further simplifications of the asyncio connection code, and other pull requests in the same ares (getting rid of locking, buffering, simplifying timeouts, etc)\r\n\r\nThe PR contains elements from Pull Requests #2356 and #2104 as necessary for it to work properly",

Whatever the reason, simply trying to connect to localhost (and getting a connection error, or worse: no error at all) will not be helpful in finding the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nA counterpoint to this PR could be: strictly speaking urls without explicit hosts are valid, and a case could be made that relying on that behavior is perfectly valid.\r\n",

This is not required, since only a single task should be sending/receiving on a single `Connection` at the same time.\r\nThere is no lock around the `send()` code and \r\nWithout a lock around the entire `execute_command()` (send, and receive) there has been no guarantee that a response is returned which matches the sent command, if more than one task are sending.\r\n\r\nA single unittest for concurrent execution was skipped to not run in single-connection mode.  This unittest would have also sporadically failed before this PR if the concurrent commands were different.  As it happened, all 10 were the exact same ping command and so mismatching requests/responses were never detected.",

Instead async timeout mechanisms are used at the highest level to time out operations.\r\n\r\nThe use of `can_read` is a holdover from the non-async times, when timeout had to happen at the lowest level, at the actual blocking socket call.  With asyncio, timeouts happen higher up in the stack.  This allows for simplifications, because there is no longer any need to have timeout code lower down in the stack.\r\n\r\n`can_read()` is still kept around, but its only use now is assertions in the `ConnectionPool`.  This could be simplified further, since having `can_read()` around requires additional code paths for read, but not consumed, data.\r\n\r\nObsolete code pertaining to blocking exceptions was also removed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `get_message()` now accepts `timeout=None` argument to wait indefinitely for a message.\r\n",

      "Well, the `timeout=None` was actually just something I threw in there as a bonus.  My primary purpose with this PR was to remove some of the cruft in the `async` code which exists because it is a direct copy of the `non-async` code.  Timeouts in blocking code need to be handled at the IO level, while in `async` they are generally free, and implemented via the event loop.\r\n\r\nI had actually been thinking about removing this \"feature\" and adding it separately, post-hoc, to make the PR more \"clean\".\r\n\r\nBut whatever you think is best, I'm happy with.

Further investigation showed that this was due to the fact that the `connection` only performed a just-in-time connect in the `can_read()` method, which is only invoked if the operation to read a message has a _timeout_.  In particular, using `listen()` to get the message, instead of the `get_message()` with a timeout, the `can_read()` method isn't called, and so a `connect()` call is not made.\r\n\r\nThis issue is present in both non-async and async versions of the library as demonstrated with the unit-test code.\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes this by adding a just-in-time connect to the `read_response` call of both the `Connection` object.",

If dynamic_startup_nodes is set to true, the nodesManager will set the startup nodes to all of the discovered nodes and they will be used to determine the cluster nodes-slots mapping in the next topology refresh.\r\n\r\nWhen true, the initial passed startup nodes will be removed if their endpoints aren't listed in the CLUSTER SLOTS output. For example, if dynamic DNS endpoints are used for startup nodes, but CLUSTER SLOTS lists specific IP addresses, the passed startup nodes will be overridden with the specific nodes' IP. \r\nTherefore, it is recommended to keep dynamic_startup_nodes set to false with DNS endpoints.\r\n\r\n",

Passing the commands to `asyncio.RedisCluster.execute_command` as uppercase strings fixed the problem.\r\n\r\nThis change makes sure that commands passed to `asyncio.CommandsParser.get_keys` are always uppercased when used with the `self.commands` dict. This behavior is consistent with the blocking client. I thought that the commands maybe should be uppercased before being passed to `get_keys` but I haven't been able to find any code that looks like it does that. For reference, I was using commands from a proprietary Redis module.",

This depends on libc versions.\r\n2) Setting incorrect expire times because the input datetime object has a timezone but is passed to mktime without converting to UTC first.\r\n\r\nSince Python 3.3 datetime has a timestamp function which converts to UTC before calling mktime internally.\r\nI changed all direct uses of mktime to use this instead.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce the issues\r\n\r\nDST:\r\n```\r\nimport datetime\r\nimport time\r\nfrom dateutil.tz import tzfile\r\n\r\ndt = datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=tzfile('/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Santiago'))\r\nprint(dt.timestamp())\r\n# this will fail with OverflowError because the timezone has DST flag set to 1 at this date\r\nprint(time.mktime(dt.timetuple()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo DST, conversion works but results in incorrect Unix timestamp due to non-timezone aware conversion:\r\n```\r\nimport datetime\r\nimport time\r\nfrom dateutil.tz import tzfile\r\n\r\ndt = datetime.datetime(2000, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=tzfile('/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Santiago'))\r\nprint(dt.timestamp())\r\n# conversion works because DST flag set to 0 but unixtime is wrong\r\nprint(time.mktime(dt.timetuple()))\r\n```",

      "Fix timezone handling for datetime to unixtime conversions (#2213)\n\n* Fix timezone handling for datetime to unixtime conversions\r\n\r\ndatetime objects are supported to set expire, these can have timezones.\r\nmktime was used to convert these to unixtime. mktime in Python however is not timezone aware, it expects the input to be UTC and redis-py did not convert the datetime timestamps to UTC before calling mktime.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to:\r\n1) Setting incorrect expire times because the input datetime object has a timezone but is passed to mktime without converting to UTC first.\r\n2) When the datetime timestamp is within DST, mktime fails with \"OverflowError: mktime argument out of range\" because UTC doesn't have DST. This depends on libc versions.\r\n\r\n* linters\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: dvora-h <67596500+dvora-h@users.noreply.github.com>"

As described on #2179, in asyncio mode, there are currently no retries on other errors than `TimeoutError` errors.\r\n\r\nTo fix that bug the PR first makes the way retries are configured consistent in sync and async. It then modifies the `_disconnect_raise` function not to raise on any \"supported error\".\r\n\r\n**Note**: I think there are other problems with the retry configuration API, but for now I just wanted to fix the actual bug while making the retry configuration API consistent between sync and async.\r\n\r\nFixes #2179.\r\n\r\n### Pull Request check-list\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `$ tox` pass with this change (including linting)?\r\n- [x] Do the CI tests pass with this change (enable it first in your forked repo and wait for the github action build to finish)?\r\n- [x] Is the new or changed code fully tested?\r\n- [x] Is a documentation update included (if this change modifies existing APIs, or introduces new ones)?

Currently, only `Redis` class supports `lock()`. https://github.com/redis/redis-py/pull/1937 added lua scripting support for `RedisCluster` which is a prerequisite for locking support, so with that out of the way, this PR finishes adding support for the `.lock()` method.\r\n\r\nThe change is relatively simple: we just copy and paste the `Redis.lock()` implementation onto `RedisCluster.lock()`. However, we do change the `Lock` implementation for acquiring the encoder if necessary. Instead of calling `self.redis.connection_pool.get_encoder()`, we now call `self.redis.get_encoder()`. Both of these methods already exist so it _shouldn't_ be breaking (?).\r\n",

That will come in a following PR.\r\n\r\nMuch of this change was ~stolen~ adapted from `redis-py-cluster`.\r\n\r\nImplements the following commands:\r\n* EVAL: the command is sent to the cluster depending on the keys (i.e., in `EVAL <SCRIPT> num_keys KEY1 ... KEYN ...`); the keys must all be on the same node. If the script requires 0 keys, the command is sent to a random node.\r\n* EVALSHA: same implementation as above\r\n* SCRIPT EXISTS: the command is sent to all primaries. The result is a list of booleans. Each boolean is an AND of \"does the script exist on each node\". In other words, each boolean is True iff the script exists on all nodes.\r\n* SCRIPT FLUSH: the command is sent to all primaries. The result is a bool AND over all nodes' responses.\r\n* SCRIPT LOAD: the command is sent to all primaries. The result is the SHA1 digest.\r\n\r\nI have not (yet?) implemented the `EVAL_RO` commands -- do those need to be implemented? Maybe.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not implement, nor do I intend to implement:\r\n* SCRIPT KILL\r\n* scripting support with a cluster pipeline\r\n\r\nI have added a couple unit tests for the newly-implemented things. ~I have not yet added documentation to the PR, but I will.~\r\n",

This has been tested with a script that increments a counter by 1 every second and then running `kill -9` on the Redis master.  As expected, there's a delay while the sentinels figure out what the new master should be, and then the script continues.\r\n\r\nI'm not very familiar with the code, so I'm not sure if this is the ideal place for this code.  It is possible that it would make more sense to put it in the connection itself.\r\n\r\nWhile this will need a new test, I'm not sure how to create an automated test that `kill -9`s one of the Redis servers, I'm not sure if this fix needs documentation, and I'm not sure if I should add an example\r\n",

If no key exists, the value will be initialized as ``amount``\r\n> For more information check https://redis.io/commands/incr\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect and misleading, since Redis's documentation of `incr` contains no mention of `amount`.\r\n\r\nThis change sets up `incr` and `decr` as direct aliases of `incrby` and `decrby` by assignment. This also means they share docstrings, so that both will lead to `incrby` and `decrby`'s original references. I think this makes more sense given the function signatures. (I checked the generated Sphinx documentation and it is identical, other than the Redis URLs).\r\n\r\nI also removed the comment in `incrby` that claims it is an alias of `incr`. I think it's the other way around, and I don't think the comment is adding much. Perhaps it's more useful to document the fact that `incr` is an alias of `incrby` for backwards compatibility...?",

This check doesn't need to be run since it's an overhead for the client and is already handled by the server's ClusterDown error. Additionally, some managed Redis clusters, such as ElastiCache, don't support the 'config' command, so the client will not work with the default configurations if we keep the node's configuration check. Other clients (e.g. Lettuce, Jedis) doesn't run this check as well.",

I also learned that `socket.shutdown` and `socket.close` have different purposes: https://stackoverflow.com/a/598759\r\n\r\nSo, you still need to run `socket.close` after `socket.shutdown` to allow garbage collection to deallocate the socket.\r\n\r\nCurrently, redis-py's `Connection.disconnect()` won't continue to close the socket if it encounters an `OSError` on shutdown. This prevents garbage collection from cleaning up the socket and will use more memory than necessary (maybe even causing a leak?).\r\n\r\nThis PR puts a separate try/except around `socket.close` and `socket.shutdown` to allow the socket to be closed after a failed shutdown.",

The 'health_check' value is set to **not self.subscribed**, which checks if the pubsub instance has any items in the channels/patterns lists. That means, that we perform a health check within the execute_command function only if we are not yet subscribed. All subsequent commands, after the first subscription, should be executed without performing a health check, since the channels/patterns list is no longer empty.\r\nThe pubsub's 'get_messages()' method can be used to poll published messages after a pubsub instance has been created. If a poller thread is created (thread that waits on get_message()) it will listen on the same socket as the pubsub execute_command is listening to when it performs a health check. Hence, we should not send a healthcheck using the pubsub execute_command function after the poller thread is initiated, since then it will be racing the poller thread to read the response from the socket.\r\n\r\nIn the example in #1720 we see the following flow:\r\n\r\n1. PubSub instance is being created\r\n2. Channel 'foo' is being subscribed - health check is performed since self.channels is empty\r\n3. 'PONG' is received \r\n4. A poller thread is being started, looping on 'get_messages()'\r\n5. The poller thread polls the 'subscribe' response\r\n6. Channel 'foo' is being unsubscribed, health check is not being performed since self.channels still contains 'foo'. 'foo' is removed from self.channels\r\n7. The poller thread polls the 'unsubscribe' response\r\n8. Channel 'baz' is being subscribed - health check is performed since self.channels is empty again\r\n9. The poller thread tries to poll the 'subscribe' response and gets the 'PONG' response instead\r\n10. The health check waits for a PONG response that has already been received by the poller thread, and is therefore timed out\r\n\r\nTherefore, we shouldn't use self.channels and self.patterns to determine whether a health check needs to be executed, but we should have another variable to indicate whether this is the first command execution, and if so, to run a health check. \r\n\r\nHowever, a poller thread may be started before subscribing to a channel, e.g. :\r\n\r\n1. ps = r.pubsub()\r\n2. poller = threading.Thread(target=poll, args=(ps,))\r\n3. ps.subscribe('foo')\r\n\r\nIn this case, the health check will be performed and we will still get a race reading from the socket with the poller thread. \r\nSo, my suggestion is to add a new 'cmd_execution_health_check' variable initiated with 'True' to the pubsub class and to set it to False on: \r\n1. The end of execute_command method, so the health check will be performed only on the first execution), or\r\n2. get_message() function, so the health check will not be performed from the execute_command function at all.\r\nhealth checks are being done by the get_message() method, so no need to execute it also from the main command execution.  \r\n\r\nThis change fixes the reported bug.",

If none of the startup nodes\r\nare reachable, a 'RedisClusterException' will be thrown.\r\nAfter a connection to the one of the cluster's nodes is established, the\r\nRedisCluster instance will be initialized with 3 caches:\r\na slots cache which maps each of the 16384 slots to the node/s handling them,\r\na nodes cache that contains ClusterNode objects (name, host, port, redis connection)\r\nfor all of the cluster's nodes, and a commands cache contains all the server\r\nsupported commands that were retrieved using the Redis 'COMMAND' output.\r\n\r\nRedisCluster instance can be directly used to execute Redis commands. When a\r\ncommand is being executed through the cluster instance, the target node(s) will\r\nbe internally determined. When using a key-based command, the target node will\r\nbe the node that holds the key's slot.\r\nCluster management commands or other cluster commands have predefined node\r\ngroup targets (all-primaries, all-nodes, random-node, all-replicas), which are\r\noutlined in the command’s function documentation.\r\nFor example, ‘KEYS’ command will be sent to all primaries and return all keys\r\nin the cluster, and ‘CLUSTER NODES’ command will be sent to a random node.\r\nOther management commands will require you to pass the target node/s to execute\r\nthe command on.\r\n\r\n``` pycon\r\n    >>> # target-nodes: the node that holds 'foo1's key slot\r\n    >>> rc.set('foo1', 'bar1')\r\n    >>> # target-nodes: the node that holds 'foo2's key slot\r\n    >>> rc.set('foo2', 'bar2')\r\n    >>> # target-nodes: the node that holds 'foo1's key slot\r\n    >>> print(rc.get('foo1'))\r\n    b'bar'\r\n    >>> # target-nodes: all-primaries\r\n    >>> print(rc.keys())\r\n    [b'foo1', b'foo2']\r\n    >>> # target-nodes: all-nodes\r\n    >>> rc.flushall()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Specifying Target Nodes:**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, some RedisCluster commands will require you to provide the\r\ntarget node/s that you want to execute the command on, and in other cases, the\r\ntarget node will be determined by the client itself. That being said, ALL\r\nRedisCluster commands can be executed against a specific node or a group of\r\nnodes by passing the command kwarg `target_nodes`.\r\nThe best practice is to specify target nodes using RedisCluster class's node\r\nflags: PRIMARIES, REPLICAS, ALL_NODES, RANDOM. When a nodes flag is passed\r\nalong with a command, it will be internally resolved to the relevant node/s.\r\nIf the nodes topology of the cluster changes during the execution of a command,\r\nthe client will be able to resolve the nodes flag again with the new topology\r\nand attempt to retry executing the command.\r\n\r\n``` pycon\r\n    >>> from redis.cluster import RedisCluster as Redis\r\n    >>> # run cluster-meet command on all of the cluster's nodes\r\n    >>> rc.cluster_meet(Redis.ALL_NODES, '127.0.0.1', 6379)\r\n    >>> # ping all replicas\r\n    >>> rc.ping(Redis.REPLICAS)\r\n    >>> # ping a specific node\r\n    >>> rc.ping(Redis.RANDOM)\r\n    >>> # ping all nodes in the cluster, default command behavior\r\n    >>> rc.ping()\r\n    >>> # execute bgsave in all primaries\r\n    >>> rc.bgsave(Redis.PRIMARIES)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could also pass ClusterNodes directly if you want to execute a command on a\r\nspecific node / node group that isn't addressed by the nodes flag. However, if\r\nthe command execution fails due to cluster topology changes, a retry attempt\r\nwill not be made, since the passed target node/s may no longer be valid, and\r\nthe relevant cluster or connection error will be returned.\r\n\r\n``` pycon\r\n    >>> node = rc.get_node('localhost', 6379)\r\n    >>> # Get the keys only for that specific node\r\n    >>> rc.keys(node)\r\n    >>> # get Redis info from a subset of primaries\r\n    >>> subset_primaries = [node for node in rc.get_primaries() if node.port > 6378]\r\n    >>> rc.info(subset_primaries)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can use the RedisCluster instance to obtain the Redis instance\r\nof a specific node and execute commands on that node directly. The Redis client,\r\nhowever, cannot handle cluster failures and retries.\r\n\r\n``` pycon\r\n    >>> cluster_node = rc.get_node(host='localhost', port=6379)\r\n    >>> print(cluster_node)\r\n    [host=127.0.0.1,port=6379,name=127.0.0.1:6379,server_type=primary,redis_connection=Redis<ConnectionPool<Connection<host=127.0.0.1,port=6379,db=0>>>]\r\n    >>> r = cluster_node.redis_connection\r\n    >>> r.client_list()\r\n    [{'id': '276', 'addr': '127.0.0.1:64108', 'fd': '16', 'name': '', 'age': '0', 'idle': '0', 'flags': 'N', 'db': '0', 'sub': '0', 'psub': '0', 'multi': '-1', 'qbuf': '26', 'qbuf-free': '32742', 'argv-mem': '10', 'obl': '0', 'oll': '0', 'omem': '0', 'tot-mem': '54298', 'events': 'r', 'cmd': 'client', 'user': 'default'}]\r\n    >>> # Get the keys only for that specific node\r\n    >>> r.keys()\r\n    [b'foo1']\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Multi-key commands:**\r\n\r\nRedis supports multi-key commands in Cluster Mode, such as Set type unions or\r\nintersections, mset and mget, as long as the keys all hash to the same slot.\r\nBy using RedisCluster client, you can use the known functions (e.g. mget, mset)\r\nto perform an atomic multi-key operation. However, you must ensure all keys are\r\nmapped to the same slot, otherwise a RedisClusterException will be thrown.\r\nRedis Cluster implements a concept called hash tags that can be used in order\r\nto force certain keys to be stored in the same hash slot, see \r\n[Keys hash tag](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec#keys-hash-tags).\r\nYou can also use nonatomic for some of the multikey operations, and pass keys\r\nthat aren't mapped to the same slot. The client will then map the keys to the\r\nrelevant slots, sending the commands to the slots' node owners. Non-atomic\r\noperations batch the keys according to their hash value, and then each batch is\r\nsent separately to the slot's owner.\r\n\r\n``` pycon\r\n    #  Atomic operations can be used when all keys are mapped to the same slot\r\n    >>> rc.mset({'{foo}1': 'bar1', '{foo}2': 'bar2'})\r\n    >>> rc.mget('{foo}1', '{foo}2')\r\n    [b'bar1', b'bar2']\r\n    # Non-atomic multi-key operations splits the keys into different slots\r\n    >>> rc.mset_nonatomic({'foo': 'value1', 'bar': 'value2', 'zzz': 'value3')\r\n    >>> rc.mget_nonatomic('foo', 'bar', 'zzz')\r\n    [b'value1', b'value2', b'value3']\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Cluster PubSub:**\r\n\r\nWhen a ClusterPubSub instance is created without specifying a node, a single\r\nnode will be transparently chosen for the pubsub connection on the\r\nfirst command execution. The node will be determined by:\r\n 1. Hashing the channel name in the request to find its keyslot\r\n 2. Selecting a node that handles the keyslot: If read_from_replicas is\r\n    set to true, a replica can be selected.\r\n    \r\n*Known limitations with pubsub:*\r\n\r\nPattern subscribe and publish do not work properly because if we hash a pattern \r\nlike fo* we will get a keyslot for that string but there is a endless   \r\npossibilities of channel names based on that pattern that we can’t know in \r\nadvance. This feature is not limited but the commands is not recommended to use \r\nright now. \r\nSee [redis-py-cluster documentaion](https://redis-py-cluster.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pubsub.html) \r\n for more.\r\n\r\n``` pycon\r\n    >>> p1 = rc.pubsub()\r\n    # p1 connection will be set to the node that holds 'foo' keyslot\r\n    >>> p1.subscribe('foo')\r\n    # p2 connection will be set to node 'localhost:6379'\r\n    >>> p2 = rc.pubsub(rc.get_node('localhost', 6379))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Read Only Mode**\r\n\r\nBy default, Redis Cluster always returns MOVE redirection response on accessing \r\na replica node. You can overcome this limitation and scale read commands with \r\nREADONLY mode. \r\n\r\nTo enable READONLY mode pass read_from_replicas=True to RedisCluster \r\nconstructor. When set to true, read commands will be assigned between the\r\nprimary and its replications in a Round-Robin manner. \r\n\r\nYou could also enable READONLY mode in runtime by running readonly() method,  \r\nor disable it with readwrite().\r\n\r\n``` pycon\r\n    >>> from cluster import RedisCluster as Redis\r\n    # Use 'debug' mode to print the node that the command is executed on\r\n    >>> rc_readonly = Redis(startup_nodes=startup_nodes, \r\n                    read_from_replicas=True, debug=True)\r\n    >>> rc_readonly.set('{foo}1', 'bar1')\r\n    >>> for i in range(0, 4):\r\n            # Assigns read command to the slot's hosts in a Round-Robin manner\r\n    >>>     rc_readonly.get('{foo}1')\r\n    # set command would be directed only to the slot's primary node\r\n    >>> rc_readonly.set('{foo}2', 'bar2')\r\n    # reset READONLY flag\r\n    >>> rc_readonly.readwrite()\r\n    # now the get command would be directed only to the slot's primary node\r\n    >>> rc_readonly.get('{foo}1')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee [Redis Cluster tutorial](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial) and\r\n[Redis Cluster specifications](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec)\r\nto learn more about Redis Cluster.\r\n",

This means that `PubSub` objects are not garbage collected immediately, when their refcount decreases to zero, they're collected asynchronously using generational GC.\r\n\r\nAlso, `PubSub` defines a destructor that releases a connection from pool. Pool uses threading.Lock when managing connections. If some pool method grabs the lock and at the same time `PubSub` object is garbage collected (which is pretty likely as our celery instances lock up at least once a week), `PubSub` destructor deadlocks forever waiting for a lock that will be never released.\r\n\r\nI've decided that the only solution to this problem is to avoid creating circular references to `PubSub` objects.\r\n\r\nTest look weird and I'm worried that it is a bit fragile, but I failed to devise a scheme that would cause Python garbage collector to run at exact moment in time when the pool is inside critical section. So the test run enough cycles to cause a problem. But different interpreters/different gc settings may cause a test to finish without locking up. I don't know how to solve that.\r\n\r\nIt runs on CPython 3.9 though: without weakref changes, the test will hang forever until pytest-timeout will cancel it.\r\n",

line will cover the previous one if we set `info[key] = value`.\r\n\r\nAltinatively, we can prepare a list for `module` content, and set `info['modules'] = module_list` when we catch one or more

First of all thanks for checking this.\r\nThere is an \"ACL LOG\" command added in [Redis 6 RC2](https://github.com/antirez/redis/compare/6.0-rc1...6.0-rc2). I tried to add it to redis-py.\r\n\r\nThe \"ACL LOG\" command supports two kind of arguments: `ACL LOG [<count> | RESET]`. For `<count>`, it returns a acl log list. For `RESET`, it returns 'OK'. So I parsed it into:\r\n```\r\nThe original response for 'ACL LOG':\r\n[[b'count', 1, b'reason', b'command', b'context', b'toplevel', b'object', b'set', b'username', b'duck', b'age-seconds', b'1.958', b'client-info', b'id=3180 addr=127.0.0.1:59566 fd=9 name= age=105 idle=0 flags=N db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=-1 qbuf=30 qbuf-free=32738 obl=0 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=set user=duck']]\r\n\r\nThe redis-py output for 'ACL LOG':\r\n[{'count': 1, 'reason': 'command', 'context': 'toplevel', 'object': 'set', 'username': 'duck', 'age-seconds': 1.958, 'client-info': {'id': 3180, 'addr': '127.0.0.1:59566', 'fd': '9', 'name': '', 'age': 105, 'idle': 0, 'flags': 'N', 'db': 0, 'sub': 0, 'psub': 0, 'multi': -1, 'qbuf': 30, 'qbuf-free': 32738, 'obl': 0, 'oll': 0, 'omem': 0, 'events': 'r', 'cmd': 'set', 'user': 'duck'}}]\r\n\r\n-------------------- break --------------------\r\n\r\nThe original response for 'ACL LOG RESET':\r\nb'OK'\r\n\r\nThe redis-py output for 'ACL LOG RESET':\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the wget link in `.travis.yml` is changed as well since the RC1 does not have a `LOG` sub-command for `ACL`.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look. It's my first PR for open-source project. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

When running process is broken or offline, one of the other 3 can takeover. In order to to that, we use a lock to make sure only one prcess is running, and this process extends  lock every 8 seconds before a timeout(10 seconds).\r\n\r\nIf without the new option `keep_remaining`(not sure if it's a good arg name that makes itself clear), the `tll` will get longer and longer, failover time will be unacceptable long.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are many workarounds (see https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/issues/629 for example), but I think it would be better for redis-py to support this.\r\n\r\nclose https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/issues/629\r\n",

You don't need to worry about what a system package is called on your Linux distribution, or figure out how to build for Mac from scratch.\r\n\r\n​Setup with ENVy is as simple as typing `envy up` for any project you want to work on. Running `envy nuke` removes all traces of that environment.\r\nWith ENVy, you don't need to hunt down a lint command or ask how you run the tests. `envy -h` shows you all the commands you can run - or just jump into a shell with `envy shell`.\r\n​\r\nYou can read more about ENVy [here](http://envy-project.github.io/), but the short version is that we think it'll make it easier for contributors to help out.\r\n​\r\nThis PR adds an `ENVyfile`, the file that describes a development environment and contains the commands to run. We used redis-py while developing in order to test ENVy, and we hoped you'd consider committing this file to help out casual contributors.\r\n\r\nWhile redis-py doesn't have a particularly complex setup guide, setting up a redis cluster to test on is non-trivial. This is especially true if contributors want to run the tests under all the python versions that tox demands. The envyfile provided here starts up a dockerized redis cluster which works out of the box. The cluster is similar to the one under Vagrant, and can be used to run the tests.\r\n * `envy console` will drop contributors into a python session inside the development container with a helpful message on how to connect to the basic redis instance. This can be used as an interactive session for new users who want to try out redis-py, and as a full development environment for contributors.\r\n * `envy test` runs the tox tests under python3.6\r\n * `envy test-all` runs the tox tests under all specified python versions\r\n * `envy lint` runs the tox linter\r\n\r\nSince envy doesn't run the redis instances on localhost, I had to modify the tests slightly to allow the hostnames / ports of redis instances to be passed in. I kept the defaults the same though, so everything will still work under Vagrant as normal.\r\n\r\nNote that currently the first `envy up` may take a few minutes, because envy needs to manually install all the python versions that your tox tests demand. This process can be sped up by uploading a base image that already contains the python versions that you need, or using an existing image like [this one](https://hub.docker.com/r/shimizukawa/python-all).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know what you think!",

    "body": "This removes `__del__` methods. Now, mishandled resource management will emit a `ResourceWarning`. These warnings should not be ignored. They highlight code that are not closing resources explicitly nor deterministically. Library users should use `.close()`, `.disconnect()` or\r\ncontext managers to resolve these warnings.\r\n\r\nThis follows the Python semantics of resources such as file objects and sockets. For example:\r\n\r\n    $ python3 -W always\r\n    >>> f = open('/tmp/foo', 'w')\r\n    >>> del f\r\n    __main__:1: ResourceWarning: unclosed file <_io.TextIOWrapper name='/tmp/foo' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>\r\n    ResourceWarning: Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback\r\n\r\nEven with these warnings, the resources are still closed by Python when their reference count goes to zero, but now library users can notice the mishandling and fix it.\r\n\r\nThe previous use of `__del__` comes with a number of warnings. For example, CPython does not guarantee `__del__` is called on exit:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__\r\n\r\n> It is not guaranteed that `__del__()` methods are called for objects that still exist when the interpreter exits.\r\n\r\nThere are other warnings with using `__del__()`:\r\n\r\n> Warning\r\n>\r\n> Due to the precarious circumstances under which `__del__()` methods are invoked, exceptions that occur during their execution are ignored, and a warning is printed to sys.stderr instead. In particular:\r\n>\r\n> `__del__()` can be invoked when arbitrary code is being executed, including from any arbitrary thread. If `__del__()` needs to take a lock or invoke any other blocking resource, it may deadlock as the resource may already be taken by the code that gets interrupted to execute `__del__()`.\r\n>\r\n> `__del__()` can be executed during interpreter shutdown. As a consequence, the global variables it needs to access (including other modules) may already have been deleted or set to `None`. Python guarantees that globals whose name begins with a single underscore are deleted from their module before other globals are deleted; if no other references to such globals exist, this may help in assuring that imported modules are still available at the time when the `__del__()` method is called.\r\n\r\nAll warnings emitted during tests have been cleaned up.\r\n\r\n### Pull Request check-list\r\n\r\n_Please make sure to review and check all of these items:_\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `$ tox` pass with this change (including linting)?\r\n- [x] Does travis tests pass with this change (enable it first in your forked repo and wait for the travis build to finish)?\r\n- [x] Is the new or changed code fully tested?\r\n- [ ] Is a documentation update included (if this change modifies existing APIs, or introduces new ones)?\r\n",

Now redis-py looks like it discriminates a little more on what can be encoded.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThis pull request will add a hook for objects to define their own `to_bytes` method, which will allow themselves to convert into a data type otherwise supported by the `Encoder`.  It seems to me that you can either use the built-in `__str__` method of an object or use a custom method to convert to a supported datatype.  The former might be a little too aggressive in converting data types into strings, since most objects have a `__str__` method and we would lose the ability to discriminate against unknown objects.  This implementation forces custom objects to fulfill a contract, where they will reduce themselves into an appropriate data type when `to_bytes` is called.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI added a test to exercise encoding a custom object.  The test fails before 792b77d is applied and passes afterwards.\r\n",

From a user point of view, it would be nice if these commands simply returned an empty value when called with 0 keys. For example, `MGET` could return an empty list and `DEL` could return 0 indicating 0 keys were deleted. However, commands cannot simply return an empty value because of how they interact with pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a well named option `EMPTY_ERROR`. If a command detects one of these 0-key scenarios, it can pass the `EMPTY_ERROR` option with the default value that should be returned to the application. This includes the plumbing to work with pipelines.\r\n\r\nCurrently only `MGET` is implemented as an example.

Some of our uses of pubsub are very sparse - publishers could potentially only publish every 3 days. We find, in about 1 out of 20 instances where this happens, that subscribers \"stop listening\" to a channel. Inspecting the local network we can see the channels are open but inspecting redis, it no longer is aware of these subscribers. Our hypothesis on this is that the connection has failed but since these instances of PubSub only subscribe and listen, nothing triggers the \"reconnect\" mechanism (and so `PubSub.on_connect` is never called). Redis recently (v3) implemented PINGs whilst subscribed which would give us the ability to routinely check the connection is still alive and reconnect if needed.",

We ran into these issues (many connections in CLOSE_WAIT state, and too many open connections following a load spike).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I modified `ConnectionPool.get_connection()` so that it retrieves the connection at the head of the list of available connections. `release()` still appends to the tail, so all connections will be utilized in round-robin fashion. This change was made to support the other change to `get_connection()` which verifies a connection's \"liveness\". If a connection is not live, it is disconnected, and the next available is similarly tested. If no connections are usable, then a new one is created.\r\n\r\nI also modified the `Connection.disconnect()` method so that if `shutdown()` errors (due to CLOSE_WAIT or other socket state) `close()` will still be called. I am not sure this is necessary, but I figured it was safer to ensure close is always called before the reference to the socket is deleted by setting `self._sock = None`.",

This is guaranteed to fail, and results in unnecessary round-trips to the server. We were seeing a lot of useless network traffic in our deployment because of this. The workaround is to manually set the `sha` attribute after initializing each `Script`, but this is not a very clean solution.\r\n\r\nThis change makes `Script` precalculate the SHA1 of of the script string, so that in the case where it is called on a connection to a server where the script is already registered, it saves itself an `EVALSHA` call and a `SCRIPT LOAD` call.\r\n\r\nIt also modifies the way `Script` interacts with `BasePipeline`. Previously, the `Script` would call `script_load_for_pipeline` prior to executing, which would call `SCRIPT LOAD` if the `Script.sha` was empty. That condition will never be `True` anymore, plus it is unnecessary because the pipeline calls `load_scripts` during `execute`. I removed that method and made `Script` directly add itself to the pipeline's `scripts` set so that the pipeline will register it during `load_scripts`.\r\n\r\nI know there is already a PR for this same issue, but its approach is not quite right in my opinion, and it has been inactive since 2015.",

    "body": "This PR attempts to address the namespace support being requested in [this issue](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/issues/12).\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\nSee the added section in the `README`\r\n\r\n**Implementation**\r\nBased on the suggestion by @AngusP namespacing is initiated by initializing your Redis instance with functions passed to the `add_namespace` and `rm_namespace` arguments.  Whenever a namespace is to be added/removed to/from a key the passed function will run with the key as the argument.  This gives the user control of the namespacing logic.\r\n\r\nDetecting which arguments/responses are keys follows the suggestion by @andymccurdy of using a `keys_at` method being passed to the `execute_command` argument.  For each method an array of integers representing indexes of the args passed to `execute_command` is passed as a `keys_at` kwarg.\r\n\r\nNamespace removal of responses from method's that return keys is handled by passing the provided `rm_namespace` function to the `execute_command` function who in turn passes it down to the `RESPONSE_CALLBACK` for that command, which handles the logic for namespace removal.\r\n\r\nNo state is maintained on the class instance, so as long as the user doesn't change the `add_namespace` and `rm_namespace` methods namespacing should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nDuplicates of tests without namespacing are created and run with namespacing enabled using basic add and rm namespace functions.  There are tests for namespaced redis, pipelines, pubsubs, and luascripting.\r\n\r\nThese tests ensure that the keys_at param for each method has an accurate value passed, and that when namespaces are removed from responses they are accurate.  But...\r\nI know Andy is cognizant of the time it takes to run tests, and these extra functions add a lot of increased test time.   So I am open to ideas for less strenuous testing, that still ensures good coverage but decreases test time.\r\n\r\n**Performance**\r\n\r\nI did a rudimentary performance test which produced the following results.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: import time\r\n\r\nIn [2]: import redis\r\n\r\nIn [3]: def add_namespace(key):\r\n    return 'ns:' + key\r\n   ...:\r\n\r\nIn [4]: def rm_namespace(key):\r\n    return key[3:]\r\n   ...:\r\n\r\nIn [5]: r = redis.Redis()\r\n\r\nIn [6]: nsr = redis.Redis(add_namespace=add_namespace, rm_namespace=rm_namespace)\r\n\r\nIn [7]: def test(client, num):\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(num):\r\n        _ = client.get('foo')\r\n    return time.time() - start\r\n   ...:\r\n\r\nIn [8]: test(r, 10000)\r\nOut[8]: 9.901349067687988\r\n\r\nIn [9]: test(nsr, 10000)\r\nOut[9]: 9.509238958358765\r\n\r\nIn [10]: def test(client, num):\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(num):\r\n        _ = client.zadd('zfoo', a=1, b=2, c=3)\r\n    return time.time() - start\r\n   ....:\r\n\r\nIn [11]: test(r, 10000)\r\n\r\nOut[11]: 3.7034590244293213\r\n\r\nIn [12]:\r\n\r\nIn [12]: test(nsr, 10000)\r\nOut[12]: 4.358672142028809\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

There were a couple of behavior changes required to fully fix it, so I wanted to get your feedback on my approach.\n\n1) The `socket.shutdown()` call in Connection.disconnect() wasn't safe if the process was forked and the child process inherited the file descriptor. Since the `shutdown()` call is desirable for faster cleanup in the non-forked case, I added a new `fork_safe` option to `Connection.__init__()` that let's the code do the safe thing by default or take advantage of faster socket cleanup in a non-forked environment.\n\nThat also allowed us to skip doing anything in `_checkpid()` if we know the process isn't forked.\n\n2) The other change fixes `ConnectionPool.disconnect()` so it doesn't rip connections that are in-use out from under the threads that own them. I use a generation counter to flush connections safely.\n\nA side-effect of this is that `ConnectionPool.disconnect()` doesn't actually disconnect anything immediately. Connections are disconnected gradually. I added an option to force the old behavior of \"damn the torpedoes!\" killing all connections, but the default is the safe path.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n",

To speed things up, I've implemented a cache of Token objects and modified the Token object to store its encoded value. This greatly reduces the number of times redis commands need to be encoded. It also reduces the number of times Token objects are created, although that has a smaller impact.\n\nI also wrote a basic benchmark (basic_operations.py) modeled on redis-benchmark (although much more limited). It tests the performance of some of the basic commands.\n\n```\nusage: basic_operations.py [-h] [-n] [-P] [-s]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n  -n         Total number of requests (default 100000)\n  -P         Pipeline <numreq> requests.

Similarly, `SocketBuffer._read_from_socket` (and similar) perform poor exception handling, and don't check for errors like `EINTR` that may happen at any time during a system call if the process has signal handlers set up. The proper handling of `EINTR` is to retry the system call, which Python 3.5 already does (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475/), but we need to do this in client code for older versions of Python.\n### How to reproduce\n\nRun the following script:\n\n```\nimport redis\nimport os\nimport signal\n\nprint 'PID', os.getpid()\n\nconn = redis.Redis()\n\ndef h(*args, **kwargs):\n    print 'signal handler', args, kwargs\n\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGINT, h)\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, h)\n\nconn.delete('x')\nfor x in range(1000000):\n    conn.lpush('x', x)\n```\n\nIn a separate shell, execute `kill PID` several times, where PID is the PID of the script above. Then, execute `kill -9 PID` to kill the script. When you verify the length of 'x', you will see that it most likely won't match up with the number that was pushed since the list now contains duplicate items.\n",

Please take a look a see if it belongs in the library. \n\nIt is a BatchedPipeline object that takes a batch_size argument and then executes all buffered commands after the user has added that many commands. I find it useful when executing large number of commands that I want to gain the speed of pipeline without swamping the server with one huge pipelined set of commands at the end. Or without have to keep track.\n\nI found myself writing lots of code like this:\n\n``` py\npipe = r.pipline()\n\nfor i, item enumerate(huge_iter):\n    if i % 10000 == 0:\n        pipe.execute()\n    pipe.set(i, item)\npipe.execute()\n```\n\nWith the BatchedPipeline you can use a context manager to achieve the same thing:\n\n``` py\nwith r.batched_pipeline(10000) as pipe:\n    for i, item enumerate(huge_iter):\n        pipe.set(i, item)\n```\n### How did it get fixed / implemented ?\n\nI subclassed `BasePipeline` overriding `__init__`, `pipeline_execute_command` and `__exit__`\n### How can someone test / see it ?\n\nI have duplicated all existing pipeline tests with the new class and added two new ones to test the context manager and normal use. I'm sure I could get away with not duplicating all the test by using some py.test parameterize fu. But wanted see if this was of interest.\n\nI wanted to see if this is of interest before I add the docs and clean up the doc strings. So this is not ready to go as is.\n\nSpecifically what needs to be done is docs, de-dupe test and doc strings.\n\nHere is a cute animal picture for your troubles...\n![pandas](http://data2.whicdn.com/images/26882767/large.gif)\n",

Once all data has been spooled from the socket, the last 2 bytes will be the last two bytes sent from redis, regardless of byte packing.\n\nYou'll see sizing as follows\n- len 2 - first socket read\n- len 3 - last socket read is split (CR LF were split across reads, but preserved in tail)\n- len 4 - secondary socket reads (CR LF are packed together)\n",

Understandably the forward slash in this example URL causes it to be parsed incorrectly, but even if a client attempts to percent-encode their URL (e.g. `rediss://:my%2Fpassword@localhost:6379`) this will not fix the problem since `from_url` will not know to decode the password after the URL is parsed.\n\nThis commit attempts to fix the problem by introducing a new argument, `decode_components`, to `from_url` that allows URL components to be decoded after the URL has been parsed. I used a flag here because existing clients might be relying on the current behavior.\n\nI added some unit tests and verified that they pass with python2 and python3.\n\nThis fixes issue #579 \n\nThanks,\nPaul\n",

When building the message it converts everything to unicode. The problem: This can fail as one or more parts might not be proper unicode. In our case this is due to using msgpack. That means that building the exception causes an exception (UnicodeEncodeError), hiding the original redis error.\n\nThe change I propose is to relax the unicode conversion by using a safe approach to convert the string. That fixes the UnicodeEncodeError which in turn gives me the real error message and the right exception (ResponseError).\n\nPlease have a look at the unit test, which shall document it better than my explanation above.\n\nI tested both python2 and python3 (as you will see, there is basically no change for python3)\n\nHendrik\n",

This object is then used to perform operations against the current Redis master. When the object falls out of scope (i.e. its reference count falls to zero) it is freed by Python.\n\nHowever `master` contains also a `SentinelConnectionPool` object (the one holding the connections to the sentinel). Apparently this object persists even after falling out of scope, and as a result its socket connections to the Redis server remain open.  The cause is this self-reference:\n\n```\n    self.connection_kwargs['connection_pool'] = self\n```\n\nwhich does not let the reference count drop to 0. Theoretically the Python GC detects such cycles and is able to remove objects which do not have outside references (given that `SentinelConnectionPool` does not contain a `__del__` method) . But in a long standing process (server-side) I have observed a continuous increase in open connections as `Sentinel` objects get created and drop out of scope.\n\nThe use of a weak reference solves this problem:\n\n```\n    self.connection_kwargs['connection_pool'] = weakref.proxy(self)\n```\n\nwith no apparent side-effects.\n\nPS Of course ideally objects such as `SentinelConnectionPool` should be kept and reused, and this would alleviate the problem. Still, having the safeguard mechanism of a weak reference seems advisable.\n",

    "body": "I made some changes to the way locking is currently implemented. The lock() function used to return just True or False, which left it impossible to examine the created lock object (i.e. if you wanted to see how long it's acquired for). It was also impossible to specify blocking in the lock function. Both of these are fixed without breaking previous behavior. This makes things much easier to use with Python's with statement, for example:\n\n```\nwith r.lock('foo', timeout=10000000) as lock:\n    print lock.acquired_until\n```\n\nIn addition to this, I've added the extendLock function, which let's the user extend an already existent Lock, assuming he hasn't run out of time on it. This is useful if you want some script to continuously renew a lock as long as it's using it, but make sure the lock expires in a reasonable amount of time if the box the script is on dies. Example usage:\n\n```\nwith r.lock('foo', timeout=10000) as lock:\n    while True:\n        #do stuff here\n        lock.extendLock(10000)\n```\n\nIn the above example, some box can maintain a lock and constantly do some action, but if it suddenly dies, or loses network connectivity, a new box will automatically take over for it after 10000 without us needing to manually or programmatically reset a lock with no timeout. \n",

The fix is to parse responses after each pub/sub call:\n\n``` python\nclient = Redis()\npubsub = client.pubsub()\npubsub.subscribe('foo')\npubsub.parse_response()\n# [...]\npubsub.unsubscribe('foo')\npubsub.parse_response()\npubsub.subscribe('bar')\npubsub.parse_response()\nfor message in pubsub.listen():\n    pass\n```\n\nThis is a bit cumbersome, but the real problem is that an unnecessary Redis disconnect/connect cycle is made.

For me, it runs all test cases both on Python and Python3 (except one about ZADD, but that fails on master too).\nI hope this can be helpful.\n\nGreetings,\nJulian\n",

    "body": "Hi Andy,\n\nThis changeset uses hiredis for protocol parsing when it can be imported. Otherwise, it falls back to the original way to parse replies. I've extract the ConnectionPool and Connection classes to a separate file in the process. Clearly, installing hiredis should be optional because it's a C-ext. However, when users have a proper build env, it would be cool if they can benefit from faster reply parsing. I've done some minor benchmarks, that show huge improvement for large multi bulks (see: http://github.com/pietern/hiredis-py). This patchset is only a suggestion (I created it to properly benchmark the impact of using hiredis), and we could discuss for a bit if this is the right approach.\n\nThanks!\nPieter\n",

For\nother applications, though, logging commands and connection events can provide\ninvaluable information when debugging. In my tests, adding the logging\nstatements without configuring a logger did not add any appreciable time to run\nthe full test suite.\n\nIn order to cleanly implement logging, I had to make a slight adjustment to the\nsignature of the `_execute_*` methods (which I assume to be private). If you're\nuncomfortable with this change, I'd be happy to fall back on something a little\nmore awkward but less invasive.\n\nThanks!\n",
