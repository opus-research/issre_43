      "Nice, thanks for giving this a go Sudhanshu!\r\n\r\nSo far, we use the [StandardJS code style](https://standardjs.com/), and I would like to stay close to that and introduce as little exceptions to that as possible. \r\n\r\nSome feedback points:\r\n\r\n1. I prefer to keep the code without semicolons at the end of each line, according to StandardJS (rule `semi`)\r\n2. I prefer to keep the spaces before function paren, according to StandardJS (rule `space-before-function-paren`). It is not my personal preference but it is not that important and I would like to stick to a standard).\r\n3. About no-console: that is a good one, though right now we have a couple of occurrences of `console.warn` which are intentional. And in the unit tests they actually come in handy. I would like to prevent needing a lot of `eslint-disable-line`. Any ideas what is handy in this case?\r\n4. The \"Unnecessary 'else' after 'return'\" warnings can be very helpful. We have to look in the individual cases though to understand them and fix them.",
      "\r\nRegarding feedback number 3, there's a special rule already available in ESLint called  `'no-console': ['error', { allow: ['warn'] }]`. This rule is configured to raise an ESLint error whenever there's a console statement, except for `console.warn()`.\r\n\r\nAfter you feedback I reach to this point\r\n ```\r\n rules: {\r\nindent: ['error', 2, { SwitchCase: 1 }],\r\nquotes: ['error', 'single', { avoidEscape: true }],\r\n'comma-spacing': 'error',\r\n'object-curly-spacing': ['error', 'always'],\r\n'no-console': ['error', { allow: ['warn'] }],\r\n'no-unused-vars': ['error', { args: 'after-used', ignoreRestSiblings: true }],\r\n'no-empty-function': 'error',\r\n'brace-style': ['error', '1tbs', { allowSingleLine: true }],\r\n'keyword-spacing': 'error',\r\n'spaced-comment': ['error', 'always'],\r\n'no-else-return': 'error'\r\n } \r\n```",
      "That looks good!\r\n\r\nI think we can replace the `console.log` cases in the tests with `console.warn`. Then, I see cases of unused variables, that is straightforward to fix. The  \"Unnecessary 'else' after 'return'\" cases require some attention. The empty functions in the tests can be fixed by adding for example ` /* noop */` in the function body.\r\n\r\nCan you help work out fixes?",
      "Yeah, I'm ready! Please describe the tasks that need to be done.",
      "> Please describe the tasks that need to be done.\r\n\r\nThanks. First: update the eslint config wiht your latest proposal (https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/3187#issuecomment-2064985086). Then, run `npm run lint`, and try fix as many issues as possible (start with the easiest ones like unused variables). If there are cases where you are not sure what the best way to fix an issue is, please drop a message here so we can discuss it."

I don't see failing tests related to `rotationMatrix` though, I see 4 tests for `eigs` failing?\r\n2. I expect more tests to fail as soon as we update all places where `nearlyEqual(...)` is invoked to pass both `relTol` and `absTol`.\r\n3. I think we may need to add some additional unit tests to test `relTol` and `absTol` individually.\r\n4. We should decide upon good default values `relTol` and `absTol`, and how we map values for both when a user configures `epsilon` (for backward compatibility). Would it make sense to default to `relTol = epsilon ?? 1e-12` and `absTol = epsilon ?? 1e-12`?\r\n5. In general I like to use full words rather than abbreviations, like `relativeTolerance` and `absoluteTolerance`. However in this case the words are quite long. Still thinking about that.\r\n6. I see the tests where run on node.js 16, I don't understand why, it should only run node 18 and 20 ([see config](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/develop/.github/workflows/build.yaml#L16))?

I see on the julia docs for [isaprox](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/math/#Base.isapprox) some ways to calculate those default values.\r\n5. I agree these names don't match mathjs very well just took the python names and got a warning related to the camel case. I'm sure there are more appropriate names.

I think we have to adjust the failing `nearlyEqual` tests. This will be a breaking change, and I suppose the failing tests are due to the behavior now being different, so the tests should be adapted accordingly. (please correct me if I'm wrong)\r\n3.

There is one that might be debatable that says `nearlyEqual: should do exact comparison when epsilon is null or undefined`. In my opinion it should `resort to default values of relTol and absTol when they are null or undefined`\r\n3. **OK:** Will make a separate discussion.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely!

    "body": "Fixes #3143.\r\n\r\nThe issue was that in `OperatorNode`, we didn't use `createSubScope` in case of `rawArgs` functions, like we do in `FunctionNode`.\r\n\r\nThis is needed because during evaluation of a custom defined function, we have two scopes: \r\n\r\n- \"scope\" holding the \"global\" scope variables, the values provided via `math.evaluate('...', scope)`\r\n- \"args\" holding the local function arguments of a function, like `x` in function `f(x) = fawFunction(x)^2`\r\n\r\nWhen using a `rawArgs` function, these two scopes where merged into one using `createSubScope`. Without it, you get an error like \"undefined symbol x\". However,  `createSubScope` copied all variables from both scopes in a new Map, which made it impossible to do assignments like `(a = true) and (b = true)`, because the assigned variables would end up in the subscope instead of the main scope.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this by utilizing a new wrapper `Map` instance, named `PartitionedMap`. It holds references to both `scope` and `args`. It looks and acts like a normal Map, but it keeps the two scopes separated under the hood, and hence can read/write to the right scope.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, we're now not copying the scope anymore inside `createSubScope`, we only instantiate a wrapper interface around it. This improves the performance of custom defined functions 🚀.",

Now it's all gone, and I'm not entirely sure if it's even possible to fix it.\r\n\r\nCould we somehow restore support for custom scopes with custom methods instead of passing around this PartitionedMap?",
      "I'm sorry to hear that Piotr. Can you share a minimal example of the kind of logic that you're using and that now doesn't work anymore?",
      "@josdejong, thanks! I'll think about a minimal example tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI actually managed to fix it on our side, as our custom Scope was still accessible as the `.a` property of the new PartitionedMap. However, I probably need to test it a bit more to ensure that our original custom scope doesn't eventually get lost. Previously, I wasn't worried about this, as our custom MathJS scope was implementing the expected interface, including:\r\n```javascript\r\n  createSubScope() {\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it seems to be available as the `.a` property, but I suspect that if `createSubScope()` from src/utils/map.js is called a few times, `.a` might eventually reference another PartitionedMap.\r\n\r\nEssentially, we're implementing an app with formula support, similar to a very simple spreadsheet. We rely heavily on the custom MathJS scope that exposes custom methods necessary for app-specific calculations.\r\n\r\nWe used to define our formula functions as:\r\n```javascript\r\nsomeFunction: {\r\n    evaluateRaw: (args: MathNode[], mathjs: any, scope: CustomMathJSScope) => {\r\n      scope.customMethod()\r\n      // ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nbut now they looks more like:\r\n```javascript\r\nsomeFunction: {\r\n    evaluateRaw: (args: MathNode[], mathjs: any, partitionedScope: { a: CustomMathJSScope }) => {\r\n      const scope = partitionedScope.a;\r\n      scope.customMethod()\r\n      // ...\r\n    }\r\n```",
      "@josdejong, here's a minimal working example that uses MathJS v12.3.1:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/0arxye24/\r\n\r\nThe idea is to use a custom Scope class that provides `.customMethod()`. This used to be possible because we could control how the sub-scopes are created via `.createSubScope()`. In this particular example, scope is just returning itself, but it could clone itself properly. Our scope is never wrapped in some MathJS class.\r\n\r\nI based that implementation on the fact that the official documentation described scope as an object that implements the Map interface, and also on this example (which seems to be outdated now, btw):\r\nhttps://mathjs.org/examples/advanced/custom_scope_objects.js.html\r\n\r\nI believe it would be great to still be able to provide a custom Scope implementation (even if it needs to implement this partitioning) and control how the sub-scopes are created, as in previous implementations.\r\n ",
      "> I actually managed to fix it on our side\r\n\r\nThat is good news!\r\n\r\nIn general: there _should_ be no need to do things using `const scope = partitionedScope.a`, and doing that can introduce weird issues. Instead, you can get the function out of it using a getter: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nsomeFunction: {\r\n  evaluateRaw: (args: MathNode[], mathjs: any, scope: CustomMathJSScope) => {\r\n    // formerly scope was an Object: \r\n    //     scope.customMethod()\r\n    // now, it is a Map:\r\n    const customMethod = partitionedScope.get('customMethod')\r\n    customMethod()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",

Looking into that I see that you extend the Map interface, that may indeed give difficulties when the Map internally is wrapped by another Map interface. \r\n\r\nIsn't it possible to put your `customMethod` as a regular value in the Map instead? like `myMap.put('customMethod', ...)`",

Here's the custom scope that I'm talking about: https://github.com/concord-consortium/codap/blob/8e7fc861af3d29502d7bf23f678d05cf93c262c2/v3/src/models/formula/formula-mathjs-scope.ts\r\n\r\nSo, I'm not sure what to do with all the custom functionality implemented in this class.",

      "> Thanks for sharing this class with your code. I will try to understand why createSubScope is and attaching custom methods to a Map interface is needed in the first place. We may come up with a different solution for your case.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nI think the general concept is that a simple `Map` works for basic math evaluation. However, if you want dynamic evaluation of saved math expressions (like in a spreadsheet), the custom scope object is a powerful concept that can provide that functionality.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think it would be great if we could officially support these custom scopes in MathJS. This would require two things:\r\n- Custom Scope needs to implement whatever MathJS needs (e.g., Map interface + partitioning + whatever else in the future). This could be easily controlled by TypeScript interface.\r\n- Custom Scope needs to control how it's cloned when a subscope is necessary. This ensures it can return itself or clone properly, ensuring that other code always works with one class (rather than some MathJS wrapper).\r\n\r\n> A minimal usage example would help me understand what we're talking about. Do you have any?\r\n\r\nI think this JSFiddle is the best, minimal example I can think of. Of course, it's not very useful by itself.\r\n\r\nIn a real-life scenario, think about a spreadsheet where formulas are evaluated using MathJS. Some of the custom functions might modify what `scope.get(\"someKey\")` returns during a single expression evaluation (e.g., providing some cached values). Some complex behaviors would be difficult to achieve with regular, basic maps used as scopes.",
      "Can you explain what the need is to pass these custom methods, attached to the Map interface, towards a \"someFunction\"?\r\n\r\ni.e. isn't it possible to do something like the following?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst context = {\r\n  customMethod: () => { ... }\r\n}\r\n\r\nsomeFunction: {\r\n  evaluateRaw: (args: MathNode[], mathjs: any, partitionedScope: { a: CustomMathJSScope }) => {\r\n    context.customMethod()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr is this `customMethod` dynamic or so?",
      "It's hard to explain all that in isolation.\r\n\r\nBut maybe I can give another, simpler example - even our `.get(key)` method is way more complex than regular Map.get():\r\nhttps://github.com/concord-consortium/codap/blob/8e7fc861af3d29502d7bf23f678d05cf93c262c2/v3/src/models/formula/formula-mathjs-scope.ts#L62-L110\r\n\r\nWe do not want to pre-populate Map instance with all possible key-values, as this would be a huge performance hit and generally not reasonable in our scenario. So, our custom `.get()` method looks for the required key and calculates value lazily (and then caches it). This is not something we can do with regular Map.\r\n",
      "But that complexity is nicely contained inside the Map implementation behind the regular `.get()` method, right? \r\n\r\nI think the core of the issue is that you want to attach and invoke custom methods on a `Map` interface, like `scope.customMethod()`. Then the question is, is there an alternative way to provide the function where you need to invoke these custom methods? ie. pass a context with these custom methods to your custom `someFunction`. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: and my second question is: why are these custom methods needed in the first place, why isn't the Map interface with get/set enough?

So, it all depends on whether we're pretending to be a Map (and MathJS thinks it's a native Map that can be wrapped in another Map or class) or if we're explicitly allowed to use a custom class implementing the Map interface and MathJS respects that.\r\n\r\n> Then the question is, is there an alternative way to provide the function where you need to invoke these custom methods? ie. pass a context with these custom methods to your custom someFunction.\r\n\r\nThis is difficult for me to answer without spending some significant time on refactoring. I bet it's possible (as almost everything is possible :wink:), but it's probably not pretty. Since the formulas are evaluated like:\r\n```javascript\r\n  const compiledFormula = math.compile(formula)\r\n  const result = compiledFormula.evaluate(scope)\r\n```\r\nand custom functions are defined in a clean, stateless way:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst customFunction = (args, mathjs, scope) => { ... }\r\n```\r\nI don't see a better place for custom functionality than this custom scope, as that's the only context that we actually control. Setting a module or global variable isn't a pretty approach, even though it could work. Another non-pretty approach would be to do `scope.set(\"objectWithCustomMethods\", objectWithCustomMethods)` and then get it inside the function. So surely there are ways. But not necessarily ones that I'd like to use. But I'd need to think about it more. It's a bit difficult for me atm too, as I cannot spend more time on such experiments and refactoring on our side.\r\n\r\n> and my second question is: why are these custom methods needed in the first place, why isn't the Map interface with get/set enough? (I'm not criticizing or anything but just trying to understand the use case😅 )\r\n\r\nImagine our custom scope has two methods: `scope.enableCaching()` and `scope.disableCaching()`. These methods toggle a flag that affects how `scope.get()` works. Achieving this is difficult when working with an object limited to the Map interface and a separate object with custom methods. While we could do `scope.set(\"__secret_key__cachingEnabled\", true)`, this is not a long-term solution. I would rather explore other options than be forced to implement most of the functionality in this way.\r\n\r\n",
      "> Assuming that my custom Map is allowed (as the documentation changed from scope: Object to scope: Map) and it will always be maintained at the top of the map hierarchy, and MathJS never assumes it's a regular Map and e.g. tries to clone it, then yes, you're right.\r\n\r\nThat is indeed the case: mathjs does not clone or copy the `scope`, it only wraps around it to add a sub-scope on top of it for keeping say the variable `x` in a custom defined function `f(x) = x^2` when executing this function.  The old implementation indeed copied all variables into a new Map instance, and it did call `parentScope.createSubScope()` for that, but that is now not needed anymore. \r\n\r\nThanks for your explanation about the context, I think you're right, it sounds like the most logic way to pass context to your custom function (I expect the alternative would require jumping though hoops).\r\n\r\n> Imagine our custom scope has two methods: `scope.enableCaching()` and `scope.disableCaching()`. These methods toggle a flag that affects how `scope.get()` works.\r\n\r\nThanks, this helps me a lot understanding the case 😅 👍 . This makes sense indeed, it is very neat to keep these custom funcions are stateless/standalone. I also agree that using something like `scope.set(\"__secret_key__cachingEnabled\", true)` is ugly.\r\n\r\nSo, understanding your use case now and thinking about a solution, I think [your earlier solution](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/3150#issuecomment-2245886814) will indeed work perfectly fine. It would be good though to write a (recursive) helper function for this I think to make it more robust, something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// usage:\r\nsomeFunction: {\r\n    evaluateRaw: (args: MathNode[], mathjs: any, scope: Map | PartitionedMap) => {\r\n      const rootScope = getRootScope(scope);\r\n      rootScope.customMethod()\r\n      // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getRootScope(scope) {\r\n  return isPartitionedMap(scope)\r\n    ? getRootScope(scope.a) // recurse\r\n    : scope\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction isPartitionedMap(map) {\r\n  return isMap(map) && isMap(map.a) && isMap(map.b)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction isMap(map) {\r\n  // ... check existence of methods get, set, has, etc...\r\n}\r\n```",
      "Thanks! This recursive approach gives me peace of mind, as it should indeed be safe. Things seemed to work even without it, but I was worried that at some point, our custom scope would be buried too deep and we wouldn't find it at the `.a` property.\r\n\r\nThis seems safe enough for us to move forward. However, I wonder if we're still in some gray, undocumented area, and if these interfaces shouldn't be documented somewhere. I could imagine adding a few words about this in the documentation, and maybe the `.a` and `.b` names could be more descriptive, or there could be some design that hides these details from use cases like ours. But obviously, this doesn't need to happen now, just something to think about long-term.\r\n\r\nActually, one of the easiest approaches could be MathJS exporting `getRootScope` itself and ensuring it always works. This way, we wouldn't need to worry about what kind of scope we're currently dealing with, and no one would be locked into the current implementation with `.a` and `.b` properties (or whatever they become in the future).\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for all the responses!",
      "Sounds good 💪 \r\n\r\nI'll write about this in the docs, add unit tests that verify that the passed `scope` always is a `Map` or `PartitionedMap`, update the example `custom_scope_objects.js`, and see whether I can export at least helper functions `isMap` and `isPartitionedMap`.\r\n\r\nI'll give a refactoring of the `PartitionedMap` some more thought too, maybe expose two getters for the two internal maps but it is indeed not the biggest concern right now.\r\n\r\nFor your solution: I would also add an extra check in the code to verify whether `getRootScope()` indeed returned a `FormulaMathJsScope` instance, and if not throw an exception that you can capture in unit tests. That should guard against a new type of Map instance is added in the future that requires a different way to get to the root scope (I can't think of anything in that direction but you never know)."

Functions which cannot determine the type of output from the input (for example math.evaluate) use the default number type, which can be configured when instantiating math.js\"\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### This leads to extremely poor performance when people try to use mathjs:\r\n- Rendering 1000 hyper-cubes rotated around 2 axis using vanilla mathjs, no explicit numeric types (slow & avgs ~40ms/frame on my machine): https://editor.p5js.org/PotatoBoy/sketches/uPZZwvhgC\r\n\r\n### Which wouldn't exist had these explicit numeric types been used:\r\n- Rendering 1000 hyper-cubes rotated around 2 axis using vanilla mathjs with explicit numeric types (fast & avgs ~1-2ms/frame on my machine): https://editor.p5js.org/PotatoBoy/sketches/DsDHNojgz\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n# Why this wasn't done before now and how this PR fixes the issue that caused it\r\n\r\n### It seems like adding type inferencing was previously considered, but then ignored because of an issue with changing element types:\r\n- Issue: https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/1709\r\n- Issue's issue: https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/1709#issuecomment-590008781\r\n\r\n### This PR fixes this by getting the type during the tensor operation itself\r\n- `<tensor>.getDataType()` is called to infer the datatype if it wasn't explicitly defined\r\n- While getting inferring the type every operation may seem slow, compared to the alternative of using the generic function, it's much much faster as seen by the previous examples and the solution's example and is well worth it for the performance.\r\n- The datatype of the generated tensor using the inferred datatype is changed right before returning it, but not for the instantiation parameter in order to future-proof it in case future optimized methods of loading tensor data are used so that they can be used for the operation. \r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n# The Solution this PR provides\r\n\r\n### Type inferencing boosts the performance to speeds nearly indistinguishable from the speeds of explicit types\r\n- Rendering 1000 hyper-cubes rotated around 2 axis using type inferencing mathjs, no explicit numeric types (fast & avgs ~1-2ms/frame on my machine): https://editor.p5js.org/PotatoBoy/sketches/01IsuOlTR\r\n\r\nLastly, I'd still recommend that the documentation more readily states and promotes the existence of these explicit types, but I'm not sure whether or not that would fit in with what mathjs is trying to go for in its documentation, and it mostly likely won't be necessary with type inferencing added so I won't be adding documentation doing that in this PR.",

      "Thanks for working out this PR @RandomGamingDev . You're right, matrix operations are way faster when there is a datatype configured in the matrix. Currently the default is to leave it undefined and assume the matrix may have mixed content, which is slow.\r\n\r\nSo, good point to see how we can address this and make the \"default\" performance better.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n\r\n- Your solution to improve `multiply` will work, but only for `multiply`, not for other matrix operations.\r\n- So, I think we should look for a more generic solution. \r\n- The most logic one is to ensure call `getArrayDataType(data)` when constructing the matrix, ensuring it always has `_datatype` defined.\r\n- This will make creating a matrix slower, and I would love to have an idea on the performance impact: how much slower matrix creation becomes compared to how much we win with typical matrix operations (multiplication, addition, etc).\r\n\r\n@gwhitney do you have any thoughts in this regard?",

This solution is already generic enough and basically the only other operations that I see that benefit from type inferencing are here:\r\n- https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/tree/develop/src/type/matrix/utils\r\n- https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/9fe4ffee5f85d52fd7f3e49abd204edffab64f94/src/function/matrix/dot.js\r\n\r\nThe type inferencing solution works for these as well. I'll add type inferencing for them as well.",
      "I could believe either  of the following could be a reasonable path forward \r\n\r\n(a) datatype be set on creation, and then any operation that would make it mixed fails unless the type is explicitly set to mixed, because we all know that 99.9% of the use is not actually mixed type; or\r\n\r\n(b) @RandomGamingDev  is right and it only matters for a handful of operations and so it's OK just to check for uniform type on every call to such operations.  \r\n\r\nConceptually, I agree with Jos that (a) is \"cleaner\" but it may not be worth the trouble. One question: if we go (b), is there a minimum size for the matrix below which it's not worth checking (because we don't get back enough performance payoff to make it worth the check? Just wondering. Maybe multiplying a mixed type matrix is just so bad that even for 2x2 matrices, it's worth checking for uniform type.",
      "> Conceptually, I agree with Jos that (a) is \"cleaner\" but it may not be worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe main issue I have with (a) is with backwards compatibility and debugging and because the `_data` parameter (despite looking like it should be private due to the prepended underscore) is modified and used directly in programs using mathjs. Changing it so that changing the types causes an error would break back-compatibility for these programs and would mean having to detect variable modifications as soon as they happen (since it sounds like you want the wrong modification of a tensor to instantly throw an error), which was the issue that stopped type inferencing from getting added in the first place and [although it appears possible using certain features of JS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41405080/how-to-detect-when-a-javascript-object-variable-is-accessed), it looks like an overly bulky and unnecessary solution to me. Because of these reasons I don't think that (a)'s choice of AOT (ahead of time) type inferencing on tensor creation would work as well as (b)'s choice of JIT (just in time) type inferencing on tensor operation.\r\n\r\n> One question: if we go (b), is there a minimum size for the matrix below which it's not worth checking (because we don't get back enough performance payoff to make it worth the check? Just wondering. Maybe multiplying a mixed type matrix is just so bad that even for 2x2 matrices, it's worth checking for uniform type.\r\n\r\nIt might not be that bad, but even for a 2x2 matrix multiplication that's still using the general function and inferring the type for every single operation, so realistically the JIT method of just checking at the start using the decently efficient `<tensor>.getDataType()` method is going to be the more efficient option unless the type is mixed, in which case the performance difference is tiny compared to the cost of using the general function to infer the type for every number of the tensor which is a change that I'd say is well worth it if it means that all other tensors without an explicit numeric type get multitudes faster and so that newcomers to the library won't get confused by the \"terrible\" performance.",

The existence of such usage shouldn't be a factor in the choice between (a) and (b). That's not saying I am pushing hard for (a) over (b); I am leaving that up to Jos, and I'd support either direction.

As you said previously, the performance has already been improved. As for improving it further, I don't see any specific way to improve the performance of matrix division with just the type inferencing in this PR.\r\n4. I've taken a look at them and added them\r\n\r\nI'd like to note that I only added type inferencing to some of the matrix algorithms in the matrix utils since some of the callbacks used alongside the algorithms that didn't have type inferencing added to them aren't typed and thus fail when type inferencing tries to assume a type.

However, after I realized that the bug also affected `round((0.145*100), 0)`, and tried unsuccessfully to correct that version of the bug, I changed gears and moved to the low level function. I will have to spend some time figuring out how your runtime type-checking and dependency injection work because my working bug fix for `number:` just threw errors when I put the same logic in for `'number, number':` when I ran the test in Mocha.\r\n\r\n> 2. Instead of `parseFloat(value).toFixed(14)` I think we can use `roundNumber` itself.\r\n> 3. I _think_ we should use a value based on `config.epsilon` instead of `14`, does that make sense?\r\n> 4. I think we also need the BigNumber implementation in function `round` to use a nearly equal comparision.\r\n\r\nI will get to work on these revisions today. Thanks again!",
      "I believe I implemented the changes you requested to this bug fix, @josdejong. Let me know if you want me to adjust anything else.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
      "I fixed the missing argument in the two regular number functions. I also converted the if...else statements to use the ternary operators as you suggested, and I feel it does make the code look much cleaner.\r\n\r\nYou also asked for unit tests to verify an edge case where a number rounded to the precision of epsilon is not nearly equal to the original number. I spent more time trying to come up with an input that could make that happen than I did making the revisions to the code, but I could not come up with anything. Admittedly, I am not a mathematician (I even had to google the spelling of mathematician, lol) I am just an aspiring software developer pretending to be good at math to work on your software. :wink: But here is the logic as I understand it:\r\n\r\nRounding a number to the precision of an epsilon value can not change the number by more than half of the epsilon, which using our default epsilon of 1e-12 would be 5e-13.  I ran a bunch of tests while watching the values calculated in nearlyEqual and the relative error that our difference is compared to was usually in the range of xe-11 as shown here using the original value from the bug report:\r\n\r\n    $ node roundtesting.js\r\n\r\n    config.epsilon 1e-12\r\n    epsilonExponent 12\r\n    x 14.499999999999998\r\n    xEpsilon 14.5\r\n\r\n    nearlyEqual relative error 1.45e-11\r\n    nearlyEqual return true\r\n\r\n    round(0.145 * 100) returns 15\r\n\r\nIf you know of an edge case, or can steer me in the right direction to figure one out, I'd be happy to add some lines to the test file for this. Otherwise, I'm content knowing that we should never actually get a false value returned from the nearlyEqual function call.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, I welcome any advice you have good or bad.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
      "> I am just an aspiring software developer pretending to be good at math \r\n\r\n:joy: I appreciate your work, thanks!\r\n\r\n> You also asked for unit tests to verify an edge case where a number rounded to the precision of epsilon is not nearly equal to the original number.\r\n\r\n\r\nThinking about it, it makes sense that we do not reach this second case of the original if/else: first we round `x` to `epsilon` digits, and next we check if the difference between the original and the rounded value is less than `epsilon`, which indeed is always the case. That is quite funny. So I guess we can simplify the code to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction (x, n) {\r\n  const xEpsilon = roundNumber(x, epsilonExponent)\r\n  return roundNumber(xEpsilon, n)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that makes sense: the first step gets rid of any round-off errors, and the second step does the rounding to the actually desired precision.\r\n\r\nI had one more thought: in case of BigNumber (defaulting to 64 digits), the user will not be able to round to say 20 digits with the default configuration of `epsilon: 1e-12`, since the 20 will be overwritten with 12. What do you think, should we add a case that calculates the applied epsilon as the max of the configured `config.epsilon` and the provided `n`?\r\n",
      "I removed the nearlyEqual comparisons and added a dynamic epsilon to the big number logic to cover cases where users asked for numbers to be rounded to a higher precision than epsilon. I then realized that the same thing could occur if a user tries to round a regular number to more than 12 decimals, so I added the dynamic epsilon there as well.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I added test cases to cover the dynamic epsilon logic and threw in some comments so others will know what the logic is for.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
      "Thanks for the updates. You're right, we have to respect the `n` argument too. Thanks for adding all tests. I made a few new inline comments, can you have a look at those?",

The first answer talks about how to resolve them being pending. However, I can see them in your screenshot so I'll get to work on them.\r\n\r\nAs far as the (n < 15) and (n < 64) comparison, the low level roundNumber function will only round to 15 decimal places so if I add one to n and it is already 15 it will cause an error. I was under the impression that big numbers were limited to 64 decimals and was making a similar verification. What *is* the max number of decimals for a big number then?\r\n\r\nRegarding the new Bignumber and toNumber() logic, that was the only way to make the unit test pass. If I did it any other way it would make other scenarios not work (I believe it was the complex number one). The logic in my head was that the original function was supposed to have a big number type as both the x and the n so I decided to give big number types to the returned function and use it as written (except for the xEplsilon part). This was the original returned funtion: \r\n\r\n``` return x.toDecimalPlaces(n.toNumber())```\r\n\r\nI can try to find another solution though, if you'd like.",
      "Yes, I can see them now",
      "Well, I have no new commits for you today. In fact, I am leaning towards recommending for you to just reject this pull request and the associated issue all together. I thought rounding to epsilon precision before rounding a number to a whole value was safe mathematically and would handle round off error. I later on thought that if someone wanted to round to a higher precision than epsilon, we could just round to one higher decimal place first, then round to what they requested. However, I have now found an edge case than breaks both of those theories.\r\n\r\nIf a user wants to round the actual number of 1.4999999999995 (13 decimal places) without specifying a number of decimal places and we round it to epsilon precision first it will round to 2 instead of 1 like it should. This example could also be changed to break any epsilon with a negative 'e' value.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the user wants ```round(0.0149999999995, 2)``` they will get 0.02 instead of 0.01.  And you can find similar examples that break our logic by moving the decimal place depending on what the user requested.\r\n\r\nWe cannot use nearly equal to compare the final rounding number or the solution wouldn't fix the example in the example posted in the issue. So, what is worse round off errors or these errors that we would induce with the fix to round off errors?",
      "> Yes, I can see them now\r\n\r\n😅 that's good to hear. Sorry, my bad. I didn't see that I was inside a review mode and that the comments where pending.\r\n\r\n> However, I have now found an edge case than breaks both of those theories.\r\n\r\nHm. Good to think this through. Isn't the thing that you can't fully represent `1.4999999999995` (13 decimal places) when you have selected epsilon to be 12 digits (the default)? That would make sense, right? Similarly, you can't represent a BigNumber with 66 digits when you've configured them to have max 64 digits?\r\n",
      "@BrianFugate I have given this some more thought. As far as I can see though there is not a problem, as long as you recon with the configured `epsilon`. If you want to support 1.4999999999995 (13 decimal places), you'll have to configure epsilon to be 1e-14 for example, then it will work, right?",
      "Hi, just a comment\r\n\r\nConfiguring `epsilon` to be 1e-14 to get 13 decimal places isn't assuming that epsilon is the absolute tolerance?\r\n\r\nPreviously I mistakenly thought that epsilon did not work. My mistake was because I thought it was absolute when currently it's relative.",
      "@dvd101x ah, you're right. Originally Brian had this construct `nearlyEqual(x, roundNumber(x, epsilonExponent), config.epsilon)` but I couldn't come up with a case where this would be false. Probably it should because `nearlyEqual` is using a relative difference. Can you come up with a case where this will return false?",
      "With this latest commit I removed the dynamic epsilon logic and made it just skip the roundoff error correction if the user requests the same or more decimals as config.epsilon has.\r\n\r\nI also added a test to the unit test file to verify that our outputs change if epsilon is changed during runtime.

Right now, when I remove the `nearlyEqual` part, only one BigNumber test fails.\r\n\r\nEDIT: sorry, I see that both number and BigNumber implementations of `round(x, n)` have a failing test without the `nearlyEqual` part. So only for the `round(x)` implementations there is no test that fails without the `nearlyEqual` section.",
      "I do not think there is a case where we can make ```round(x)``` fail the nearly equal test and here are my reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The smallest number that can be flipped to round up to 1 is 0.45 if rounded to 1 decimal first (i.e. 1e-1 epsilon)\r\n2. According to @dvd101x 's shotgun test, with a 1e-1 epsilon, 0.1 passes the nearlyEqual test and 0.01 fails it. Regardless of where the actual breakover point is between those two numbers we will always round down to 0 regardless of the nearlyEquals result.\r\n3. Using 1e0 for our epsilon is the same as removing our two stage rounding process, because we will just round to 0 decimal places twice.\r\n\r\nUnless there are plans to make the low level function ```roundNumber``` accept negative decimals (maybe for rounding to the tens or hundreds) or decimal.js doing the same for ```.toDecimals```, or you are planning on changing how ```nearlyEqual``` uses epsilon in @dvd101x 's pull request #3152, then I do not think the ```nearlyEqual``` verification is necessary for ```round(x)```. Do you want me to remove it or leave it in place just in case something else changes in the future?",
      "I think indeed that we could remove the `nearlyEqual` check in the `round(x)` signatures. We can go both ways. Your reasoning about possible future changes is a good one though. Keeping the logic the same ensures that there cannot be subtle edge-cases where the behavior differs. Also, it is easier to understand the code of `round` when it has 4x the exact same logic rather than two different implementations. \r\n\r\nOK then, let's leave it as it is right now, with 4x the same implementation, OK?",

For example, the kronecker product of two 1-by-1 matrices should be a 1-by-1 matrix, e.g. `kron([[2]],[[3]])` should be `[[6]]` -- you should check that you are getting that right. Also a 1-by-2 and a 1-by-3 should give you a 1-by-6, e.g. `kron([[1,2]],[[1,2,3]])` should be `[[1,2,3,2,4,6]]` -- that should likely get added to the tests. For symmetry, we might want to check that `kron([[1],[2]],[[1],[2],[3]])` comes out to `[[1],[2],[3],[2],[4],6]]` and do ones that go opposite directions as well: `kron([1,2], [[1],[2],[3]])` should be `[[1,2],[2,4],[3,6]]` and `kron([[1],[2]], [[1,2,3]])` should be `kron([[1,2,3], [2,4,6]])`.

      "Thanks Alex, this looks good! \r\n\r\nCan you add unit tests to test each of the 4 new prefixes?",

I think right now I can change the value of `yocto` from `1e-24` to anything, say `1`, and the unit tests will still happily pass because they do not look at the actual value that the prefix has.\r\n\r\nCodecov can be a bit picky, you don't always have to adhere to it (for example: if you have a file with 80% coverage, and you refactor a part of the code that has 100% coverage by making it shorter, the code coverage drops 😅).\r\n",
      "@josdejong , gladly! Ready for review.\r\n\r\nI'd typically separate the data and logic in such tests, like:\r\n```\r\nconst prefixes = [\r\n  { exponent: 30, long: 'quetta', short: 'Q' },\r\n  ...\r\n];\r\n\r\nit('should accept long prefixes', function () {\r\n  prefixes.forEach(({ exponent, long }) => {\r\n    assert.strictEqual(new Unit(math.bignumber(Number(`1e${exponent}`), 'meter').format(), `1 ${long}meter`)\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* Testing more prefixes is easy! Just another row in `prefixes`\r\n* Test code has to be maintained too! May as well make it easy to read :)\r\n\r\nBut, I noticed this repo doesn't usually do that, and consistency is important.\r\n\r\nSo, I defer to your judgement.

In the test suite of mathjs there are quite some tests that we could refactor. We should use a foreach loop provided by the test framework though, otherwise it can be hard to figure out from the output _which_ of the parameters is failing. And when executed by the test framework, it can run the test for each of the parameters, outputting all failing cases, instead of stopping at the first case.\r\n",

      "Hi @josdejong, thanks for your feedback. I think the build-and-test errors were down to some minor failures of some of the typescript tests due to incorrect type inferences. \r\n\r\nHowever, looking deeper into the code, I'm not actually sure any longer which functions would support n-dimensional arrays. I initially assumed that all did, but on further inspection it seems that the multiply function only supports up to matrix multiplication, i.e. does not generalise to rank n > 2 tensors. It may also be the case that other functions are assuming that arrays are always 2 or fewer dimensions, although I haven't checked this thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, supporting n-dimensional arrays is not just a matter of changing the Typescript definition, and would require checking every function to ensure they work with tensors and re-write them if not (or flag them as incompatible with n > 2 dimensions). This is obviously a much bigger task, so I'm not sure how best to proceed?\r\n\r\nI'm new to open source development and not an especially talented mathematician so please take my analysis with a grain of salt, and let me know if you think I got anything wrong in the above assessment!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nAmol",
      "That is a very good point Amolition. In general, the Matrix type and the nested Arrays can be n-dimensional in mathjs, but not all functions do support n-d matrices. In the long term, we want to auto-generate types from the source code, that should give accurate type definitions. For the time being, we still maintain the types manually. \r\n\r\nI think there are three possible scenarios here:\r\n\r\n1. Right now, the types are too conservative. When you use mathjs in TypeScript, you simply don't know that you can use n-d matrices.\r\n2. The cheapest way to improve on this is to define Matrix and Array as being n-dimensional. Only doing that will give no compile-time knowledge about whether an arbitrary function can support this or not, and only throwing a runtime error when executing that. This is similar to say `round(x: number, decimals: number)` not reflecting in the type that `decimals` must be a positive integer. Or the type of `pow(value: Matrix, exp: number)` not reflecting that the matrix must be square. Etc.\r\n3. We can go through every available function and define whether it supports n-d matrices or not. That should improve type definitions, though I think it may also introduce difficulties in that people need to do type casting to explain TS that some arbitrary array really is only 2-d and not n-d. That will be considerably more work.\r\n\r\nAt this point I think that approach (2) would be an improvement over the current situation (1). And I am not sure whether we should try out option at this moment (3), or better await auto-generating types.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

In this case: how to couple a code editor with mathjs. If the example turns into a full-fledged application, it will be hard to see the trees from the forest.\r\n \r\nWould it make sense to make the example that we include in the examples section as bare-bone as possible, and add a reference to a separate git repo with a more extensive editor there? In the separate git repo you can work out the editor in more detail (you list a couple of features that still can be included). If git repo turns out nicely, we can also add a link to in in the Extensions section: https://mathjs.org/download.html#extensions.\r\n",
      "Thanks 😄,\r\n\r\nIt makes sense,\r\n\r\nI did include some features that could be removed to simplify a bit:\r\n\r\n1. It currently separates the input into paragraphs(blocks), thus creating these chunks of results per paragraph.\r\n2. Has a delay between input and results (so that it doesn't evaluate every keystroke)\r\n3. It splits the input in lines that can be parsed together to match the output. It could be reduced significantly by just evaluating the whole input and show the whole set of results. (Also if a single expressions throws an error, the whole input would throw an error)\r\n4. Has some code that gets the examples from certain functions, it could be reduced by including a text at the beginning\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, shall some of those features be removed to be bare-bone?",
      "I think it would indeed simplify the logic related to separate blocks a bit. It would be nice to keep evaluating lines one by one because else a single line having an error would indeed make the whole output an error.\r\n\r\nThe delay between input and output makes a lot of sense, I think it is important to show that in the example.\r\n\r\nI like the autocompletion, it shows a very useful and tight integration between the code editor and mathjs.\r\n\r\nI think it would be easier to grasp what is going on when providing a static string with some initial calculations (maybe take the ones from https://mathjs.org/), instead of smartly loading them via the help examples of a list of functions.",
      "On a side note: what I would love to try out is creating a [CodeMirror decoration](https://codemirror.net/examples/decoration/) that shows the results _inline_, on the next line. I guess that would be a Widget decoration. Is that something you would like to fiddle with too?",
      "Thanks for your inputs!\r\n\r\nThe use of decoratros is something that I would be interested in implementing to get rid of the right panel.\r\n\r\nSadly I don't have much experience with **bundlers**, thus I was sticking to CodeMirror5 which doesn't have that option.\r\n\r\nIf you could point me to a way to make a simple CM6 editor the right way within this project I'm interested in migrating the CM5 logic and including the results in decorators which would be really cool.",
      "I'll give it a try and do some fiddling the end of next week, that would be fun. I have some recent experience with CodeMirror6 in a different project, so I'm not a total stranger.",

      "The experiment in https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs-codemirror is quite functional now. Showing results inline adds quite some complexity, so for this example it may be best to take your approach of showing the results in a panel on the right side instead, so we keep the example as simple as possible. So then we just copy the setup of the editor to this example and not the logic for inline results.\r\n\r\nAlso, the language definition should still be converted to CodeMirror 6 if I'm not mistaken, but I'm not sure what is involved in that and how much work it will be.",
      "Yes, the experiment is fantastic, but maybe not so easy to implement at first.\r\n\r\nRegarding the language definition with a non legacy mode I think it's a nice to have, there are many languages that have not made the transition to CodeMirror 6 including Matlab/Octave. A reference for complexity could be Julia that has this [community project](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/lang-julia) but I don't think it should stop this example.",

      "The PR looks good and well tested, thanks David. I think we can merge it as-is.\r\n\r\nAbout your discussion points:\r\n\r\n1.  Renaming `quantileSeq` to `quantile`: I don't remember why the function was originally named like this. I would prefer not \"just\" renaming the function, that is a breaking change again. But if there is a good reason for it we can consider it. Is the name `quantile` more common in other applications for example?\r\n2.  I'm not sure what you mean with `A different method could be implemented for example linear (numpy's default)`\r\n3.  Would you like to change `lastDimToZeroBased` to make it more usable in different cases? Do you have a proposal? \r\n4.  The function `quantileSeq` can indeed use some refactoring if you want to give that a go. A PR would be welcome, but let's please create a separate PR for this.\r\n5.  Yes I would love to add the dimension argument to other functions too. (let's do that in a separate PR :))\r\n6.  Definitely! You're full of ideas to improve the code base :). A separate PR with a refactor would be nice.\r\n",
      "Thank you, Jos,\r\n\r\nOk, that sounds good to have those topics on a different PRs. I think I left some unwanted modifications in the docs which I will fix soon.\r\n\r\n1. After further review, I noticed `quantileSeq` has a parameter that is not common for other `quantile`, If `probOrN` <= 1 then it is  `prob` as other `quantile` but if `probOrN` is an integer > 1 then it acts differently by splitting the range from 0 to 1 in `N` places and returning an array of `prob` and the rest works like other `quantile`. Here are some references of other `quantile` that are similar between them:\r\n  - https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/quantile\r\n  - https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.quantile.html\r\n  - https://octave.sourceforge.io/octave/function/quantile.html\r\n  - https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/quantile.html\r\n  - https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Quantile.html\r\n  - https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Statistics/#Statistics.quantile!\r\n2. In numpy there are about 9 different methods to compute `quantile`. The linear method instead of giving the average of two values when it falls in between, does a linear interpolation.\r\n3. Currently `lastDimToZeroBased` is limited to where the number of arguments is exactly two. `quantileSeq` has more than two arguments so it can't use it as such.\r\n4. Ok, I will try\r\n5.

      "Thanks so much for the PR submission!\r\n\r\nSome comments/questions, not meant to be exhaustive at this point:\r\n\r\n(a) I thought we decided in the discussion in #2735 that if A = [1, 2, 3, 4] then A[[true, false, true]] is a dimension error, but the comment above seems to say this PR does not complain and returns [1,3]. Why not adhere to the recommended design?\r\n\r\n(b) Reviewing this PR revealed the pre-existing oddity that if B = [1,2;3,4] then (in the parser, easier to test) B[2,2] = 4 and B[2,[2,1]] = [[4,3]] (both pretty much as expected) but B[2,[2]] = 4 . I would expect the latter to produce [[4]]. (Or quite possibly B(2,[2,1]) to produce [4,3] and B(2,[2]) to produce [4], while B([2],[2,1]) produced [[4,3]].)  The current behavior seems to prevent certain dimensionality invariants (based on the dimensions of the matrix being indexed and the shape of the indices) from holding true. I bring these up because they produce the very surprising behavior that B([false, true], [true, true])) is [[3,4]] while B([[false,true]],[[true, false]]) is 3. It seems like a problem to me that the _type_ of the result differs for indices that are identical in type and shape and differ only in the value of a single boolean inside the indices. Hence, should I file the indexing oddity of B[2,[2,1]] vs B[2,[2]] as an issue? And should the boolean indexing wait until that newly surfaced issue is resolved? Or another possibility is to leave B(2,[2]) alone but still have B([false,true],[false,true]) return [[4]]. Thoughts, @josdejong ?",
      "Thanks for the review Glen!\r\n\r\n## (a)\r\nI was testing different methods to accomplish this but in the end I couldn't make it work thinking it would introduce breaking changes. The issue I couldn't resolve is.\r\n- `subset` hast the information of the size of the matrix and receives `index` (not the array of booleans). So it doesn't know what was the size of the array of booleans that generated the `index`.\r\n- `index` is the one that receives the array (and checks if it contains only booleans) but it doesn't know what is the size of the matrix it will be used in.\r\n\r\nIn the end I thought to present this PR that is comparable to what Octave does even though is not as agreed\r\n\r\n## (b)\r\n\r\nI think this behavior is related to #2344, it might make some cases simpler but in this case it's very odd. I think that behavior is as intended but let's wait for Jos's comments.\r\n\r\nIn the context of using logic inside of index it's not that odd.\r\n\r\n```\r\nA = [10, 20, 30, 40];\r\nA[A > 20] # yields [30, 40]\r\nA[A < 20] # yields 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe a proposal could be that if the index comes from an array, then the result should match the source regardless if it has singleton dimensions.\r\n```\r\nA = [1, 2; 3, 4]\r\nA[1, 2]          # shall return number 2\r\nA[[1], 2]        # shall return [2]\r\nA[1, [2]]        # shall return [2]\r\nA[[1], [2]]      # shall return [2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think these issues could be addressed independently\r\n\r\nJust as an example this is what the parser does with an array of booleans.\r\n```\r\nB = [10, 20, 30];\r\nB[[true]]             # yields 10\r\nB[[true, true]]       # yields [10, 10]\r\nB[[true, true, true]] # yields [10, 10, 10]\r\nB[B > 5]              # yields [10, 10, 10]\r\n```\r\n",
      "On (a), I guessed as much, but it seems like it's a case of implementation pushing behavior around. If the behavior desired is the one agreed on in #2735, then it seems like we need to find an implementation that supports that. For example, it could be that index objects are enhanced to allow vectors of booleans within them, and the \"index\" function just passes such specifiers through, so that subset can have all of the information and deal with it. There may be other possible implementations that would yield the desired behavior, just brainstorming.\r\n\r\nOn (b),\r\n> In the context of using logic inside of index it's not that odd.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> A = [10, 20, 30, 40];\r\n> A[A > 20] # yields [30, 40]\r\n> A[A < 20] # yields 10\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I find this extremely odd: depending on what the exact condition is, the result might be a vector or a number? That seems like it will be painful, since I will have to then write the expressions that use the result to handle either. It would seem much preferable that whatever the condition is, it should produce an array/vector as a result, that might have just one (or zero) entries.\r\n\r\n> Maybe a proposal could be that if the index comes from an array, then the result should match the source regardless if it has singleton dimensions.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> A = [1, 2; 3, 4]\r\n> A[1, 2]          # shall return number 2\r\n> A[[1], 2]        # shall return [2]\r\n> A[1, [2]]        # shall return [2]\r\n> A[[1], [2]]      # shall return [2]\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I think these issues could be addressed independently\r\n\r\nI agree that the existing shape-of-indexing-results oddity is the underlying problem, but if it were up to me, I'd first resolve that concern (in a separate issue/PR) before merging this boolean-indexing stuff, because of the very counterintuitive results it produces in the Boolean case. There are various options on how to modify the shapes of indexing results, so I would also suggest first an issue or a discussion to hash out the desired behavior, before a PR addressing the point. But let's see how @josdejong  wants to go -- another position might be to leave the shape of results of numeric indexing alone, and only fix the vector-vs-number inconsistency for Boolean indexing. That's not what I would do, but it's certainly possible to implement.",
      "Fair points\r\n\r\nI agree that the flexibility of showing either a number or an array depending on the case is odd for a program.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that in a different context wouldn't be that odd. Let's imagine a stack of paper in a box and I try to get them according to an index. If many pages are found they are returned in a manilla envelope, but when only one page is found there is no envelope, I might be glad to see the found page rather than complain about the missing envelope.\r\n\r\nboth a) and b) are consistent with the way [numpy indexes](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html), which would be really nice to have in mathjs, but might need more core changes.\r\n\r\nIn fact the other proposed change that an empty index gets you an empty array makes it even more odd that:\r\n```\r\nA = [10, 20, 30, 40];\r\nA[A > 20] # yields [30, 40]\r\nA[A < 20] # yields 10\r\nA[A > 50] # yields [ ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs if a set of many pages is presented in an envelope, a single page is without the envelope and no pages found gets you only the empty envelope.\r\n\r\nSo I mostly agree with you, at some point I thought about changing the behavior of index further as you mentioned but thought it might be unwelcome as it wasn't agreed upon. In fact I wasn't sure about returning an empty index (currently it just throws an error)\r\n\r\nI see some partial functionality that can be used in the meantime something better comes along, but as you mentioned, let's wait for Jos to weigh in.\r\n\r\nAs a reference, the current implementation of broadcasting is missing some optimization as making something like [numpy: nditer](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.nditer.html#arrays-nditer) would require some core changes in the matrix algorithm suite. Currently it is using the mathjs functions to make copies of matrices (requiring more memory) but it's actually working in the meantime an optimized solution can be implemented.",
      "Thanks David!\r\n\r\nThe logic behind the behavior of the function `subset` is: when the output contains a single, scalar value, unwrap it from the matrix and return the (numeric) value. When the output contains multiple values, return a matrix. I'm just happy with the current behavior, it is very practical when getting/setting individual values in a matrix that you don't have to worry about wrapping/unwrapping the value correctly. Also, I do like this proposal in #2344 to be able to disable this \"smart unwrapping\" feature if you need predictability. \r\n\r\nI do not really have a strong opinion about how `A[[1], 2]` and `A[1, [2]]` should behave. I think in practice you will not enter a nested array with just one value, so it is a bit of a theoretic case to me. It makes sense to let the output be an array then, instead of the current behavior of returning an unwrapped number.\r\n\r\nFor the new filtering behavior it makes sense to me to always return a Matrix/Array, and not unwrap the output when it contains only a single value.",
      "Hi Jos, thanks for the review\r\n\r\nOnly as a reference, It works like this by default:\r\n```\r\nA = [10, 20, 30, 40];\r\nA[A > 20] # yields [30, 40]\r\nA[A < 20] # yields 10\r\nA[A > 50] # yields [ ]\r\n```\r\nAnd now it includes this behavior with `math.config({ predictable: true})` according to #2344\r\n```\r\nA = [10, 20, 30, 40];\r\nA[A > 20] # yields [30, 40]\r\nA[A < 20] # yields [10]\r\nA[A > 50] # yields [ ]\r\n```",
      "Thanks, that is clear. \r\n\r\nWhilst there is a clear use case to let `A[0]` return a number `10` (and I would like to keep that behavior like it is), I do not see a use case for the filtering functionality returning a number, since a filtering operation in general has an array as input and an array with an arbitrary number of items as output. So I would like `A[A < 20]` to return `[10]` rather than `10` (always predictable). How do you think about that? Does that make sense to you? Or do you see use cases for that?",
      "Here is a possible case for that.\r\n```\r\nA = [1, 2, 3];\r\nB = [4, 5, 6];\r\nA[B == 5] # yields 2 or [2]\r\n```\r\nFor me it's the same logic as with regular indexing. If the index is a calculated variable, it's uncertain if the index will contain one or many numbers.\r\n\r\nOf course B could have various values equal to 5, so it's not predictable if the indexing with booleans will return one or many numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the references I know, it usually returns an array (the same as regular indexing in those references). So I don't know if it will also be confusing if the behavior of indexing is different if it comes from an array of booleans.",
      "Hm, yeah that is true, if you have a variable in `A[x]`, the output depends on whether `x` holds a number or a range for example. So, yeah, there is some logic to it.\r\n\r\nI just find it odd to have something like `A[A < 20]` or `A[B == 5]` return a number. Would _you_ want that in practice?",
      "Personally I wouldn't. I would prefer a predictable way as it can be used for other steps.\r\n\r\nI will look into a way for an array of booleans to always return predictable outcomes regarding of config. If there is some confusion later regarding regular indexing we can take a look into it.\r\n\r\nI think this is an in between state at some point it will need to be able to do something like.\r\n```\r\nA = 1:4;\r\nA[A > 2] = 6;\r\nA          # yields [1, 2, 6, 6]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this throws a dimensional error but we will need to take a look at some point regarding broadcasting the 6.\r\n```\r\nA[3:4] = 6\r\n```",
      "In this version:\r\n- Index class now\r\n  - Converts an array of booleans to an array of numbers\r\n  - Has a property to indicate the size of the array of booleans\r\n- Return predictable subsets if indexing with an array of booleans\r\n  - for other cases returns predictable subsets if `config.predictable`\r\n- Subsets now validates if the array of booleans had an equal size to the Array|Matrix and throws a dimensional error otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis behavior of returning a number when indexing with a single number or an array with a single element when indexing with an array of booleans is equivalent to numpy's way of indexing.\r\n\r\nOne difference is that indexing with booleans returns the same number of dimensions as the source but numpy reduces the other dimensions. ",
      "Hi, this version needed the most changes.\r\n\r\nTo be able to do broadcasting in subsets in the parser it was necessary to move some of the logic from `brodcast.js` to `utils/array.js` so that `DenseMatrix.subset` could benefit from broadcasting the replacement value to match the index size.\r\n\r\nNow something like this works both in the parser and outside the parser\r\n```\r\nA = [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\nA[A>2]              # yields [3, 4]\r\nA[A>2 and A<4]      # yields [3]\r\nA[[true, false]]    # yields error due to the not matching origin dimensions\r\nA[A>2] = 1.9;\r\nA                   # yields [1, 2, 1.9, 1.9]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's mostly done feature wise from the previous discussion, I expect many changes in the naming conventions or other stuff due to the many changes to make it work. So please let me know.",

      "I agree that the string rendering of the value that should be exactly zero is unsightly. However, I would argue the issue should be handled in the string rendering of the value rather than at the conversion calculation level. The proposed implementation uses `config.epsilon` in a way that doesn't match the [documented purpose of `epsilon`](https://mathjs.org/docs/core/configuration.html), which may be surprising to users (especially if they ~reduce~ increase the value of `epsilon` not expecting it to impact actual calculations). Second, it appears as though the proposed implementation would apply to both bignumber conversions and regular number conversions, thus significantly reducing the precision of bignumber calculations for values near zero.\r\n\r\nOne solution that can be used by the user of the library would be to use `format` rather than `toString` and to use the option to pass a callback function to `format` to round the number to the desired precision before the string rendering:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n> math.unit('32 degF').to('degC').format((value) => math.round(value,2).toString())\r\n'0 degC'\r\n``` \r\nThe benefit of this approach is that it works with other conversions that should be exact as well such as the conversion of -40 degrees:\r\n```javascript\r\n> math.unit('-40 degF').to('degC').toString()\r\n'-39.99999999999997 degC'\r\n> math.unit('-40 degF').to('degC').format((value) => math.round(value,2).toString())\r\n'-40 degC'\r\n```\r\n\r\n ",
      "I agree, this is not ideal and it is a misuse of `config.epsilon`.\r\nI thought we could handle this special case of round-off at its source but I'll have to think about it more. Rounding everything to 2 decimal places is not a good solution for me either.",
      "Rounding to 12 digits works as well and will give approximately the same precision as using epsilon since epsilon is 1e-12 by default:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n> math.unit('32 degF').to('degC').format((value) => math.round(value,12).toString())\r\n'0 degC'\r\n> math.unit('-40 degF').to('degC').format((value) => math.round(value,12).toString())\r\n'-40 degC'\r\n> math.unit('1 degF').to('degC').format((value) => math.round(value,12).toString())\r\n'-17.222222222222 degC'\r\n````\r\n\r\nThere's not a great way to get around the rounding issue at the unit conversion level when using the javascript number type since it's running into the [limitations of floating point math using the IEEE 754 standard](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/why-0-1-0-2-0-3-in-javascript-d7e218224a72). Here's the raw calculation using the javascript number type:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n> (32+459.67)*(1/1.8)-273.15\r\n5.684341886080802e-14\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, using the mathjs bignumber type would solve this issue since it doesn't face the same limitations as IEEE 754 floating point math. However, due to the way some of the conversion scaling factors are defined, using bignumber does not solve this particular issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n> math.unit(math.bignumber(32), 'degF').to('degC').toString()\r\n'2.1852e-14 degC'\r\n```\r\nThe bignumber issue arises from the definition of the of the temperature [scaling factor](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/23cf6e8035237747f5d197e659eeeaab3996bd89/src/type/unit/Unit.js#LL2312C1-L2312C22). Since `1/1.8` cannot be represented exactly as a javascript number type,  the precision is lost at the time of definition. Because of this, the later [conversion to bignumber](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/23cf6e8035237747f5d197e659eeeaab3996bd89/src/type/unit/Unit.js#LL837C13-L837C26) does not restore the precision. \r\n\r\n ",
      "Thanks for your PR Carl! \r\n\r\nA value like `\"5.684341886080802e-14 degC\"` does indeed look ugly. Whether or not this value is \"about zero\" depends on your context though. For example 1 electron volt is `1.602176565e-19 joule` and we should not round that to zero. We could make this behavior dependent on the type of unit, but I think that will become complex and unpredictable from an end user point of view.\r\n\r\nNow, the `.toString()` methods are simple and do not apply rounding. I think that is a good default behavior. You can use `.format({ precision: 12 })` for example if you do want to round the output to make it better readable. It will not round values close to zero though.\r\n\r\nIn general, mathjs recons with an epsilon in functions like `equal` and when formatting numbers using `format`. It uses a relative difference which works very well, except that it can't know when a value is close to zero. I think we should keep the behavior of `Unit.toString()` in line with the library as whole though, and keep it as is. What do you think?\r\n\r\nDocs: https://mathjs.org/docs/datatypes/numbers.html#equality\r\nRelated discussions: #1614, #2752, #2518",
      "This PR is only applicable to the very limited situation of unit conversions involving different offsets. This unique situation accumulates round-off errors which are beyond the precision of the offsets themselves. It seems like the appropriate place for improvement is within the `.to` method where the round-off happens, not necessarily in the `.toString` which affects everything.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this latest commit adds a few more unit tests and it uses the `Fraction(5, 9)` to more accurately represent 1/1.8. This is not perfect but it is able to pass the major tests which the current develop branch will fail.\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate the discussion. It has already allowed me to make a reasonably robust solution in my own project. I certainly understand that using a Fraction in the unit value is a big change and perhaps not the direction we want to go but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to implement.",
      "Thanks Carl, I really like the idea of defining units as an exact fraction whenever possible! This would indeed be a breaking change though. Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Right now, mathjs does not allow implicit conversion from Fraction to BigNumber, so you can't combine those in a single expression. The following gives an error right now:\r\n    ```js\r\n    math.evaluate('unit(fraction(2,5), \"degF\") + unit(bignumber(10), \"degF\")')\r\n    // TypeError: Cannot implicitly convert a Fraction to BigNumber or vice versa. Use function bignumber(x) to convert to BigNumber or fraction(x) to convert to Fraction.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    I think the reason for that was that you can lose precision when moving away from a Fraction. But that may be OK.\r\n2. Right now many constants have two implementations: if you ask `math.pi` you get a `number`, and if you configure `math.config({number: 'BigNumber'})` you will get a `BigNumber` implementation. We could do the same for the relevant units, and extend this mechanism to also create units as Fraction when you have configured `math.config({number: 'Fraction'})`. This last configuration option is a bit tricky though in general, and I'm not sure if that gives a usable solution.\r\n",
      "Hi Jos,\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand your thought 1; there is no implicit conversion needed. The `Unit.typeConverters` are called so the returned value type is matching the original value type. This is the same behavior as the current method. The incompatibility is with the type of `math.Unit.UNITS.degF.value` which is probably not accessed by most users.\r\n\r\n## Current\r\n```javascript\r\nmath.Unit.UNITS.degF.value                    // 0.5555555555555556\r\nmath.unit(98.6, 'degF').toNumeric('degC')     // 37.00000000000006\r\nmath.unit(10.5, 'degC',).toNumeric('degF')    // 50.899999999999935\r\n```\r\n## Proposed PR\r\n```javascript\r\nmath.Unit.UNITS.degF.value                    // Fraction(5, 9)\r\nmath.unit(98.6, 'degF').toNumeric('degC')     // 37\r\nmath.unit(10.5, 'degC',).toNumeric('degF')    // 50.9\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the internal calculation:\r\n```javascript\r\nf = math.fraction(5, 9)\r\nf*98.6 + Number(math.subtract(math.multiplyScalar(f, 459.67), 273.15))  // 37\r\n```",
      "Ah, I see what you mean. You want the `toNumeric()` to replace any internal Fraction with a number. I think that is best not to do, because when I explicitly create an unit holding a fraction, like `math.unit(math.fraction(1/3), 'cm')`, I would like to let `toNumeric()` return this fraction, and not convert it to a different numeric type. I think `Unit` itself should be agnostic to what numeric type it is dealing with exactly. Does that make sense?",
      "Hi Jos, sorry but I think you misunderstood. The returned value type is matching the original value type. This is the same behavior as the current method. The use of the Fraction(5,9) internally provides additional accuracy but does not affect the returned type. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\nmath.unit(math.fraction(32,1), 'degF').toNumeric('degC')    // Fraction(0,1)\r\n```",
      "To make sure we're on the same page: what would the type of the internal `math.unit(98.6, 'degF').value`? A number or a Fraction? At what moment do we switch from number to Fraction and back to number in the expression \r\n`math.unit(98.6, 'degF').toNumeric('degC')`? \r\n\r\n> This is the internal calculation:\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> f = math.fraction(5, 9)\r\n> f*98.6 + Number(math.subtract(math.multiplyScalar(f, 459.67), 273.15))  // 37\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nTo really utilize Fractions, all operations should be done with Fractions and only at the end we should convert the result to a number. Else you'll introduce rounding errors halfway the operation. So I think the proposed internal calculation should be something like the following, which results in a Fraction right now:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nf = math.fraction(5, 9)\r\nmath.add(math.multiply(f,98.6), math.subtract(math.multiply(f, 459.67), 273.15)) // Fraction 37\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now, when you do a mixed operation like `math.multiply(f,98.6)`, the number `98.6` will be turned into a Fraction (implicit type conversion), then two fractions are multiplied, and the result is a Fraction. So, naturally, `math.unit(98.6, 'degF').value` would be a Fraction when we change `math.Unit.UNITS.degF.value` into a Fraction and operate on that. \r\n\r\nI think that if we go this route, `math.unit(98.6, 'degF').value` should be a Fraction, and the conversion to a number should only be done at the last step. What are your thoughts?",
      "> what would the type of the internal math.unit(98.6, 'degF').value? A number or a Fraction?\r\n\r\nThis value is a number type, exactly like it has always been. This is due to the [liberal use of `_getNumberConverter` within the `_normalize` method](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/bf911816d3644e2780506930a0868484cd437630/src/type/unit/Unit.js#L499C1-L504) which was not altered by this PR.\r\n\r\n> At what moment do we switch from number to Fraction and back to number in the expression\r\nmath.unit(98.6, 'degF').toNumeric('degC')?\r\n\r\nThe use of fractions happens inside the `to` method which is called by `toNumeric`. The `to` method [uses `_getNumberConverter` at the end](_getNumberConverter) so that the numeric type of the unit's value remains consistent. This is enough to provide a big improvement in accuracy without unexpectedly changing the value to a fraction. It also avoids the possible loss of accuracy converting a BigNumber value into a fraction. The user still has the option to store value as a fraction if they define the unit with that type like this: `math.unit(math.fraction(98.6), 'degF')`\r\n\r\nThe PR includes a [handful of new tests, including tests with BigNumbers](https://github.com/costerwi/mathjs/blob/b0f1353f2bfce8cd937419e2b798285210405f04/test/unit-tests/type/unit/Unit.test.js#L300C1-L313), which might help to demonstrate its advantage. All of these new tests are passing in the PR but failing in the develop branch.",
      "Ahh, I finally get it 😅, thanks for your patience. \r\n\r\nI was assuming that `.value` would have to be a `Fraction` in order not to lose precision when converting °C to °F for example, but now I see that (a) in the method `.to()` you defer converting this Fraction to number until after the operations (so the operations are done as Fraction), and (b) when constructing a Fraction, the value is already normalized into the number type of the input number (in method `_normalize`). This is indeed a perfect solution, and I don't think it has side effects 😎 .\r\n\r\nTwo remarks:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a special reason you do the last `addScalar` after `convert`? I guess we can do `convert` last and wrap it around `addScalar`? \r\n2. In `._normalize()` and `._denormalize()` we too have a couple of conversions first and an operations next. Should we change that too to first do the operations and last the conversion? I can't come up with a case (it's like finding an `0.1+0.2` example that accidentally has a round-off error), but I guess it can happen with specific combinations of an input value and 1/1.8.",

      "The naming conflicts between functions and units `sec` and `min` are indeed unfortunate. We've been thinking about these naming conflicts before. \r\n\r\nThe way that symbols are resolved is: look it up in the provided scope, then look it up in the `math` namespace, and lastly, try to look it up as a unit. To resolve the naming conflict like you propose, we need to know whether the symbol will be invoked as a function or not. In a case like `min(...)` this is possible. But since mathjs supports lambdas, you do not always know upfront how a symbol will be used. In the following example we cannot know whether we must resolve `min` as function or as unit:\r\n\r\n```\r\nup = true\r\nf = up ? max : min\r\nf(values)\r\n```\r\nBecause of this ambiguity, we decided to not resolve symbols based on usage the context. As a user of the library you can alter the behavior though if you want: you simply chose one of the two by defining a variable, or you can write a preprocessor like you did if you want to utilize context information. But there is not a one-size-fits-all solution I think.\r\n\r\nAnd another workaround: wrap the unit in the function, like `unit('2 minute') - unit('2 min')`"

      "Thanks for digging into this issue and working on a fix Michael!\r\n\r\nI think that the current fix has some issues though: converting a BigNumber into a `Number` using `Number(...)` is tricky: I think it will fail for BigNumbers with more than 16 digits like `12345678901234567890.1234567890`. Also, it can introduce a duplicate `e` section, for example `Number('23e40')` will output `2.3e+41`. I think we should look further into a suitable solution.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the issue is that the rounded output of `.toPrecision(precision)` is not always used. But we should do it the BigNumber way. I think something like this should work:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  let valueStr = valueWithoutExp.toPrecision(precision)\r\n  if (valueStr.indexOf('e') !== -1) {\r\n    const BigNumber = value.constructor // trick to get access to the BigNumber constructor\r\n\r\n    // we don't use .toString(), since that can output an exponent again\r\n    valueStr = new BigNumber(valueStr).toFixed() \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should thoroughly test this though.",
      "Thanks for the feedback. In the branch of code for where I was using `Number` and `toString`, the max number size is 999 (max size of a coefficient in engineering notation) and the max precision is 1 or 2 (the case of 1 or 2 precision is the only time `valueStr` results in a number in scientific notation from the `toPrecision` method since insignificant zeros are not output, 1e2, for example, instead of 100). However, your suggestion of sticking with BigNumber and using `toFixed` is more consistent with the surrounding code and a better solution since it doesn't rely on the particularities of `toString`.\r\n\r\nI've incorporated your proposed changes and it does indeed work with all of the tests and solves the original issue.\r\n\r\nAfter adding the constructor trick you suggested, I did notice that the original JSDoc for the `value` input parameter specified a type union of `BigNumber | string`, however `string` would generate an error in the new code (and also for the previous code since it already accesses the `.e` property and the `.mul` member function). I removed the string type since it would have generated an error in the old code and the new code. It looks like there is already a [type gaurd](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/23cf6e8035237747f5d197e659eeeaab3996bd89/src/utils/string.js#L68) to prevent this function from being called with a string input and it looks like the same function [handles strings separately](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/23cf6e8035237747f5d197e659eeeaab3996bd89/src/utils/string.js#L88).",
      "I found an additional issue with format and bignumber. Setting precision to zero for 'fixed' notation results in full precision.

If you would prefer me to split it out, let me know and I can revert the commit and create a separate pull request. \r\n\r\n#### Details of issue and results of applying the fix:\r\n\r\nOld behavior:\r\n```\r\n> format(bignumber(1.333), {notation: 'fixed', precision: 0})\r\n'1.333'\r\n> format(bignumber(1.666), {notation: 'fixed', precision: 0})\r\n'1.666'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n```\r\n> format(bignumber(1.333), {notation: 'fixed', precision: 0})\r\n'1'\r\n> format(bignumber(1.666), {notation: 'fixed', precision: 0})\r\n'2'\r\n```\r\nWith the proposed fix, the behavior of format with bignumber matches the behavior with number.\r\n",

Getting BigNumbers right requires some effort: we need to be careful not accidentally throwing away precision by mixing numbers into the equation, and also we need to be careful to respect the configured precision, and use `pi` with the right precision etc.\r\n\r\nZooming a bit out I see we basically have two implementations: for real numbers and for complex numbers. The real number implementation is currently named `zetaBigNumber` and still a bit hard coded for BigNumbers, but we can make it a really generic function that accepts both `number` and `BigNumber`. It may be good to put the real number implementation in a separate file (for internal use), and use that in the `zeta` implementation. In the number-only version of mathjs (`factoriesNumber.js`) we could refer to this generic implementation since it works fine with just numbers.

      "Thanks Bruno, this PR looks solid. \r\n\r\nI have some doubts about whether this approach is a good one. The change needed in the unit test `simplifyAndCompare('3+sin(4)', '2.2431975046920716')` triggered me. I think we have two different things going on here:\r\n\r\n1. We want to handle round-off errors in floating point numbers smoothly. We do this by using `nearlyEqual` and an `epsilon`. That works well.\r\n2. We want to silently convert a number into a Fraction _only_ when the value can actually be represented as a fraction. We should not convert irrational numbers into Fractions, since that is not mathematically correct. It feels wrong to turn the result of `simplify('3+sin(4)')` into a Fraction since I know the result of `sin(4)` is an irrational number.\r\n\r\nThinking aloud here: if we want to keep (2) strict, we should see if we can solve the issue the other way around: instead of comparing a number and a Fraction by converting the number into a Fraction and then comparing two Fractions. Maybe we should turn the Fraction into a number and then compare the numbers using `nearlyEqual`. If we do that at the core of mathjs, it would mean changing the default of converting a number into a Fraction to converting a Fraction into a number, ie. `number==fraction` would change both sides to a number, but also `number+fraction` would change both sides into a number. \r\n\r\nAnother option would be to create a special case in the `equality functions to handle comparing numbers and Fractions differently, but I'm not sure we should go that way.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could simply accept this limitation:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst math = create(all, { number: 'Fraction' })\r\nmath.createUnit('rotation', {definition: '360 deg', aliases: ['tour','tr']})\r\n\r\nconst a1 = math.unit(360, 'deg')                   // a1 has a value being a number\r\nconst a2 = math.unit(math.fraction(360), 'deg')    // a2 has a value being a Fraction\r\nconst a3 = math.fraction(math.unit(360, 'deg'))    // not supported right now but we could implement that\r\nconst b = math.unit(1, 'rotation')                 // b has a value being a Fraction\r\n\r\nexpect(b.equals(a1))                   // Error (cannot convert the internal value of a1 to a Fraction)\r\nexpect(b.equals(a2))                   // true\r\nmath.evaluate('360 deg == 1 rotation') // true\r\n```\r\nWe could consider implementing support for `math.fraction(unit)` to make it easier to resolve these kind of conflicts.\r\n\r\nI have to think this through a bit more 🤔 . Do you have any thoughts?",
      "Thank Jos for the suggestions. Your point about not converting irrational numbers into fractions makes sense, that is not mathematically correct. Your suggestion of turning the Fraction into a number and then comparing the numbers using nearlyEqual seems like a possible solution, IMHO, but for now the most straightforward approach would be supporting ```math.fraction(unit)``` I guess.  But overall I'd expect that ``` math.unit(1, 'rotation')``` should be considered the same ```math.unit(360, 'deg')```. Thanks again ! ",
      "> But overall I'd expect that ` math.unit(1, 'rotation')` should be considered the same `math.unit(360, 'deg')`. Thanks again !\r\n\r\nYes agree. I think there are two underlying issues here. The first is discussed in https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/discussions/2734: mathjs functions do not automatically convert number inputs into the configured numeric data types (like BigNumber or Fraction). And second: the built-in units are created with a `number` as value. We could think through changing their values to BigNumber and Fraction if that is configured. But that cannot be done in all cases: some units have an irrational value and cannot be turned into a Fraction, and for irrational numbers we need high precision values to represent them as a BigNumber with actual high precision. That will require some investigation and at this point I'm not sure if that is worth the effort and will result in a good solution or not.\r\n\r\nFor now I think we should keep things simple:\r\n\r\n1. Close this PR: this approach unfortunately it will give unwanted side effects\r\n2. Implement `math.fraction(unit)`, to make solving these kind of issues easier. That requires little effort\r\n3. We can add a section in the docs about Units to explain that the built-in units always have a `number` as value\r\n\r\nAgree?",

      "Thanks for your PR @ziktar \r\n\r\nTwo thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of extending the API of simplify rule with a new option `ifCondition`, would it be possible to use a function as rule in your case? That is more flexible in general, but it may be more verbose.\r\n2. The reason that you need this condition is because the expression is not normalized and can have two orders. I remember we had some discussion about improving the normalization in this regard, maybe we should look into improvements in _that_ direction. Maybe it is also possible to check whether the rule is about a commutative operator (like `+`), then it could try to match if the rule matches in opposite order. Do you have any thoughts on that @gwhitney?",
      "@josdejong\r\n\r\nRegarding option 1, one goal I had was to keep the existing powerful node matching that exists in the current rules, so I wouldn't want to use the existing provide-a-single-function rule option that exists today. An improvement to what I did here could be to instead of adding the `ifCondition`, we could make the `r` parameter optionally be a function. This function would be called with the matches, and could return `false` (thus not making a change, which is what `ifCondition` allows), or it could return a node string response (in the same format that a string `r` would have), and then that replacement could be used. This would be a little bit trickier to implement (from what I can tell, we just need to make sure that the rule function knows about the expanded forms), but I think it would be possible/better than what I have here.\r\n\r\nThe end goal for me is to be able to sort terms/factors consistently (such as by polynomial degree in the easy case of a bunch of polynomials and alphabetic for polynomials of the same degree, and using some pattern in the more complicated expressions)\r\n\r\nAs such, regarding option 2, I imagine that I could get to normalized ordering by checking if the rules matched both current and opposite order, but it would still need some logic to be able to compare the two terms beyond just being c vs v vs ve. So we'd need to be able to use a method that compares two terms, so we'd have to extend the simplify rules logic to be able to specify that function being used to compare them. If we're not letting the user add whatever logic they want, then we'll need to make sure that whatever we expose here is comprehensive, so we'll need to make sure our comparison function can compare any expression; `math.compareNatural` is the best contender for this, but it currently cannot compare complicated expressions (`math.compareNatural(math.parse('x^2'), math.parse('sin(x)'))` works but `math.compareNatural(math.parse('x^2'), math.parse('x*sin(x)'))` does not).\r\n\r\n",
      "**About point 2**\r\n\r\nIt's indeed not trivial. It requires thorough thinking through, maybe best to park these ideas for now and focus on making the simplify rule system more flexible. \r\n\r\n**About point 1**\r\n\r\nJust to be clear: I'm not ruling out your initial solution with `ifCondition`, but exploring if this is indeed the best solution we can come up with.\r\n\r\nInteresting idea to make the `r` dynamic by having it as a callback function. I'm not sure how complex that would be to implement. It may be that the concept would be a bit confusing to understand too.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking into a different direction: right now a rule can basically defined high level as `{ l, r }`, or as a low level call back function. But now we want something in between. Would it be possible to extract the logic behind `{ l, r }` into utility functions that you can then use inside your own callback function? Something like `matchesRule(node)` and `applyRule(node, rule)`? Or maybe the latter is already enough, so you can write a custom rule like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction customRule(node) {\r\n  if (satisfiesCondition(node)) {\r\n    return applyRule(node, rule, context)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"

Do you plan on adding more tests? ",

Section on the documentation OK\r\n2. Negative impact: I agree, I specifically added that check of the matrix size to skip everything for existing operations.

      "Thanks Jakub for picking this up!\r\n\r\nA few feedbacks:\r\n\r\n1. Besides support for `Array`, can you also add support for `Matrix`? It's probably most neat to write the signatures directly in the object like:\r\n    ```js\r\n    const gcdManySignature = {\r\n      [`${gcdTypes}, ${gcdTypes}, ...${gcdTypes}`]: ...\r\n      'Array': ...\r\n      'Matrix': ...\r\n    }\r\n2. What do we want to happens when a 2d matrix or array like `[[1,2],[3,4]]` is entered? An error? Flattening the contents?",
      "> 2\\. What do we want to happens when a 2d matrix or array like `[[1,2],[3,4]]` is entered? An error? Flattening the contents?\r\n\r\nOr taking gcds along a dimension like mean? Seems like there should be some level of consistency in these accumulation-type operations...",
      "> Besides support for Array, can you also add support for Matrix? It's probably most neat to write the signatures directly in the object like:\r\n\r\nok, will do\r\n\r\n\r\n> What do we want to happens when a 2d matrix or array like [[1,2],[3,4]] is entered? An error? Flattening the contents?\r\n\r\nFlattening seems fine.\r\n",
      "Do we have _any_ analogues of flattening in this circumstance? It seems fairly ad-hoc to me, and likely not to be what the caller intended. If there isn't a palatable option that is analogous to an existing function like mean() then I'd suggest just erroring in the case of >1 dimension. That seems safer and if the person meant to flatten, well, it's easy enough to explicitly do so. Just my 2c.",
      "Good points @gwhitney , we should be careful to keep the behavior consistent with other functions in the library. I think your suggestion makes sense: calculating the result it along a dimension like `mean` does. Before we decide on that I think it would be good to have a look at what other math applications do in this case, and think it through a bit more. \r\n\r\nWe can go two directions with this PR: \r\n1. Only implement 1-d support for now, throw an error for multi dimensional matrices\r\n2. Do research and think through what behavior would best for multi dimensional matrices and implement that.\r\n\r\nI'm OK with both, though I have a slight preference to split this in two steps, i.e. do step (1) now, and step (2) separately. What do you think @jakubriegel .\r\n",
      "I support implementing 1d for now and others in separate PR.\r\n\r\nI've researched NumPy and this is what they do with their `np.gcd`:\r\n- the method supports only two number arguments, ex. `np.gcd(14,21) == 7`\r\n- for arrays they have `np.gcd.reduce`, where they return gcd of all numbers, ex. `np.gcd.reduce([14,21]) == 7`\r\n- they also have something I'd call gcd-by-element, ex. `np.gcd([14,21], 7) == [7, 7]`\r\n- above works also for multidimensional arrays, ex. `np.gcd.reduce([[21,14], [7, 2]]) == [7, 2]` or `np.gcd([21,14], [7, 2]) == [7, 2]`\r\n\r\nAs this gets complicated, I think there is no point lin looking for fast solution.\r\n\r\nNumPy logs:\r\n<img width=\"601\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32958017/214624621-dcf3933d-a5ea-4471-975e-ea7864e2f1c7.png\">\r\n",
      "Please decide what's the right path to go:\r\n- merging as is, since the 1d array behaviour matches others\r\n- add check for not inserting nd array\r\n- remove array support\r\n\r\n@josdejong @gwhitney ",
      "Thanks for your research @jakubriegel . It sounds like a good plan to me to keep this PR simple and limit to 1d support for now 👍\r\n\r\nQua code, we need a bit more than the current `Array` signature: an Array can also hold multiple dimensions. I think the PR should look something along the following lines:\r\n\r\n- Add a signatures for `Matrix` and `Array` to the function `gcd`\r\n- In both cases, get the `size` of the input, and verify that it is a vector\r\n- When it is a vector, evaluate it, and when not, throw an exception \r\n- We should have unit tests covering 1d Array, 1d Matrix, 2d Array, and 2d Matrix (the last two should throw an exception)\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense Jakub?",

I am glad about that! I am still yet intrigued on the impact when simplifying associative exprs. with significant quantities of operands in this context, since in-fact each associative rule is set to be applied up to four times now instead of two; but like you say it is most-probably less common that this function will be consumed in this way.\r\n2. Indeed, it was a tricky implementation upon its attempt - it sounded nice, but with trying to integrate into the current code, too many tricks were made to get it to work with it finally ending up being non-optimal and with it the code less readable. Perhaps another time!\r\n3. (implementation points)\r\n\r\n   1. Yes - the only reason for my doing that was for more a sensible placeholder-index progression (in terms of expanded rule strings). For example, with the current location of generating the `leftExpandSym`, when generating rules for `n*n -> n^2`, the double-placeholder expanded expression will look like `_p0 * n * n * _p1`, instead of `_p1 * n * n * _p0`. Perhaps a little less confusing during debugging, but I can make your change if you would like.\r\n   2. I thought that too, but I stuck with the cloning because of the original line of code for gen. the expanded rule -> `newRule.expanded.l = makeNode([newRule.l.clone(), expandsym])`.\r\n      In this change, I could either remove the original `rule.l.clone()` for all expanded rules, or perhaps this could be cloned just once?\r\n   3. Yes; think that makes sense. Will make sure to do that!\r\n\r\nOk!",

      "This is a very nice contribution! But the improved constant folding in foldOp can still be done in one pass, not two: as you go through the argument list, keep a (possibly empty) tree and a (possibly empty) operand. If the next argument is not a Node, try to fold it with the current operand, or if there is none, make it the current operand. Otherwise, coalesce the tree so far and the operand (reverted to a constant node), if any, and the new argument into the new tree (with the running operand empty). I think a single-pass algorithm like this would be more concise and easy to understand. Could you try to adjust your PR along such lines?",
      "Hello and thank you @gwhitney, and thanks for the suggestion!\r\n\r\nI did wonder whether it was possible to do with one pass, but decided against thinking it through under the assumption that it would be a bit inelegant or a bit of a hassle. But you are right, checking *ahead* should provide enough info for, as you say, knowing whether to collapse the current operand into the newly reduced tree (or create the tree/first node). I will make some changes later today and hope to hear what you think of the next iteration !",

I will also post a one-pass reduce-based version that is shorter but I think harder to understand.

      "Also, as submitted, I think the original 2-pass version will fail on something like `a + 0 + 7 + b` where the first operand in an internal group that needs to be coalesced happens to be a \"falsy\" value, since the `if (a && ...)` part of the condition in the first pass will fail. That would need to be tested. And now I am also worried my version above will fail if one of the args happens to be the constant `undefined` -- I think it will not try to fold it with the next arg, but instead just replace it with it. So it might well fold `undefined + 7` to just `7`, which is not right -- that would have to be tested.",
      "OK, here's the promised reduce-based version. It's a little mysterious, but not so much more so than the code before this PR with its slightly odd triple test of whether a and b are Nodes or not (which is gone in this version). It is significantly shorter than my \"clearer\" suggestion, and as far as I can tell does not suffer from any problems with falsy or `undefined` constants. It also only does the try-catch for folding constants in one place. So I'd say on balance it is my recommendation. I will leave it to the two of you to pick among the various options (or some evolution of any of them) but please be sure to test on 0 and `''` and `undefined` inputs. Thanks!\r\n```js\r\nfunction foldOp (fn, args, makeNode, options) {\r\n    const first = args.shift()\r\n    // In the following reduction, sofar always has one of the three following\r\n    // forms: [NODE], [CONSTANT], or [NODE, CONSTANT]\r\n    const reduction = args.reduce((sofar, next) => {\r\n      if (!isNode(next)) {\r\n        const last = sofar.pop()\r\n        if (isNode(last)) {\r\n          return [last, next]\r\n        }\r\n        // Two constants in a row, try to fold them into one\r\n        try {\r\n          sofar.push(_eval(fn, [last, next], options))\r\n          return sofar\r\n        } catch (ignoreandcontinue) {\r\n          sofar.push(last)\r\n          // fall through to Node case\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      sofar.push(next)\r\n      // Collapse everything so far into a single tree:\r\n      return [sofar.reduce(\r\n        (a, b) => makeNode([_ensureNode(a), _ensureNode(b)])\r\n      )]\r\n    }, [first])\r\n    if (reduction.length === 1) {\r\n      return reduction[0]\r\n    }\r\n    // Might end up with a tree and a constant at the end:\r\n    return makeNode([reduction[0], _toNode(reduction[1])])\r\n  }\r\n```",
      "Thanks Glen, these are two really nice iterations of the function! Thanks to the comments it's quite clear what's going on. \r\n\r\nThe duplicated logic in the first approach of @samueltlg is indeed also not ideal, it's worth trying to find a solution without this duplication.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing that I do not fully understand in your [second iteration](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/2827#issuecomment-1299584659): why is the second `reduce` in \r\n`return [sofar.reduce(...)]` needed? I do not expect issues here, but loops inside loops is something I try to avoid generally since performance can get bad. Is this second reduce replaceable with just an operation on the last two entries or `sofar` maybe? Or will rewriting this again result in [your first iteration](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/2827#issuecomment-1299535619)?\r\n",
      "> why is the second `reduce` in\r\n> `return [sofar.reduce(...)]` needed?\r\n\r\nIt is because at this point, sofar may have exactly two or three entries, and they need to be reduced to a single Node. So this second reduce was the briefest way to express that. The last two lines of the outer reducing function could be replaced with something like:\r\n```\r\nsofar.push(_ensureNode(sofar.pop()))\r\nconst newtree = (sofar.length === 1) ? sofar[0] : makeNode(sofar)\r\nreturn [makeNode([newtree, _ensureNode(next)])]\r\n```\r\nif you like that better. (Note here next is never pushed onto sofar so it has one or two entries, which are unified into a tree if there are two, and subsequently combined with next.)",
      "(Note I just wrote that freehand, I haven't tested it, unlike the first two which passed all of the tests in develop -- neither have run with samueltlg's new tests or my recommended tests with various falsy constant operands.)",
      "Thanks for your attempts/contributions @gwhitney. I like them both, but will later spend more time forming an opinion of the first attempt.\r\n\r\nI spent considerable time breaking down the logic in your second attempt. The idea of returning a tuple for `sofar` was the idea I had initially! But it seems to work OK! I was inspired to try an attempt from scratch after seeing what you had done there with those two attempts, mainly to see how concise the solution could really be made (with a _single_ reduce statement). Here's what I came up with:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  function foldOp (fn, args, makeNode, options) {\r\n    // current uncollapsed constants encountered in args\r\n    const currentConstants = []\r\n\r\n    // reduce the new tree whilst simultaneously evaluating adjacent constants\r\n    // ('sofar' is always either a tree or undefined (in the case of args. being solely constituted\r\n    // by Fractions))\r\n    let reduction = args.reduce((sofar, next) => {\r\n      if (isNode(next)) {\r\n        const constantsQty = currentConstants.length\r\n\r\n        if (!constantsQty) {\r\n          // collapse node into tree, or set as the first tree/node\r\n          return sofar ? makeNode([sofar, next]) : next\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        const newTreeNodes = []\r\n        if (sofar) newTreeNodes.push(sofar)\r\n\r\n        // evaluate together all  constants/fractions, or return the sole current constant\r\n        const evaluationResult = tryEval(fn, options, currentConstants)\r\n\r\n        currentConstants.length = 0\r\n\r\n        newTreeNodes.push(_ensureNode(evaluationResult), next)\r\n\r\n        // Collapse previous tree (if present), uncollapsed constants (now simplified/eval'd and in\r\n        // node form), and new/current node\r\n        return newTreeNodes.reduce((a, b) => makeNode([a, b]))\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      currentConstants.push(next)\r\n\r\n      // Either the current tree, or undefined\r\n      return sofar\r\n    }, undefined)\r\n\r\n    // evaluate trailing constants, and collapse into tree (if formed)\r\n    if (currentConstants.length) {\r\n      const trailingConstResult = tryEval(fn, options, currentConstants)\r\n      reduction = reduction ? makeNode([reduction, _ensureNode(trailingConstResult)]) : trailingConstResult\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Thr reduced tree (if args contains at least *one* node), or a Fraction\r\n    return reduction\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Attempt evaluation between all args provided.\r\n     * If args is a one-length array, returns the only entry.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param {*} fn\r\n     * @param {*} options\r\n     * @param {*} args\r\n     * @returns\r\n     */\r\n    function tryEval (fn, options, args) {\r\n      if (args.length === 1) return args[0]\r\n\r\n      try {\r\n        const result = _eval(fn, args, options)\r\n        return result\r\n      } catch (ignoreandcontinue) {\r\n        return undefined\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it bears significant resemblance to gwhitney's second attempt, albeit with some refactoring (extracting eval. procedure, for example), and doing away with the tuple for `sofar`. Additionally, you may notice that sequences of adjacent constants are all evaluated in one call to `_eval`, which I don't think there should be a problem with?\r\n\r\nAnd also, @josdejong, I have gone along with Glen's second-attempt reduce statement which has just been clarified. The same is also the case here; there should not be more than three iterations, and the use-case in both of our scenarios I think is always `[node, constant, node]`.\r\n(**problematically** also, I have not accounted for failure-calls to `tryEval` . And notably, exprs 'a + 0 + 7 + b' and 'a * 0 * 7 * b' seem to eval. fine in commutative + non-commutative contexts)\r\n\r\nSo I just attempted that for the challenge and the heck of it. One adv. is that it is also more readable similarly to these latest attempts. I'll have another look at all three later once I've had a rest from cognition! What do you two think? Is this one readable to you?",
      "My apologies, I don't see how the latest proposal from samueltlg can be correct. In this version, if the eval in the attempt to fold constants throws an error, the tryEval returns undefined, which is then inserted in the tree, and the collected constants are thrown away. That's not a valid simplification; the old behavior is simply to preserve the constants that caused the throw as ConstantNodes. If there is not a unit test that exercises this behavior, one should be added. I stand by my recommendation of the following (with the second reduce unrolled for clarity/efficiency):\r\n```\r\nfunction foldOp (fn, args, makeNode, options) {\r\n    const first = args.shift()\r\n    // In the following reduction, sofar always has one of the three following\r\n    // forms: [NODE], [CONSTANT], or [NODE, CONSTANT]\r\n    const reduction = args.reduce((sofar, next) => {\r\n      if (!isNode(next)) {\r\n        const last = sofar.pop()\r\n        if (isNode(last)) {\r\n          return [last, next]\r\n        }\r\n        // Two constants in a row, try to fold them into one\r\n        try {\r\n          sofar.push(_eval(fn, [last, next], options))\r\n          return sofar\r\n        } catch (ignoreandcontinue) {\r\n          sofar.push(last)\r\n          // fall through to Node case\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      // Encountered a Node, or failed folding --\r\n      // collapse everything so far into a single tree:\r\n      sofar.push(_ensureNode(sofar.pop()))\r\n      const newtree = (sofar.length === 1) ? sofar[0] : makeNode(sofar)\r\n      return [makeNode([newtree, _ensureNode(next)])]\r\n    }, [first])\r\n\r\n    if (reduction.length === 1) {\r\n      return reduction[0]\r\n    }\r\n    // Might end up with a tree and a constant at the end:\r\n    return makeNode([reduction[0], _toNode(reduction[1])])\r\n  }\r\n```",

I thought that I would just have an attempt from scratch after coming across your two approaches (for my second attempt/first attempt at a single reduce statement, I left the existing code in place as much as I could, and only attempted to 'add' code, whilst this time inspired by what you had done, I was intrigued to see how it would turn out from a total re-write).\r\n\r\nAnd I also remark in the comment that my attempt does not account for failure of eval. of constants; I'm sure that with some slight modification it could be made to work, though.\r\n\r\nIn any case, at minimum we have some working solutions now!\r\n\r\n\r\nedit; and also, I can see that perhaps my recent version is not correctable; i.e. it is not sensible to evaluate multiple Fraction instances all in one go without anticipating that an error may be thrown?

      "> Could you please offer an example of a test where evaluation (between Fractions?) fails?\r\n\r\nNot 100% sure. One way is to set config.number to bignumber in a mathjs instance that doesn't have bignumbers, but that sounds like a pain to set up. Maybe something like `7 + 'foo'` or `3 / 0` (but I don't know whether the latter ever makes it to foldOp) or these same sorts of things embedded in larger expressions. Jos, do you happen to know any examples of why the try-catch for the operation on constants throwing an error was put in?",

In fact in develop right now without any context, `2 + 7 + 'foo' + 3 + 8` simplifies to `9 + 'foo' + 3 + 8` which is arguably a bug -- if it's gonna collapse the first two operands to 9, it oughta collapse the last two to 11.

I'm happy to help resolve the issue, though I'm not sure the etiquette: would you want another PR into your branch? (Or happy to leave it to you.)",
      "Thanks for your clear feedback @ChristopherChudzicki . It makes sense to me to not mark this as a breaking change, but as a bug fix of the regression introduced in `v11.3`. In some way, every bug fix is a breaking change, since it alters the original behavior 😜 .\r\n\r\n@mattvague can you still write a paragraph in the documentation page [/docs/expressions/customization.md](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/develop/docs/expressions/customization.md)?",

      "**TLDR:** This only partially brings back the discriminated union, and I think the \"only partially\" makes the result confusing, and so maybe this isn't worth it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith the goal of finishing up this PR (or starting a new one), I just took another look at this, which revealed some issues/features of the current approach that I think could be confusing.\r\n\r\nFor example, as a user consuming the library:\r\n```ts\r\n// Reminder: \r\n//  - BaseNode = generic interface\r\n//  - MathNode = extensible collection that supports discriminated unions\r\n\r\nconst myFunctions = (node: MathNode) => {\r\n    node.traverse(child => {\r\n        // child has type MathNode, so discriminated unions work.\r\n        // Cool!\r\n    })\r\n\r\n\r\n    if (node.type === 'ArrayNode') {\r\n        // \"items\" has type BaseNode[]\r\n        // Surprising/Confusing! Why isn't items MathNode[] ???\r\n        const items = node.items\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an end user, I would expect to always get a `MathNode`, and I would be confused why sometimes I get just a `BaseNode` (whose `node.type` property is just \"string\", so won't support discriminated unions.)\r\n\r\nI would **love** to have the discriminated union back: it is very convenient and makes node types much more discoverable. But IMO, the combination of \r\n- unpredictability of \"sometimes I get BaseNode, sometimes I get MathNode\"\r\n- increased complexity from supporting an extensible discriminated union\r\nmight make this not worth it.\r\n\r\n**Can the unpredictability be removed?**: Maybe, but I can't figure out how. Everything I've tried leads to TS complaining about circularly defined types. (E.g., changing the default type parameter of ArrayNode [here](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/2820/files#diff-093ad82a25aee498b11febf1cdcb6546e4d223ffcb49ed69cc275ac27ce0ccceR182) to MathNode leads to TS complaining.)",
      "Thanks for digging further @ChristopherChudzicki . So, would this PR be a (little) step in the right direction you think? Or better to start from scratch?",
      ">@mattvague do you see any chance finishing up this PR? If not I can see if I can write the docs.\r\n\r\nHi there @josdejong, very sorry for disappearing. Unfortunately I don't see being able to work on this in the next few weeks, but if someone else can take the charge I'm happy to provide feedback if wanted. I agree the inconsistency between `BaseNode` and `MathNode` is confusing and the reason we ended up doing that (if I recall) was exactly the \"circularly defined types.\" issue @ChristopherChudzicki mentioned, I'm not sure what to do about that at the moment. Maybe it's best to check some other OSS libraries with a similar concept and see what they do?",

I'm a bit stuck on this. I'll keep an eye out for potential solutions, but probably won't be actively working on it.

      "Thanks for working out this minimal example that demonstrates the TS issues to make this work! This helps a lot.

I think we can live without discriminated unions and use typeguards to narrow down on types (see https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/2810#issuecomment-1277516502), so the current 2&3 is the second best?

      "My only worry about this is that I seem to recall that when we initially set up the typescript test, the index.ts would sometimes run ok even when it had typescript errors. I.e. those errors would only surface during the tsc command. But now the tsc is not compiling the tests/testTypes.ts file, so I worry problems might sneak through. So I recommend putting tests/testTypes.ts back into the files parameter of the tsconfig.\r\n\r\nAlso there is now an unnecessary leading space in the package.json script parameter for the typescript test ",
      "Thanks, very sharp. I think you're referring to #2633.\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce this original issue, but could not get the original problem back: both a mistake in `index.d.ts` as well as in `testTypes.ts` do throw an exception. \r\n\r\nI did the following:\r\n\r\n1. The `\"test:types\"` script runs both `tsc` and `ts-node`. I remove the `tsc` part from the script so it only runs `ts-node`.\r\n2. I removed the return type from the function `simplifyConstant` in `index.d.ts`. Running `npm run test:types` does not throw an error. this validates that we indeed need to run `tsc` too to be able to capture those errors.\r\n3. I reverted the changes of (2) in `index.d.ts`\r\n4. Right below the type definition of function `testFun()` in `testTypes.ts` (line 1897), I added a function `testFun2()` with a missing return type. Running `npm run test:types` _does_ throw an error about the missing return type. So apparently we do not need to run `tsc` to capture these kind of mistakes in `testTypes.ts`, we only need that for `index.d.ts`. \r\n \r\nSo I think we're safe. Or am I overlooking something?",
      "Well I agree your procedure sounds good. I will admit I am confused as to why the `tsc` command compiles anything since it no longer has any \"files\" parameter. But clearly from your tests it identifies problems with the index.d.ts file that the ts-node command does not. Hence there's something about the tsc configuration I don't understand, but the process you outline is convincing that the tests are finding problems everywhere we want them to, so I am content with this PR. Would you like me to merge it?",

So:\r\n\r\n- We run `ts-node` to run the tests and detect type issues in `testTypes.ts`, but `ts-node` does not complain about all issues in `index.d.ts` \r\n- We run `tsc` to spot issues in `index.d.ts`",

      "Thanks, I quite like this approach, splitting the functionality per node class. \r\n\r\nOnly downside is that this makes all Node classes a bit more fat again, and when you don't need the functionality you still have to load the full classes. An alternative would be to add a callback handler to the `resolve` function similar to the callback handler that you can pass to `Node.toString` or so.\r\n\r\n@gwhitney do you have any thoughts on this?",
      "Well, at first glance, to get the same effect/ability that Matt is after while avoiding the drawbacks of adding code to every Node class that will only be used by clients that want to do `resolve`ing (which may not be that common), couldn't we rather leverage typed-function and proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n* Note that in `src/function/algebra/resolve.js` the workhorse function is primarily just a big switch on the node type, with a fallback for nodes that do not have a specific algorithm. So split this into several smaller functions, one for each node type that has its own resolve approach, and one for that fallback.\r\n* Add each of these functions as separate implementations in the typed-function for resolve, typed with the specific node types. Note that types for each of the specific node types are already in the typed-function type universe for mathjs ordered before the generic Node type, so all of the individual specific implementations will be tried before the generic one.\r\n* Then the client with a custom node type just has to make sure to add that node type to the typed-universe (thankfully because of update to typed-function v3 you can request a newly added type comes before a specific type, so the client can put it before the generic Node type).\r\n* Finally, the client merges a specialized implementation for resolve typed for the custom node type to the built-in resolve with `math.import({resolve: myCustomNodeResolution})`\r\n\r\nI think this approach has a much lighter footprint on existing mathjs code, will all work, and accomplishes everything Matt was aiming for. That said, I haven't actually tried it, so there could be speedbumps I am not seeing... Hope this helps.",
      "> adding code to every Node class that will only be used by clients\r\n\r\nYes, that is an issue indeed, it makes the Node classes more bloated, and that code is only relevant for people using the `resolve` function.\r\n\r\nSo, an other approach could indeed be making the `resolve` function itself extensible. I like Glen's idea of seeing if we can utilize the function being a typed-function, just being able to add another signature for another Node type. Or alternatively we could extend the function with some callback or extra parameter that allows passing additional logic and nodes.

      "Thanks Glen for working out a demonstration in #2801. I quite like that the Node classes are not aware of anything related to `resolve` in that approach.

Having to override three different signatures (in the example: `'IntervalNode'`, `'IntervalNode, Object|Map|null|undefined'`, and `'IntervalNode, Map|null|undefined, Set'` is relatively complex though and can be a barrier for people. \r\n\r\nAn other idea: we can go with the approach of Matt, but instead of basing it on methods `Node.resolve`, we can could configure a map with the node name as key and a resolve function as value and attach this map to the function or pass it as argument. Or we can have a handler callback similar to the `transform` function where you can inspect the node type yourself and resolve it. \r\n\r\n@mattvague what are your thoughts?",
      "The \"overriding three signatures\" thing is because typed-function doesn't allow optional arguments. I don't see why this architecture/leveraged use of typed-function should be penalized because of that.\r\n\r\nBut based on your comment, the implementations can be rearranged so that there are single generic forwarders with undifferentiated Node arguments and only one \"workhorse\" for each Node subtype. Shall I push a commit with that refactor so you all can look? (Also I can fix the doc error.)",
      "OK, I went ahead and rearranged the implementations in #2801 so that to add any new node type, you only have to supply the `NewNodeType, Map|undefined|null, Set` signature. (It has to be the most elaborate one so that generic forwarders can supply any missing arguments; there is no way to figure out how to handle all three arguments if only given an implementation that doesn't take all of them.) Also, the documentation tests are all passing now. Hopefully that's better?",
      "😎 nice, these last tweaks in your PR take away my argument against your proposed solution Glen. I think #2801 is a perfectly good solution now, and going for this approach or these alternative ideas I proposed is mostly a matter of personal preference. \r\n\r\n@mattvague any feedback?"

      "Thanks Matt for picking this up 👍 \r\n\r\nThe reason that there is no recursive implementation of `.toJSON()` is that this is handled by `JSON.stringify` already. The docs explain how to use it:\r\n\r\nDocs: https://mathjs.org/docs/core/serialization.html\r\n\r\nSo right now, `JSON.stringify` (and `math.replacer`) is your generic `toJSON` function :). I think we can do the same for the new functions `fromObject` and `toObject`, so let them handle the iteration and call the `fromJSON` and `toJSON` methods. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI think if you use `JSON.stringify` and let the `toJSON` methods to do the iteration themselves too, it will iterate twice, which is bad for performance."

      "Hello,\r\n\r\nI just solved the conflict in the author's file.",
      "Thanks for the ping @egidioln , for some reason I totally forgot about this PR, I'm sorry 😳 .\r\n\r\nYou're right about the BigNumbers, that is not supported by `qr` unfortunately, so it's not possible to make this work for these three new functions right now.\r\n\r\nAll in all this PR looks very good. Thanks for writing the documentation and unit tests. Two more questions:\r\n\r\n1. When I evaluate the matrices in the unit tests using Octave, I get differing results for `schur` and `sylvester` (`lyap` gives the same results though with inverted sign). How can I know that these outcomes are indeed valid? Are there multiple valid results possible?\r\n2. Thanks for adding the type definitions, including the chained calls. I think you forgot to define the chained function call for `sylvester`? Can you also add a (small) usage example in types/index.ts to verify that the definitions are valid?",
      "No Worries @josdejong, thanks for doing this check :)\r\n \r\n>     1. When I evaluate the matrices in the unit tests using Octave, I get differing results for `schur` and `sylvester` (`lyap` gives the same results though with inverted sign). How can I know that these outcomes are indeed valid? Are there multiple valid results possible?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the [schur decomposition is not unique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_decomposition#Notes). One can verify the correctness of the decomposition by comparing $A$ (input) and $UTU^\\top$ (outputs).\r\n \r\nFor `sylvester` and `lyap`, there are some mismatching definitions for these equations in the literature. For instance, the Sylvester equation is defined as $AX+XB=C$ in [octave](https://octave.sourceforge.io/control/function/lyap.html)/matlab, as $AX-XB=C$ in [Bartels-Stewart's paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361573.361582) (which I used to code the algorithm) and as $AX+sXB^\\top=C$ in [LAPACK](https://netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d9/df5/group__double_s_yauxiliary_gaf104dd54134c1a4ddb0d573ff9fe6d06.html#gaf104dd54134c1a4ddb0d573ff9fe6d06), where s is an input 1 or -1.\r\n\r\nFor the Lyapunov equation in [octave](https://octave.sourceforge.io/control/function/lyap.html)/matlab it is $AX+XA'=-Q$ but I actually coded it as $AX+XA'=Q$, which is a format I also see often and matches better the Sylverster equation. \r\n\r\nHowever, thinking better now, maybe it is a good idea to have a notation for these that matches octave/matlab, do you agree?   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>     2. Thanks for adding the type definitions, including the chained calls. I think you forgot to define the chained function call for `sylvester`? Can you also add a (small) usage example in types/index.ts to verify that the definitions are valid?\r\n\r\nActually, maybe I wasn't clear but I had mentioned above that I didn't implement it because  `sylvester` requires 3 inputs $(A,B,C)$  and would be a bit confusing to use it in a chained call as I am not sure which of the arguments should be declared/taken from the chained operation (maybe $A$?). \r\n",
      "ah, that makes sense. Your explanation of the different definitions in differing math applications helps me a lot understanding what is going on. That complicates things. \r\n\r\nSo first thing is to clearly document this, which you did. It may be good to mention the existence of an alternative definition in the documentation so the user is aware that he may be assuming one or the other definition.\r\n\r\nIn general I try to use the \"most commonly\" used definition: what do Matlab, Mathematica, and Pythons NumPi for example use? Do you have an idea what is the most common definition for these three functions?\r\n\r\nAs for the missing chained definition for `sylvester`: chained usage like `chain(A).sylvester(B, C)` indeed looks a bit odd. It is fine with me not to define this.",
      "Hey @josdejong,\r\nSorry, it took me so long to go through this...\r\n\r\nSo I changed `sylvester`'s definition to match those of [Matlab](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sylvester.html), [Octave](https://octave.sourceforge.io/octave/function/sylvester.html), [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.solve_sylvester.html#scipy.linalg.solve_sylvester) and [Julia](https://andreasvarga.github.io/MatrixEquations.jl). I also changed `lyap`'s definition to match those of [Matlab](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/lyap.html), [Octave](https://octave.sourceforge.io/control/function/lyap.html), and [Julia](https://andreasvarga.github.io/MatrixEquations.jl/dev/lyapunov.html#MatrixEquations.lyapc) ([Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.solve_continuous_lyapunov.html) uses a different one, which I had implemented before, but I'd go with following the majority here, especially Matlab because I think they may have the largest community interested in using these).\r\n\r\nI changed the docs and tests accordingly.

      "Ok that approach makes sense to the two of us but @josdejong has to approve and then it has to be determined whether that's a breaking change that we're going to try to stuff into v11, currently due to be published tomorrow. So it would be great for you to prepare that as long as you're comfortable that it might have to be rolled back or redone if Jos prefers a different approach. If you want to be sure not to make effort that won't be used, you should wait for Jos's thoughts. I am a maintainer but Jos is the founder and architect.",
      "@gwhitney  yes it makes sense to me to see if we can simplify the constructor, it's a bit cluttered indeed and there are more ways to do the same thing than probably needed.\r\n\r\nSo, before this PR, you could create a unit in the following ways:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Unit(null, 'cm') // create a valueless unit \"cm\"\r\nUnit.parse('cm')     // create a valueless unit \"cm\"\r\nnew Unit(5, 'cm')    // create a unit \"5 cm\"\r\nUnit.parse('5 cm')   // create a unit \"5 cm\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand the latest proposal is to replace the second argument to only accept a Unit:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Unit(null, Unit.parse('cm')) // create a valueless unit \"cm\"\r\nUnit.parse('cm')                 // create a valueless unit \"cm\"\r\nnew Unit(5, Unit.parse('cm'))    // create a unit \"5 cm\"\r\nUnit.parse('5 cm')               // create a unit \"5 cm\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNeeding a `Unit` to create a `Unit` feels a bit like a weird circular case. I think ideally, the constructor should contain hardly any logic. Looking at how `Unit.parse` is currently used inside the constructor:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n      const u = Unit.parse(name)\r\n      this.units = u.units\r\n      this.dimensions = u.dimensions\r\n```\r\n\r\nShows though what we actually need under the hood: `value`, `units` and `dimensions`.\r\n\r\nSo, how about changing the constructor to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction Unit (value, units, dimensions) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nEDIT: that makes the constructor less usable in general, but more flexible. For practical use cases you'll need a utility function like `Unit.parse` or `math.unit`, and we can easily add more typical use cases there, like the new idea to be able to create a Unit from a value and a `Unit`.",
      "I definitely like the idea of making the Unit constructor the most semantically straightforward thing -- the \"natural\" way to create a unit. On the other hand, the vector of units and dimensions feels more like the internal representation than the natural specification of a unit. For example, unless I am mistaken, the vector of units and the dimensions have redundant information. I believe the dimensions vector can be determined by the vector of unit objects (add up the powers of each base_unit represented in the vector of units). So it would seem that for constructing, at least you would/should only need to specify the vector of units. My second concern is that the vector of units is in a pretty opaque form: it is an array of objects with keys 'unit', 'prefix', and 'power'; the values for the 'unit' key is an item from the Unit.UNITS object, the 'prefix'  is an item from the 'prefixes' property of the 'unit', and 'power' is an integer. (I don't think a square root of an area unit like an acre is allowed.. ;-)\r\n\r\nIn short, even just the vector of units _might_ be a bit too \"internals\"-ish and cumbersome as a constructor. To actually use it directly, for 3 meters^2 per millisecond, you'd need to write something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnew Unit(3, [{unit: Unit.UNITS.meter, prefix: unit.UNITS.meter.prefixes[''], power: 2},\r\n             {unit: Unit.UNITS.second, prefix: unit.UNITS.second.prefixes.milli, power: -1}])\r\n```\r\nwhich is a bit of a mouthful. Maybe that's OK though, or would it maybe be better to have one inclusive library of prefixes and allow something like:\r\n```\r\nnew Unit(2, [[Unit.UNITS.meter, 2], [Unit.PREFIX.milli, Unit.UNITS.second, -1]])\r\n```\r\n(where the constructor uses a conventional order of: optional prefix, then unit, then power  -- to avoid all those keys, and it can do the work to error-check that the prefixes are actually compatible with the units (i.e. no 'gigaft') and assemble it into its convenient internal rep, reconstructing the dimensions property?)\r\n \r\nIn a slightly related point -- I hesitate to even bring it up at this juncture, so feel free to just completely ignore this question if it doesn't seem reasonable to contemplate at the moment, or seems ridiculous -- would the structure/code/usage here actually be cleaner/simpler if ValuelessUnit were its own class (probably one could find a better name) and then a Unit were simply a pair of a numeric entity and a ValuelessUnit? [I'd be tempted to call them a Unit (which would be the valueless one) and a Quantity (= a numeric value with a Unit), personally.] The points here are that one can delegate the details of specifying a ValuelessUnit to that class (whatever it's called), and then the UnitWithValue constructor takes the quite natural (value, valuelessunit) pair without that smacking of a weird recursion, and it would remove the slightly odd ambiguity as to whether a given Unit instance represents an actual quantity or just a way of measuring such quantities, i.e. in grams. I feel like that current ambiguity leads to a lot of branching in the code that might be unnecessary if the two classes were separated.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, just some thoughts given that the can of worms is at least slightly open; I definitely trust that you will steer a reasonable course here, especially in light of the thought to split off Unit from mathjs, which you probably know more about the state of than we do.",
      "It sounds like some good ideas for discussion. I especially like the distinction between Unit and Quantity!",
      "Thanks for your inputs Glen. Yes I have the same feeling: it will not help opening up too much \"internals\". In the end I hope we can integrate https://github.com/ericman314/UnitMath here, which as a very neat and simple API already.\r\n\r\nAn API like `new Unit(2, [[Unit.UNITS.meter, 2], [Unit.PREFIX.milli, Unit.UNITS.second, -1]])` sounds indeed neat and powerful, that could be something.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is indeed that we now try to represent two different things in the same class: a unit with value and a valueless unit. Great idea to name them `Unit` and `Quantity`, that is a very clear naming. @ericman314 how did you solve and name these things in `UnitMath` again? Is it still an issue there?\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about whether it's worth to make a breaking change in the existing constructor API for this. At this point, I have the feeling we shouldn't over-engineer this. The idea of the PR was to add one more handy way to construct a `Unit`. I like pure, clean API's, and the current Unit constructor could use some improvements. I think refactoring into a separate `Unit` and `Quantity`, or into a neat, proper array with units like Glen idea will be very neat, but this will result in a big refactor, too big for now I think. Ideally, these ideas would be addressed by `UnitMath` in one go. It think it is best at this point to keep the existing code working and extend it with this new option. There is a lot of value in backward compatibility too. And honestly, I do like the practical constructor where you can just pass a string too.\r\n\r\nCan you guys agree to leave the existing behavior as is for the time being?",
      "I've implemented the suggestions from @gwhitney which don't break anything.\r\n\r\nThe `UnitMath` project has a `setValue()` method which \"Returns a copy of this unit but with its value replaced with the given value.\" This could be an alternative to enhancing the constructor but I would have named it `withValue()` which sounds more like it will leave the original object unchanged and return a copy.",
      "Sorry for being late to the discussion. I would love to get UnitMath ready. It's based off of `Unit.js`, the API has been simplified and well documented, and we migrated it to TypeScript. It's hung up on just one or two things relating to making it work with custom units and formats (as in, extending it to work with libraries like Decimal.js, etc). I was very close to getting v1 released--and then life got busy, as they say. I would love to get it integrated with Math.js before the two libraries diverge too much. I think with some help we could get UnitMath v1 released pretty soon.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to help, the place to start is the [v1 branch of UnitMath](https://github.com/ericman314/UnitMath/tree/v1). That has all of the latest changes I and a few others have been working on. If you have time, please check it out. We can definitely implement the Unit from Unit feature there as well.\r\n\r\n",
      "Well, something in the new constructor has borked Unit.multiply. @josdejong, given that the decision is to leave the Unit(value, string) constructor for now, I suggest not waiting to release v11. That way @costerwi can fix this when feasible and merging this won't be a breaking change, so can be in v11.1. I left my review comments alone even though they are moot, as a record of thoughts for the Unit api. But if you want to mark them all resolved instead, go ahead, or I can if you want.",

You will need to keep track of the location of the index at the moment the parser starts parsing a specific type of node. I'm not sure what will be the handiest approach in that regard. Maybe you can create a variable `indexAtStart = ...` at the beginning of all `parse*` functions. Or maybe it works better to create a new state variable holding a stack with start indexes of all the nested operations (a bit similar to keeping track of the `nestingLevel`). "

It indeed feels to me that the rule is still quite specific. In general, I think we would like to extract the constant part from the section inside parenthesis. So maybe a simpler rule is `s: '(n1+c2)/c3 -> (n1/c3)+c2/c3'`. But you have all the variations of what can be inside the parenthesis: `(n1+c2)/c3`, `(n1-c2)/c3`, (n1+n2+c2)/c3, etc. Basically: any constant part inside the numerator of a division. I think we cannot write that as a rule. What we can do is write a function `(node) => node` instead where we match the pattern we're looking for ourselves by looking at the expression tree ([see docs](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/expression_trees.html)). What do you think?",

It kind of seems to me like something that has to be determined on a case by case basis depending on the data contents of a certain type of node (as you say).\r\n\r\nI wonder if maybe there shouldn't even be a base implementation on `Node` and we instead each node type has to define their own `equals` fn which makes sense for it?",
      "Should I close this and we discuss it further in a separate issue?",
      "> Should I close this and we discuss it further in a separate issue?\r\n\r\nIt's fine with me to continue the discussion here to keep things in one place.\r\n\r\nInteresting ideas. I do like the current strict and straightforward implementation, there is no ambiguity, and it is robust: no risks to introduce a new property in one of the classes and forgetting to update the equals function accordingly. \r\n\r\nHow about the following approach: we can keep the current, strict behavior. It is possible to attach custom methods to the prototype of Nodes, (like `math.SymbolNode.myCustomTex = ...`, the existing `equals` will work fine with that. If you want to attach custom properties or methods to individual Node instances (like your `a2.toTex = ...`, then strictly speaking the node actually differs from `a1`. If you want less strict behavior, you can always override either the base implementation `Node.prototype.equals`, or override it for one specific class like `SymbolNode.prototype.equals`.",

      "@gwhitney this looks very good 😎 . You've done a _lot_ of tiny little improvements, to many to list them all here, thanks!\r\n\r\nSome small remarks:\r\n\r\n1. The extraction of `createCompareUnits` and `createTrigUnit` is nifty, it resolves a lot of redundant code! I think it can be optimized though: right now we first create a typed-function 'compareUnits' containing a signature `Unit, Unit`, and then strip this signature the typed-function directly to attach it to an other typed-function like `compare.js`. So, creating this temporary typed-function `compareUnits` is redundant, and we could directly attach this signature to the final function instead? Same with `createTrigUnit`. Or do you perfer the current solution because of better readability and being better contained?\r\n2. Can you add an explanatory comment on top of the regex of `identifier` explaining what it matches, and can you add a couple of unit tests for the new type `identifier`?\r\n3. Can you write a unit test for the new method `Unit.valType()`. Also, can you rename it to `Unit.valueType()`?\r\n4. Can you write a unit test for the new boolean support of `hasNumericValue`?\r\n5. I see you've refactored the `typeOf` function. I do like this on the one hand (it probably indeed improves performance), but I would like to think it through a bit more:\r\n    - When minifiying&bundling JavaScript, names may be mangled. For example right now I get the following when executing in the JS console of my browser on https://mathjs.org:\r\n        ```js \r\n        console.log(math.unit('5cm').constructor.name) // \"S\" and not \"Unit\"\r\n        ```\r\n      Instead of relying on `.constructor.name`, we could use `.constructor.prototype.type` I think, that property is added by mathjs itself.\r\n    - The new solution also returns \"something\" when you pass an unknown class to it. This is a pro and a con. A con as in: we don't control this and cannot guarantee anything about it. Do you have thoughts about that?\r\n    - `typeOf(...)` can now be inconsistent with say `isSymbolNode(...)` since they don't use the same logic.\r\n    - I have to double check if this can have any security implications. I don't think so but want to be a bit careful with that.\r\n    - Changing `\"Function\"` to `\"function\"` is a breaking change, we should not forget to describe that in the changelog (I don't have preference for one or the other myself)\r\n 6. Can you explain your comment `// I don't understand the Node class hierarchy`? I would like to understand what you mean.\r\n 7. I've added a commit with a bit more of IE11 of cleanup of config and polyfills. I'll also try out if we can upgrade to the latest versions of webpack, karma, and mocha now we got rid of IE11, but will do that in a separate branch.",

      "On 2-4 I will certainly do as requested as soon as I can get to it. Responding to 5-6 will have to wait until I have more time to focus on this. And 7 I don't think there's any action item on my part, sounds good.",

      "On review item (3): renaming valType => valueType. But there are already numerous tests of it in test/unit-tests/type/unit/Unit.test.js.",
      "Review item (6) was not really an action item but a question for me. The point of the comment in src/utils/is.js that \"I don't understand the Node class hierarchy\" is that it shouldn't be necessary to have the special case for isNode; all of the different Node types (are/ought to be) \"official\" JavaScript classes and as such, there should be a way to compute their types \"for free\" without relying on some property that we set up, i.e., based on the name of their constructor. And if they were all defined with current class syntax, I think that would be the case. But they are defined with an older pattern that I am not familiar with, and it seems like the constructor name is just \"Node\" for all the types. So rather than trying to figure out a \"direct\" way to extract the type, I fell back to running the isNode() test and then using the particular data item that the hierarchy set up. But for performance I had wanted to minimize the number of cases and tests that were run on all objects, and maximize the situations in which the type can just be directly extracted. But I punted on that for the Node hierarchy, potentially slowing things down for other types, hence the comment.",
      "Ok that just leaves review item 5, definitely the most complicated of all of them. I will attack tomorrow.",
      "One question on name mangling though: did you try your test on the code in this branch? I added a number of constructs like\r\n```\r\nObject.defineProperty(Unit, 'name', { value: 'Unit' })\r\n```\r\nthat supposedly should disallow such name mangling. They seem to work for me but I agree if they are not reliable we shouldn't use that property. So it would be good to know, if you have a chance to check. Thanks.",
      "> 5. I see you've refactored the `typeOf` function. I do like this on the one hand (it probably indeed improves performance), but I would like to think it through a bit more:\r\n>     * When minifiying&bundling JavaScript, names may be mangled. For example right now I get the following when executing in the JS console of my browser on https://mathjs.org:\r\n>       ```js\r\n>       console.log(math.unit('5cm').constructor.name) // \"S\" and not \"Unit\"\r\n>       ```         \r\n>       Instead of relying on `.constructor.name`, we could use `.constructor.prototype.type` I think, that property is added by mathjs itself.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in my last question, I believe that I have added code to prevent such name mangling, and I believe it is properly tested by the generated/node tests.\r\n\r\n>     * The new solution also returns \"something\" when you pass an unknown class to it. This is a pro and a con. A con as in: we don't control this and cannot guarantee anything about it. Do you have thoughts about that?\r\n\r\nWell, most of the uses of typeOf are for messaging purposes, where I think doing \"something\" on non-mathjs types is completely positive. The next biggest use is for function dispatch on Units (the motivation for the rewrite), where we control the types that go in in the first place, so I don't see a worry. Then there's a similar use in the matrix classes, also not a concern. It's used \"directly\" in the `numeric()` function, which I don't really understand the use case for (also seems to overlap with `math.typed.convert()`) but presuming we can't get rid of it I think it could easily be written without typeOf, but moreover, numeric() only proceeds if the result of typeOf is on a prescribed list. So I don't in the end see a worry there. So overall, I don't see any significant concern about typeOf returning \"fiddleydiddley\" for some non-mathjs entity... If you have a more specific scenario of concern, would be happy to consider more.\r\n\r\n>     * `typeOf(...)` can now be inconsistent with say `isSymbolNode(...)` since they don't use the same logic.\r\n\r\nThis is admittedly not ideal. Actually the Node-family tests currently only rely on the Node classes keeping the \".type\" property in line with the .isXxxNode properties, which presumably they do. And the other .isBlahblah tests could be changed to run through typeOf, or left alone; happy to hear your thoughts. Whether or note we change implementations to be more consistent, we do have tests of all of the .isBlahblah predicates  and that typeOf returns the expected thing on an example instance of each entity, so any discrepancies are likely to be caught... so I am willing to live with this if you are, either with doing what's feasible to align implementations or not. Let me know what you'd like.\r\n\r\n>     * I have to double check if this can have any security implications. I don't think so but want to be a bit careful with that.\r\n\r\nBasically, I think my analysis of the point about returning \"something\" addresses this, too. Yes, a foreign class could spoof any mathjs type, but that was already true with the old typeOf, and none of the uses of typeOf make such spoofing seem particularly harmful.\r\n\r\n>     * Changing `\"Function\"` to `\"function\"` is a breaking change, we should not forget to describe that in the changelog (I don't have preference for one or the other myself)\r\n\r\nWell, it was the only non-object case where typeOf didn't match typeof, which seemed counterintuitive, and it was not much entrenched, so seems worth changing for consistency.\r\n\r\nOK, just let me know what remaining action items you have for me based on your review, and let's get this merged :)",
      "Good to have you back, thanks for the updates :)\r\n\r\n**(1) about constructor.name**\r\n\r\nAhh, now I see what you did, by setting `Object.defineProperty(Unit, 'name', { value: 'Unit' })` for example.

The `if (isNode(x)) return x.type` is just a lazy way such that we do not need to write out a check for every class (the old way) like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (isSymbolNode(x)) return 'SymbolNode'\r\nif (isOperatorNode(x)) return 'OperatorNode'\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIt's just utilizing the fact that *if* a class instance is a Node, *then* we know that it has a `.type` property holding the name so we can just return that directly. There is no hierarchy things going on there.\r\n\r\nWith your new approach, I think the line `if (isNode(x)) return x.type` should be removed from `typeOf`, and instead, every `Node` class (like `SymbolNode`), must also get a fixed `.constructor.name`, just like `Unit` and the other classes. Maybe we should even attach a fixed `.constructor.name` to `BigNumber` too to remove that special case.\r\n\r\n**(3) about inconsistency between say isSymbolNode and typeOf:**\r\n\r\nI think we do not need to worry *too* much here, this code isn't changed often and is well unit tested. I like the idea of letting the `isXXXNode` functions simply call `typeOf()`, but I expect that it would be less performant. Ok just leave it as it is right now, we can always refactor internally if the need arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(4) last action points:**\r\n\r\n1. remove `if (isNode(x)) return x.type` from `typeOf` and give all `Node` classes a fixed `constructor.name` too.\r\n2. not sure, do we want to give Decimal.js class a fixed `.constructor.name = 'BigNumber'` too? It makes sense to me but it also feels ugly to override this name. Currently it's mangled in the minified bundle, so not usable anyway, so I think it will not do harm\r\n3. I think it would be good to add some unit tests to `test/node-tests/browser.test.js`, where we can load the bundled+minified file to make sure `typeOf` works also after minifying.\r\n",
      "Thanks for the feedback!\r\n1. I will try to do this (as I said, I don't really understand the sort-of \"by hand\" class definition style of the Node hierarchy ;-)\r\n2. Decimal and BigNumber are third-party libraries, right? It doesn't feel right to be modifying them. If you'd like to file an issue upstream with them, feel free, but I'd prefer depending on their existing APIs rather than modifying class internals in the meantime. One special case isn't crushing to typeOf's performance. If you get BigNumber to conform in the future, we can always eliminate the case...\r\n3. I thought I did this but I will check and add the tests if not or extend them if I didn't cover all the cases, esp Nodes and BigNumbers.",
      "1. 😂 \r\n2. yeah ok. Let's leave the BigNumber check as it is then 👍 \r\n3. 👍  could be they are already there, I didn't see them but maybe I overlooked this",
      "I know you found my response to (1) humorous, but really, I am very confused with all the prototypes floating around in the Node class hierarchy and explicitly setting the prototypes and the properties on them. Is there a reason mathjs can't use current class definition syntax? Is it OK if I try?",
      "Sorry. I think that I didn't fully understand you. The \"by hand\" class definition with a function constructor and then methods and props under `.prototype` was just the normal way of doing \"classes\" in JavaScript before `class` existed. The only reason it's written like that is that `class` didn't exist when I created the code. It would be very nice to rewrite it to `class` indeed, though in the end it's mostly eye-candy I think, but a good improvement. It may be good to address it separately from this PR to prevent this PR from never finishing.",

      "Yeah, well, I did warn you. Despite numerous tries, I couldn't figure out where/how to assign properties in the derived Node classes to get the \"standard\" typeOf implementation to produce the correct result, so I just went ahead and converted to class syntax and as expected typeOf() then works perfectly on all of the Node classes. It makes the diff in the latest commit huge though, I am afraid.\r\n\r\nAs for testing, it turns out that it's the doc test on the documentation of the typeOf function that was checking a lot of cases (hurray for doc testing) so I just went ahead and extended that documentation page to include all of the relevant types. And note\r\nthat the doc tests are all done in node on the resulting bundle, so it constitutes a node test as desired. However, I am not sure that will match the browser tests, so looking forward to the output of the current round of tests on GitHub. Once those are all passing, I will rebase for the umpteenth time...",
      "Oh, excellent, all GitHub tests have passed. Rebasing now...",
      "OK, fortunately the rebase had no conflicts and it is force-pushed and passes all tests. Speaking of tests, has mathjs dropped Node 12 support? If so, I see in the commit history of this PR that at some point we switched `options && options.implicit` to `options?.implicit` and then we switched back because the latter broke on Node 12. So should I now switch those occurrences back to `options?.implicit` ??\r\n\r\nThanks for letting me know. If not, I hope this can be merged, it's been quite the saga (sorry that several of my other projects and the end of the semester really dragged it out).\r\n",
      "Oops I see we have not yet merged the no breaking chain parameters PR into this one yet. I guess there is one remaining review comment in #2559. I will rebase that PR and address that comment. Definitely want to get this done with.",
      "OK, #2559 is back in good shape and should be merged here before this is merged into develop. Other than the question of implementing #2617 (which I am personally against) I believe everything is ready for merge into develop and release of v11. If you need help writing a release notes to facilitate that -- this is definitely the most major change in a while -- just let me know and I am happy to help.",
      "Thanks, let's go all in then with the class rewrite 😄 \r\n\r\n> I couldn't figure out where/how to assign properties in the derived Node classes to get the \"standard\" typeOf implementation to produce the correct result\r\n\r\nI think you figured that out before: in `Unit.js` for example, where you added the first two lines of to make `typeOf` work:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nObject.defineProperty(Unit, 'name', { value: 'Unit' })\r\nUnit.prototype.constructor = Unit\r\nUnit.prototype.type = 'Unit'\r\nUnit.prototype.isUnit = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith classes we can write it as follows:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstatic name = 'OperatorNode'\r\nget type () { return 'OperatorNode' }\r\nget isOperatorNode () { return true }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added unit tests to test `typeOf` on the bundle, they are currently failing, and can be fixed with the above definition of name. (on a side note: this should not conflict with the `.name` property that `SymbolNode` and `FunctionNode` instances use too, though it is a bit confusing). Can you make the unit tests pass by adding static, fixed class names?\r\n",

With this approach:\r\n\r\n- Everything is enforced through ESLint. So:\r\n    - Good IDE support (e.g., in VSCode, you'd just need the ESLint extension)\r\n    - There's still just `npm run lint` and `npm run lint -- --fix`.\r\n- Small diff, because source code and tests still following StandardJS\r\n- Good maintence:\r\n    - StandardJS seems reasonably maintained for JS files _And the StandardJS CLI uses ESLint under the hood, so I imagine any updates to StandardJS **have to** go through their ESLint config, though I'm not 100% sure._\r\n    - Prettier is definitely well maintained\r\n- We can tweak Prettier's config a little bit. It's not very configurable, but we can tell it to use \"no semicolons\" and \"single quotes\", which keeps the TS formatting style fairly similar to the JS formatting style. ",

And now as I said I will step out of the way and let you iron it all out.",

In some places (e.g., converting multiline objects to single line) I agree with you but would prefer to leave it out of this PR. Or potentially do it as a last commit in this PR, but I'd rather make as few manual changes as possible in case we end up closing this in favor of a 4th linting PR",
      "Well, as I've said, this sort of thing is not really my forte, so my comments were meant just as my uninformed impressions/reactions, in case those were helpful to the discussion between you and Jos. So it's extremely kind of you to go through them in such detail. I will therefore limit myself to just two small further responses to this round of discussion:\r\n1) The comment to the @ts-expect-error should explain why there's intended to be a _compile-time_ error, something along the lines of  \"... ensure that round(array, array) will not type\" . Then it's not clear to me there needs to be a comment about the runtime error, since the assert.throws self-documents that.\r\n2) I totally sympathize with not wanting to make a bunch of changes in case yet a different linting PR is pursued. But when the \"one true linting PR\" is selected, it seems to me that that PR is actually a _good_ place for other purely whitespace changes for layout readability, like \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  L,\r\n  U\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbecomes `{ L, U }`, since they are in the same spirit and one gets over the pain of voluminous whitespace-only changes in a single go, like ripping the band-aid off all at once minimizing the total pain.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to getting through this :)\r\n",

And there aren't too many. It's possible I missed a few, but I believe all two-element and three-element objects are now on a single line, if they fit. My 2c would be it's probably not worth trying to enforce this on PRs, though: If linting conventions aren't enforceable by CI, they're probably a lost cause.",
      "> My 2c would be it's probably not worth trying to enforce this on PRs,\r\n\r\nI for one totally agree. I am a believer that it's actually best to allow some latitude in layout to the judgment of the coder, because different circumstances call for different emphasis, etc. I think the recent drive to have one automated way to lay out any given section of code is a bit overkill/misguided.",

      "Thanks @ChristopherChudzicki for working this out! That is a huge amount of work!\r\n\r\nI'm glad that the code style is mostly the same as before (all of the changes in #2541 would be bit too much indeed 😅). The only left over changes make sense to me: replacing `{ key: key }` with `{ key }`, and it's fine with me to replace arrow functions with regular functions in tests. \r\n\r\nThe tests fail because of an issue with the git url of `eslint-config-standard-with-typescript`. I would love to get that resolved. Links to a github repo as npm dependency is ok with me temporarily during development, but not acceptable for production. I'm a bit worried though whether `eslint-config-standard-with-typescript` will be released any time soon (last release was 8 months ago). What do you think, shall we just wait for a couple of days, and if not, come up with an alternative solution? \r\n\r\n@gwhitney the `{ key: key }` replacement will not be an issue: when creating an ES5 compatible bundle, this will be replaced again by the transpilation done by Babel. We should put that transpilation in place in `typed-function` too, so we can finally use modern JS with all these niceties like `{ key }`.",
      "> I'm a bit worried though whether eslint-config-standard-with-typescript will be released any time soon (last release was 8 months ago).\r\n\r\n@josdejong I think that's definitely a concern. Even if they release a new npm version from current master within the next week or so, how well will it be maintained with future releases of the peer dependencies? And there are [5 peerDependencies](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript/blob/master/package.json#L59-L66) with non-* versions. So I think this is a real concern.\r\n\r\nIn general, it seems to me that StandardJS's support for typescript is not great. The support is better when using StandardJS configs through ESLint rather than the StandrdJS CLI, but still not particularly good, as we're seeing with [eslint-config-standard-with-typescript](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript). (Aside: their CLI support still has a [peer dependency of Typescript 3.](https://github.com/standard/ts-standard/blob/master/package.json#L96). TS 4 was released 2 years ago.)\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/2488#issuecomment-1073914123\r\n> I do think we should have a single linting setup for the whole repo though, and not something different for the plain JS vs the TypeScript definitions. Would it make sense to completely replace StandardJS with ESLint+Prettier and configure it correctly (and consistent) for both JS and TS?\r\n\r\nI think there are conflicting goals:\r\n1. similar standards for TS files and JS files\r\n2. well supported libraries\r\n3. small diff\r\n\r\nI think we can basically get any two but not all three: (1) and (2) mean dropping StandardJS, which implies a big diff, probably not too dissimilar from that in #2541. \r\n\r\nBut I think we could skirt (1) reasonably.  @josdejong, what would you think of using an ESLint config along the lines of\r\n```js\r\n// for js (and a variant with 'plugin:mocha/recommended' for js tests)\r\n    extends: ['standard']\r\n// for typescript\r\n    extends: [\r\n        'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',\r\n        'plugin:prettier/recommended'\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\nThis would be sort of separate setups for TS and JS. But\r\n- Everything is enforced through ESLint. So:\r\n    - Good IDE support (e.g., in VSCode, you'd just need the ESLint extension)\r\n    - There's still just `npm run lint` and `npm run lint -- --fix`.\r\n- Small diff, because source code and tests still following StandardJS\r\n- Good maintence:\r\n    - StandardJS seems reasonably maintained for JS files _And the StandardJS CLI uses ESLint under the hood, so I imagine any updates to StandardJS **have to** go through their ESLint config, though I'm not 100% sure._\r\n    - Prettier is definitely well maintained\r\n- We can tweak Prettier's config a little bit. It's not very configurable, but we can tell it to use \"no semicolons\" and \"single quotes\", which keeps the TS formatting style fairly similar to the JS formatting style. \r\n\r\nIMO, ☝️ is probably the sweet spot of effort / maintenance / git history. @josdejong What do you think?",
      "That makes a lot of sense, good idea. Right now we do not have TypeScript code in the project except for the type definitions. So I think it's ok if the TS code style is not exactly the same as the JS code style. Makes sense to take that approach as the first step.\r\n\r\nIn another future step we may want to move towards \"eslint\" defaults and away from \"standardjs\". But since that will be a huge change breaking all open PR's and branches, let's only do that if there is real need for it and then plan it smartly.",

    "body": "### What are the associated issues?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/2488\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nCurrently MathJS uses the StandardJS CLI for linting. This PR updates MathJS to use ESLint with `eslint-config-standard` (for linting code quality) and Prettier (for formatting). The immediate motivation is to extend linting to the Typescript files since the Standard CLI does not support TS well. See https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/2488#issuecomment-1073369323 for more.\r\n\r\n**Linters vs Formatters:**  Generally, \"Linters\" analyze the AST and make local changes. \"Formatters\" analyze the AST and re-print it entirely new in a standardized format. So formatters guarantee a unique representation of the AST in a text file. When to lint and when to format? [Prettier says...](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html):\r\n\r\n> Linters have two categories of rules:\r\n> - **Formatting rules**: eg: [max-len](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-len), [no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs), [keyword-spacing](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/keyword-spacing), [comma-style](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-style)…\r\n> - **Code-quality rules**: eg [no-unused-vars](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unused-vars), [no-extra-bind](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-extra-bind), [no-implicit-globals](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-implicit-globals), [prefer-promise-reject-errors](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-promise-reject-errors)…\r\n\r\nNice things about using Prettier for formatting:\r\n- it's single-purpose: Just formatting. \"Quality\" decisions can be made independently (e.g., MathJS could switch to Airbnb or some other style guide and still use prettier)\r\n- Supports typescript nicely\r\n- Very nice IDE integration (although I suggest we run it through via ESLint through `eslint-plugin-prettier`, so the IDE integration is really eslint)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nAutomated tests should pass. Try out IDE support in js + ts, e.g., with [VSCode ESLint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).\r\n\r\n### History / Merge conflict concerns\r\nUsing Prettier on `src/` did cause a huge number of changes. (Opinion: good changes!). Unfortunately, that does mess up the git history a little bit. I suspect that's acceptable. We knew that in discussion of #2488.\r\n\r\nI fully expect that this PR is going to have merge conflicts as other stuff is merged into `develop`. That's fine. I'm happy to resolve them. (And resolution should be fairly easy. The `src/` directory required almost no manual changes.)\r\n\r\nMore annoying is merge conflicts in **other people**'s PRs. I think with a git surgery, merge conflicts in other people's PRs can be almost automatically resolved. See [COMMENT I AM IN THER PROCESS OF WRITING]",

I think we can resolve them almost automatically through the following process. (I've tested this with `feat--fast-fourier-transform-backup`; everything went smoothly.)\r\n\r\n1. Check out your feature branch locally. I'll use `feat--fast-fourier-transform` from https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/2540 as an example.\r\n2. Create a backup of your branch, just in case:\r\n    ```\r\n    git checkout -b feat--fast-fourier-transform-backup\r\n    ```\r\n3. Get a copy of `[ChristopherChudzicki:linting-rules-only](https://github.com/ChristopherChudzicki/mathjs/tree/linting-rules-only)` locally. This branch contains the same updates to `package.json`, `.eslintrc`, etc as this PR, **without** any changes to src/, test/, or types/.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    # Get linting-rules-only locally\r\n    git remote add cc https://github.com/ChristopherChudzicki/mathjs.git\t# add my repo as a remote\r\n    git fetch cc\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# fetch\r\n    git checkout cc/linting-rules-only \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# this will be in \"detached head mode\"\r\n    git switch -c linting-rules-only\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# now you have a real copy of linting-rules-only\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Checkout your feature branch again and merge `linting-rules-only` into it. There should be no conflicts unless you've modified package.json, too.\r\n    ```\r\n    git checkout feat--fast-fourier-transform\r\n    git merge cc/linting-rules-only\r\n    ```\r\n5. Install new linting dependencies: `npm install`\r\n6. Generate a list of filenames that have been changed on your branch:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    git diff --name-only linting-rules-only\r\n    ```\r\n\t\r\n\tCopy the affected files to a space-separated list.\r\n7. Using the space-separated file list from above, lint+fix **just those files**. For `feat--fast-fourier-transform`, that looks like\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    npx eslint --fix src/expression/embeddedDocs/embeddedDocs.js src/expression/embeddedDocs/function/matrix/fft.js src/expression/embeddedDocs/function/matrix/ifft.js src/factoriesAny.js src/function/matrix/fft.js src/function/matrix/ifft.js test/unit-tests/function/matrix/fft.test.js test/unit-tests/function/matrix/ifft.test.js\r\n    ```\r\n8. Commit the changes\r\n    ```\r\n    git add *\r\n    git commit -m \"linted\"\r\n    ```\r\n9. Checkout `develop` and create a new branch, merging your linted branch into it: *If this PR has not been merged yet, replace `develop` with a copy of this PR's branch.*)\r\n   ```\r\n   git checkout develop\r\n   git checkout -b feat--fast-fourier-transform-new\r\n   git merge feat--fast-fourier-transform\r\n   ```\r\n10. Rejoice. You now have a branch called `feat--fast-fourier-transform-new` which has all your changes and is up-to-date with dev.\r\n",
      "@ChristopherChudzicki thanks so much for pursuing this!\r\n\r\nBut, well, 909 source files changed is way out of my league on this project; this is going to have to be a discussion between you and @josdejong (who did say in #2488 that he'd prefer to avoid wholesale changes to the code). So I will just give my opinions for the two of you to consider as you reach some conclusion on this direction:\r\n\r\n* Why does a \"hobbyist\" project like mathjs need a formatter in addition to a linter? I understand the use of a formatter in a commercial project, to save time of staff making lots of code changes continuously, but I don't see the use case for a project like this that consists mostly of minor \"casual\" contributions -- if we have code format standards that are enforced by a linter on all PRs, the code base will remain consistent format-wise, and individual contributors can navigate how it's most efficient for them to ensure they satisfy the linter (if they're doing enough work on mathjs for it to even matter)?\r\n\r\n* Regardless of whether it's just a linter or a linter and formatter, it seems to me that it could (and should!) be \"tuned\" closer to mathjs's current format. For example, many of the individual changes in this PR are the addition of \"final comma\" in literal objects and arrays. How much would it reduce the count of files changed if this was set back to \"no final comma\"? Similarly, numerous changes come from eliminating the space that mathjs puts between the function name and argument list in the definition of a function. While I am not at all a fan of that space (in fact I kind of despise it), I totally don't see the value in eliminating all occurrences of it. I strongly suspect that these two items, and whatever line-length setting you/Prettier happened to choose, and possibly a tiny number of other format aspects, account for the **vast** bulk of the proposed source changes. Why is this worth it? I think that by mildly tuning the linting (and the formatting if that's kept), the number of changes for compliance could be reduced to just a handful.\r\n\r\n* I do understand that Prettier is notoriously and deliberately non-configurable. So be it, that's their choice; a project like mathjs long pre-existing it can then make a choice whether or not to adopt it. There are alternatives that are more configurable, such as `eslint` itself in its `--fix` mode (which would have the advantage of then automatically complying with whichever parameters we set for using eslint as the linter). Or, it's fine to switch linters now to include typescript, using a tuning that is fine or almost fine with the code base as it stands, and then implement a formatter later that will not disrupt the code greatly, as time and motivation permits.\r\n\r\nAll right, there's my two cents and I will let you all resolve how to proceed here. Thanks again for the efforts!",
      "@gwhitney I'm going to close this PR... I think you're right, prettier is a bad idea for mathjs right now because of the big diff.\r\n\r\nI originally pursued Prettier because it can format typescript nicely for us and [`eslint-config-standard-with-typescript`](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript) had not been updated to support ESLint 8. But... it was updated 4 days ago. I'll open a new PR shortly with a smaller diff.\r\n\r\nBut... fyi, re:\r\n\r\n    > There are alternatives that are more configurable, such as eslint itself in its --fix mode (which would have the advantage of then automatically complying with whichever parameters we set for using eslint as the linter). \r\n\r\n    With the setup of this PR, all mathjs linting would be enforced through eslint, with many rules automatically fixable by `eslint --fix`. (ESLint would use prettier to enforce formatting related rules, but thats really an implementation detail that contributors don't care about, unless they needed to modify linting settings).\r\n"

      "Oh! Apparently I didn't read the biog post carefully enough, there might be a better / simpler way to do this by overloading `this`: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13852. Will create a branch off this one using that method so we can compare",
      "Yeah, way better I think: https://github.com/goodproblems/mathjs/pull/1/files",
      "That sounds really promising. It will be a large amount of work to work this out I think, but it it will be very nice that the type definitions will be exact.\r\n\r\nIf I understand it correctly, to correctly define a new function which can return type A, B, or C, the function needs to be added to the chain interfaces for type A, B, and C?

      "I think this second method will also be a lot simpler to migrate to, and am happy to do a fair bit of that (I might ask for some help writing the tests, docs, etc though).",
      "I think, but I am not certain, that Jos was worried about the case of a function that has three possible return types.

But I imagine for that you just need three overloads, one with each of the possibilities for the input types and returning the respective templated version of MathJsChain<> ?\r\n\r\nAh, yes I think to start we could just mirror each of the existing function overloads as chainable function overloads for now. In the future, it may be possible to automatically infer the types of the chainable functions using some tricky typescript utility types instead of duplicating the args, return values, etc. However, to keep it simple I say we stick with the version I've just pushed for now and live with the duplication.",
      "> Instead of needing a subtype of `MathJSChain` for each possible chainable value as in my first method, we can instead simply overload the `this` property type of each chainable function and pass `MathJSChain` with the appropriate generic type\r\n\r\nAhhh, so if I understand it correctly, for every function we need to define 1 line inside `interface MathJsChain<TValue> { ... }`, like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface MathJsChain<TValue> {\r\n  myFunction(this: MathJsChain<...input types>, arg2: ..., arg3: ...): MathJsChain<...output types...>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo this type definition will be about exactly the same as the static version of the function: only the first argument is replaced with `this`. That is really a perfect solution 😎 👍 ",
      "> Ahhh, so if I understand it correctly, for every function we need to define 1 line inside interface MathJsChain<TValue> { ... }\r\n\r\nExactly! \r\n\r\n>So this type definition will be about exactly the same as the static version of the function: only the first argument is replaced with this. That is really a perfect solution 😎 👍\r\n\r\nYep, pleasant surprise 😃\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm wondering though (if we go through with my proposal) is whether we might consider splitting up the giant `types/index.d.ts` into smaller files with static and chain types colocated as we go? I'm finding it pretty hard to navigate as-is, and I think the risk of types between `MathJsStatic` and `MathJsChain` getting out of sync is fairly high.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n#### **`types/type/bignumber.d.ts`**\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Decimal } from 'decimal.js'\r\n\r\ndeclare namespace math {\r\n  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface\r\n  interface BigNumber extends Decimal {}\r\n\r\n  interface MathJsStatic {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Create a BigNumber, which can store numbers with arbitrary precision.\r\n     * When a matrix is provided, all elements will be converted to\r\n     * BigNumber.\r\n     * @param x Value for the big number, 0 by default.\r\n     * @returns The created bignumber\r\n     */\r\n    bignumber(\r\n      x?: number | string | Fraction | BigNumber | boolean | Fraction | null\r\n    ): BigNumber\r\n    bignumber<T extends MathCollection>(x: T): T\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  interface MathJsChain<TValue extends number | string | Fraction | BigNumber | boolean | Fraction | null | MathCollection> {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Create a BigNumber, which can store numbers with arbitrary precision.\r\n     * When a matrix is provided, all elements will be converted to\r\n     * BigNumber.\r\n     */\r\n    bignumber(\r\n      this: MathJsChain<number | string | Fraction | BigNumber | boolean | Fraction | null>,\r\n    ): MathJsChain<BigNumber>\r\n    bignumber<T extends MathCollection>(this: MathJsChain<T>): MathJsChain<T>\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe advantages I see are:\r\n- It'll be easier to keep track of which functions have had their chain version migrated\r\n- It'll be easier to navigate in general\r\n- It'll be easier to ensure the static and chain version of a function have the correct types, docs, etc",
      "I'm all for splitting, I just wasn't clear on the technical mechanism for doing so, but if it's straightforward, I would recommend it. However, I'd suggest rather than one file per function (that's like 200-ish files!) an intermediate division like one file per subdirectory of src/ is tried first.\r\n",

I'm not sure though what is the best plan to get there. Since it is a large amount of work it may be handy if we could split it in multiple smaller steps. Do you see possibilities there, or do you think it is handiest to refactor all of it in one go in this PR?",

      "Looks fine to me. I frankly did not know about `end` until seeing the associated issue. But this seems to work well. My only comments are not directly related to this change: \r\n\r\n1) When 'end' occurs inside an accessor to an object, a somewhat strange error is thrown. I am not surprised it's a runtime exception, as I am not sure what `end` would mean (although I suppose it could mean the last key in the order JavaScript presents them in `Object.keys()`) but it might be clearer if the message were something like \"`end` only valid in array/matrix indices.\" \r\n\r\n2) In nested indexing `a[b[end]]` the `end` of course means the last index of `b`, as it should, but there is no way of getting the last index of `a` in the innermost context. Not sure that you would want/need a way (I mean, you can already write `a[b[size(a)[1]]]`) but perhaps this should be pointed out in the documentation somewhere and/or be tested in a unit test. \r\n\r\nThe two points interact slightly in that if I set `a`  to `[-1,-2,-3]` and `b` to `{3:2}` I half expected `a[b[end]]` to produce -2, in that I thought object indexing would not set \"end\" so the \"end\" value from array-indexing `a` would still be valid in the inner context and be used as the key for `b` to produce 2, which would then be used to index `a`.\r\n\r\nNot sure it would make any sense to address these points here; but they also seemed so minor that I wasn't sure they were even worth opening an issue for; so I thought I would just compromise and mention them here to see if you thought they were worth doing anything about and if so in what context (as additions to this PR or somewhere separate).",
      "I don't recall seeing [end] in the documentation, I just tested something similar to what [Matlab/Octave does](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/object-end-indexing.html) and also found that it was being used on [Rocket trajectory optimization](https://mathjs.org/examples/browser/rocket_trajectory_optimization.html.html)\r\n\r\nMaybe another issue would be to add the [end] indexing into the documentation for [matrices](https://mathjs.org/docs/datatypes/matrices.html).

      "My only concern is that this will lead to a lot more updates to the AUTHORS file: as people submit more PRs, they will start to climb up the rankings, leading to a change to AUTHORS each time.\r\n\r\nA suggestion: since AUTHORS is being tracked in the repo as a primary file, and so when the script runs there is always guaranteed to be an existing AUTHORS file, why not have the script just add any new authors it finds to the file (in whatever order), otherwise leaving it alone? Then the order just becomes the order in which something a person committed was merged, and the file only gets changed when there is a new author, and presumably with a loose enough \"already there\" check, it won't try to re-add HanchaiN under the undesired email address (or if it does we could always just have a hard-coded \"ignore these authors\" check in the script).",
      "Yes you're right. The reordering will not be nice. Thinking about this approach again it's not really a solution, it \"accidentally\" works because of not taking co-authors into account. So let's at least not go for this approach (#2533).\r\n\r\nInteresting idea to change the script to (optionally) only append new names instead of replacing the full file. I generally like scripts that can just regenerate all, instead of append based on recent changes or so, the latter is often more fragile. I'm not sure how to implement this in an easy and reliable way though. Something like only run over commits after the last commit that the AUTHORS file itself was updated with or so. It also feels like overkill to me to put this effort in just to fix a single author.\r\n\r\nA list with ignored authors would be _very_ easy to implement though. @DIVYA-19 would that be an acceptable solution to you? It would mean the very email address we try to remove is removed from `AUTHORS` but will be added in the `./tools/generate-authors.js` script.\r\n\r\n",

      "Well, ideally someone familiar with the code like @yifanwww would determine what is going wrong on IE11 -- presumably it is poorer precision on one of the builtin functions (?) -- and we would replace that weak link for IE11 with our own implementation that has the proper accuracy. In the meantime, I have no objection to this hack, especially as IE11 is near end-of-life and has very tiny browser share at this point.",
      "Yes indeed. Let's be careful though not to spend _too_ much time on getting this working on IE11 - it's a very old browser.",
      "Unfortunately, I cannot open IE11 on my windows 11 system. Windows 11 has fully removed internet explorer, I can only run IE Mode in Microsoft Edge browser, and in IE Mode mathjs computes the correct result.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe, I cannot find out the reason.",
      "Well, there's definitely some way to do it with BrowserStack. @josdejong enabled me to use it, but I must admit I have not really absorbed how to employ it properly. Perhaps he can shed some light...",
      "Glen and me can use BrowserStack to test on IE11 indeed, but besides that hard to test on IE11. There seems to be an IE11 mode in Edge, [read here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/edge-ie-mode). To debug this, the easiest is probably to create a minimal index.html where you copy-paste the code of the complex implementation of `lgamma` and a single test inside a script tag, and open that in IE mode of Edge to see what comes out.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I prefer not spending effort on IE11. I just checked out the end-of-life for IE11. I cannot find a very definitive answer to that, but [this official MS blog states](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/05/19/the-future-of-internet-explorer-on-windows-10-is-in-microsoft-edge/):\r\n\r\n> the Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be retired and go out of support on June 15, 2022, for certain versions of Windows 10.\r\n\r\nIf OK with you guys, I would like to drop official support for IE11 at June 15, 2022. That doesn't mean the library suddenly doesn't work on IE11 anymore or so, but we'll not spend effort fixing anything that doesn't work on IE11. If future versions of mathjs do not work on IE11, you'll have to stick to an older version of mathjs or fix things yourself. What do you think?\r\n\r\nFor the time being I'll merge this PR in order to have a stable `develop` branch.",

The result is the same as that in nodejs. So I think Edge IE Mode uses a different Math lib than IE11.",
      "Ah, yeah good point.\r\n\r\nI've merged this PR but the same test still fails, which is odd. I'm doing some debugging on it.",
      "> So I think Edge IE Mode uses a different Math lib than IE11.\r\n\r\nHm so we can't use IE Mode in Edge for the unit tests on IE11, that's a pity.",

And yes, I totally support on June 15 doing a release that passes everything on IE 11, and then clearly labeling/documenting it as the last official IE 11-supporting release, and from there on simply removing consideration/testing of IE 11 from the future development path of mathjs (and typed-function). There are quite several things it will be easier/possible to implement without having to worry about a very old browser that does not support many recent JavaScript updates.",

And are there other things that you want to address?\r\n\r\n@gwhitney do you have any inputs on this PR?",

      "Currently, those tests exist (Line 72, 81 of `pinv.test.js`). Still, other algorithms may be needed to pass those tests and make them ready for review.",

      "This is starting to really shape up, thanks! I haven't looked it over in detail yet, but a few things first:\r\n\r\n1) The default accuracy of approx.deepEqual is very mild -- only 0.0001 -- so please see how small an EPSILON you can use in all of the approx calls and still get a pass; hopefully it is something much smaller.\r\n2) Please don't just turn off your very nice checks that pinv gives a valid pinv when a target pinv is supplied in the test. Instead, please leave them in, and to deal with the fact that you get non-matching almost-zeros in symmetric locations, in just the Hermitian tests add 1 to all entries on both sides (with math.add(..., 1)) before testing approx.deepEqual. That will swamp the difference in the tiny zeros. (In the complex case as in the next item, you _might_ have to add 1+i instead of just 1, but try with just 1 first.)\r\n3) Your pinv claims to handle complex entries in the argument matrix, but there are no tests of this case; please add some. \r\n4) Perhaps you should also add a much larger nonsquare matrix with entries you simply choose at will or generate in some crazy way, and test it without the target pinv, just to make sure it is returning a valid pseudoinverse for a more hefty example (since that's one of the main applications).\r\n\r\nThanks!

      "I'm done with .ts test case",

      "My attempt to fix test case. I thought it just test the type definition so I don't care if the function can be actually executed.\r\nIt turn out that this is not the case. It actually trying to calculate variance/std on number then it thought that the second argument is variadic parameter.\r\n\r\nFor example: `math.chain([1, 2, 3]).std(\"biased\").std(\"unbiased\")` will cause such error. \r\nThe error message is misleading thought but I guess that can't be help when the actual execution is done from JS side.",
      "There is still an inconsistency between the types for the \"direct\" math.std and math.variance and the \"chain\" .std and .variance. Specifically, the following works in plain JavaScript:\r\n\r\n`math.chain(2).std(3,3,4)`\r\n\r\nand it produces exactly the same results as `math.std(2,3,3,4)` because that's just the way that \"chains\" work.\r\nHowever, although the latter works fine in TypeScript, the former currently fails to type with an `Expected 0-2 arguments, but got 3.` error.\r\n\r\nNow because this would be an odd use of a chain (although entirely legitimate by current rules), I am not sure exactly the best resolution and perhaps @josdejong should weigh in. Some possibilities are:\r\n1) Add the signatures in `types/index.d.ts` that will make this odd sort of chain that works in JavaScript type correctly in TypeScript, basically a `std(...values: number[]): MathJsChain` (and one for variance, and also corresponding tests). Not sure whether or not that will improve the error messages you mention, which I agree can be confusing.\r\n2) Conclude that the fact that you can in effect split a 'rest' parameter between the initial `chain()` call and the subsequent command in the chain is just an undesirable side effect of how chains work in JavaScript and so we don't actually want to allow it in TypeScript. In that case, possibly this PR could be tweaked to improve the error messages that come up in TypeScript in various cases of trying to do this questionable thing, or maybe that's not necessary. If this tweaking is desired, then it would be ideal for `test:types` to verify that the desired errors are generated, but that would definitely involve re-engineering the test to have additional source files since right now definitely `types/index.ts` can't have any compilation errors, only runtime errors that are caught and checked.\r\n3) Decide that the current \"splitting rest parameters\" behavior is sufficiently weird that not only do we not want to allow it in TypeScript, but we'd prefer to actually prevent it altogether,  and so the chain facility on the JavaScript side should be amended so that `math.chain(2).std(3,3,4)` won't actually be interpreted as `math.std(2,3,3,4)` (but will issue some easily understood error).\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on which alternative is best or on whether there are other options are welcome.",
      "Thanks @NattapongSiri for this PR, appreciated 👍 \r\n\r\nTo me, splitting rest parameters in a chained call, like `math.chain(2).std(3,3,4)`, is something we should not want/do in practice. So I would say let's just make sure it's not supported in the TypeScript definitions: that is option (3) of the ideas of @gwhitney. Does that make sense @NattapongSiri, @gwhitney ?",
      "OK, so to be clear, option (3) was the one in which I proposed we completely disable `math.chain(2).std(3,3,4)` from meaning `math.std(2,3,3,4)` even just in pure-JavaScript use of mathjs. Is that the preferred direction to go here? That's a much more extensive change than just what's in this PR (which affects TypeScript only), and it's a breaking change to mathjs. So in this case perhaps we'd want to (a) accept/merge this PR, since it would then be compatible with the planned behavior for javascript mathjs, (b) file a separate issue that such \"split rests\" should not be allowed by chain, and (c) work up a PR that resolves the new issue in time for v11? If so I am happy to work or collaborate on some/all of (a),(b),(c) but just wanted to make sure everyone is on the same page before I embarked.",
      "hm, yeah, to be consistent we should not allow that in plain JavaScript either, but that would be serious work 🤔\r\n\r\nHere is my reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. Splitting rest parameters like in `math.chain(2).std(3,3,4)` is not something you need in practice, so it is OK with me to drop support for it\r\n2. It also doesn't do harm if it _does_ work\r\n3. We do want the TypeScript definitions to be consistent with the actual plain JavaScript behavior\r\n4. So let's choose what is the least amount of work\r\n\r\nGlen's option (3) that I mentioned before (https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/pull/2474#issuecomment-1068176869) requires changing both JS behavior and TS definitions, so this is much work. So if \"just\" changing the TypeScript definitions to be aligned with the actual JS behavior is little work, I think that is the better option after all (Glen's option (1)).",
      "Well, just to quantify things, here's the path I see for implementing the JavaScript side of \"option (3)\":\r\n\r\nA) In typed-function, expose a function `typed.isTypedFunction(x)` (well, or use the one already in `import.js` but really it ought to come from typed-function and import should be changed to use that).\r\n\r\nB) In typed-function, expose a function `typed.resolve(fn: typedFunction, argList: Array.<any>)` that returns the object with the specific signature and implementation function that the call `fn(argList[0], argList[1], ...)` would reach. [Note that neither A or B is a breaking change to typed-function, so that's convenient.]\r\n\r\nC) In `chainify` in `Chain.js`, if there are any arguments in the latest call, rather than just applying fn to the args, instead call the \"resolve\" function from part (B). If it returns a signature that consists entirely of a single rest parameter, issue an error message that a rest parameter may not be split across a chain() constructor and a subsequent call; otherwise, apply the returned implementation function to the  assembled argument list.\r\n\r\nThat's all. So that doesn't really seem like _al_l that much work to me -- happy to do it if you like. So please just let us know. If you want to do \"option (1)\" then @NattapongSiri  would need to add another overload to the chain version of each of std() and variance().\r\n\r\nI do totally respect the principle of keeping JavaScript and TypeScript in sync, i.e. discarding \"option (2)\". I just threw that out as a logical possibility.",
      "It's ok whichever choice you made. To me, change to typescript only need few keystroke.\r\nSo my opinion is that I can make a change to accept a use case like `Math.chain(1).std(2, 3, 4)` but I feel like this should be discouraged to use.\r\nIt make code hard to read and also lead to a weird error message like what I found.\r\n\r\nI also think that it'd have different `MathJsChain` return for value of type `number`, `MathArray`, and `Matrix`.\r\nThis way, it can be easily distinguish which step cause an error along the chain. \r\nThere are many way to achieve this. For example, common base class of chain then specialized class for any concrete type. Another example, using type composition.  But this probably need to have a long discussion which probably out-of-scope for this PR.",
      "Thanks. Given your responses:\r\n\r\n> So my opinion is that I can make a change to accept a use case like `Math.chain(1).std(2, 3, 4)` but I feel like this should be discouraged to use.\r\n> It make code hard to read and also lead to a weird error message like what I found.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n> That's all. So that doesn't really seem like _all_ that much work to me\r\n\r\nI think you are right, this isn't a usage pattern that we would like to support. Let's then go for disabling splitting of rest parameters in both TypeScript definitions and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nLet's address this in two separate PR's:\r\n\r\n1. TypeScript definitions: @NattapongSiri is your PR on par or are there still changes needed to match the desired behavior?\r\n2. We will have to implement some code to restrict this behavior in chained calls, along the lines of the proposal of @gwhitney . I have opened a separate issue to address that: #2485",
      "I think there's no need for me to modify anything more as it's already did just that.",
      "I agree with NattapongSiri, this PR is fine as it stands in light of #2485. So I will update it in preparation for one of us merging it, and make work on #2485 my top priority so it can be slated for v11.\r\n",
      "Oh and @NattapongSiri  if you submit further PRs please could you make them on a branch (rather than on your clone of 'develop') -- it is a bit more cumbersome for us working with a distinct branch with the same name as the main 'develop' branch, thanks.",

Compares stdout and stderr to reference copies.\r\n\r\nAs requested in #2264 (hopefully this can be a first step in clearing that and/or #2279 out of the PR queue).\r\nSome caveats that should be considered in review of this PR:\r\n1) I did not check that the results of all of the examples were sensible; if they ran, I simply took their current output as the reference.\r\n2) Please someone check that I fixed the non-operational `examples/advanced/custom_argument_parsing.js` in the correct way (it's quite unclear to me how one is supposed to create a subscope in user code (as opposed to internally within mathjs, where it is easy to import utils/scope.js).) Do I even need to make a copy of the scope I get in the raw function, as the document says it's already a shallow copy of the ambient scope? (i.e. can I set the specified variable in scope and dispense with the creation of fnScope altogether? I verified that it produced the same values if I did it that way, but I wasn't sure it was truly \"safe\" to the point where it's OK for the example to show doing things that way.)\r\n3) `node examples/advanced/custom_loading.js` didn't actually run at all, since by default `node` doesn't support import. So I renamed this file to `custom_loading.mjs` (as it seems to be a module anyway) and then it's ignored by the test harness I have added. Problem solved ;-) Seriously, if there's a way to add a custom test for this one in examples.test.js, please guide me. Thanks.\r\n4) There is an issue with `examples/import.js`. I assumed that on the automated test machine, numbers and numeric would not be installed. So I used as the reference the output when these are not installed. That's all fine, but it means importing these external packages is not tested. If it should be, what should I do? I didn't think that having a test install a package would be a good idea, as it will then be too easy for these packages to end up checked in as dependencies of mathjs, which they are not. So should I just leave this be or should we try to engineer a specific test for importing external packages into mathjs?\r\n5) I didn't see any convenient way to test `examples/advanced/web_server` but thats a sub-sub-directory and so ignored by my harness. Again problem solved ;-) and again if there is a suggestion on a custom test for this stuff, please let me know.\r\n6) I didn't even try to come up with a way to test the things in `examples/browser`. There are no `.js` files so the harness doesn't care. If there is a reasonable way to test them, let me know and I will add another harness just for them.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, these comprise a really solid putting of mathjs through its paces, so hopefully what's there in this PR will be helpful in the future. (I am thinking also of writing a test in a separate PR which checks the output of every example in every embedded-docs help against a reference copy as well, as that should be pretty complete, too. There's a fair amount of overlap there with the unit tests, but also a fair amount of unique examples, and so it seems like we may as well use them.)",

Two alternate contexts are provided, `simplify.realContext` and `simplify.positiveContext`, which are guaranteed to preserve the values of expressions on all reals and all positive reals, respectively. Or a custom context with specific operator properties can be passed in, and the simplify rules are tagged with the properties they depend on so they will only be applied if appropriate. Multiple tests for the new option are supplied. (However, even with these tests and the best effort to be complete, it is likely that some rules could still use further annotation, which should hopefully be easy to add if/when simplification anomalies come up.)\r\n\r\nResolves #2391.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly a larger-than-usual PR. It is the smallest PR that I could come up with that addressed all of the points in the issue it attempts to resolve. However, given that it is large, I am perfectly willing to break it up and submit as a sequence of two or more PRs. If that is preferred, please just let me know what pieces you recommend I break it into. Thanks.",

      "feat(simplify): Provide context option to control simplifications allowed (#2399)\n\n* feat(simplify): Allow context option\r\n\r\n  If the options argument has a key 'context', it value is interpreted\r\n  as a context specifying various (non-default) properties of operators.\r\n  This context is propagated to all rules and all matching.\r\n\r\n  Adds some initial tests that the context option affects the behavior\r\n  of simplify appropriately. Not all can be activated until in a future\r\n  commit we add the ability for the application of a rule to be contingent\r\n  on aspects of the context.\r\n\r\n  Note that the enhanced rule matching necessary to support rules\r\n  constrained by non-default operator properties led to a couple of\r\n  changes to the output of rationalize() as well. Since the new output\r\n  seemed to better match what a person would typical write for the\r\n  rationalized form, this commit changed the test rather than attempted\r\n  to preserve the exact prior order of terms.\r\n\r\n* feat(simplifyCore): strip all parentheses\r\n\r\n  Prior to this commit, simplifyCore stripped internal parentheses, but\r\n  would leave top-level ones. But top-level parentheses don't carry any\r\n  semantics, and no tests other than the ones that explicitly checked for\r\n  the retention of top-level parentheses were affected by this change.\r\n  Not making a special case for the top level also notably streamlined the\r\n  code in simplifyCore.\r\n\r\n  Adds tests for the new parenthesis-stripping behavior, as well as for\r\n  other node types that were added earlier but which did not yet have\r\n  simplifyCore tests.\r\n\r\n* refactor(simplifyCore): Strip any node marked as trivial in context\r\n\r\n  This replaces special-case tests for unary + and parentheses, and\r\n  paves the way for example for 'abs' being marked trivial in a\r\n  putative positiveContext\r\n\r\n* refactor(simplify): Rename 'context' parameter to rules and document it.\r\n\r\n  The new name is 'imposeContext' -- the motivation for the change is to\r\n  distinguish the parameter for 'assuming', which will be added as a new\r\n  parameter to control rule application based on context.\r\n\r\n* feat(simplify): Allow context-based conditions on rule application.\r\n\r\n  Adds a new property of rules specified as objects: `assuming`. Its\r\n  value should be a context, and every property specified in that context\r\n  must match the incoming context, or else the rule will not be applied.\r\n  Updates the constant floating rules to require their operators be commutative,\r\n  as a test of the feature, and adds a unit test for this.\r\n\r\n* feat(simplify): annotate rules with underlying assumptions\r\n\r\n  Also activates a number of tests of simplifications that should\r\n  or should not occur in various contexts.\r\n\r\n  To get all tests to pass, I could no longer find a rule ordering\r\n  that worked in all cases, without the ability to mark an individual\r\n  rule as applying repeatedly until just that rule stabilized. So this\r\n  commit also adds that ability, and uses it to eliminate the tricky rule\r\n  of expanding n1 + (n2 + n3)*(-1) to n1 + n2*(-1) + n3*(-1) late in the\r\n  rule ordering, in favor of the more intuitive (complete) expansion of\r\n  (n1 + n2)*(-1) to n1*(-1) + n2*(-1) early in the rule ordering, before\r\n  constant folding and gathering of like terms.\r\n\r\n* feat(simplify): Add contexts for specific domains\r\n\r\n  In particular, adds a `simplify.realContext` and a `simplify.positiveContext`\r\n  which (attempt to) guarantee that no simplifications that change the value\r\n  of the expression, on any real number or any positive real number,\r\n  respectively, will occur.\r\n\r\n  Adds multiple tests for these contexts, including verification that the\r\n  simplification in either context does not change some example values of\r\n  any of the expressions in any simplify test.\r\n\r\n  This testing uncovered that it is unaryPlus that must be marked as trivial\r\n  for simplifyCore to work properly, so that marking is added as well.\r\n\r\n* chore: Alter value consistency tests for browsers/older Node\r\n\r\n  The problem was NaN != NaN in some JavaScripts but not others,\r\n  so test for \"both values NaN\" explicitly before using deepEqual.\r\n\r\n* fix: Implement requested changes from review\r\n\r\n  Added documentation about scope and context in top-level algebra functions\r\n  page; made variable name less abbreviated; performed suggested refactoring.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jos de Jong <wjosdejong@gmail.com>"

We do this only when we think the\nadvantage is worth the cost and only when the rule is\n<a href=\"https://standardjs.com/#is-there-an-automatic-formatter\">auto-fixable</a>.</p>\n<p>In these situations, we have a &quot;transition period&quot; where the rule change is only\na &quot;warning&quot;. Warnings don't cause <code>standard</code> to return a non-zero (error)\nexit code. However, a warning message will still print to the console. During\nthe transition period, <code>using standard --fix</code> will update your code so that it's\nready for the next major version.</p>\n<p>The slow and careful approach is what we strive for with <code>standard</code>. We're\ngenerally extremely conservative in enforcing the usage of new language\nfeatures.

      "Word size suffix and BigNumber support for bin oct hex literals (#1996)\n\n* added support for word size suffix in getToken\r\n\r\n* start modifying number(string) to support word size suffix for signed integers\r\n\r\n* word size suffixes for Number\r\n\r\n* initial support for BigNumber\r\n\r\n* fix linter issues\r\n\r\n* remove unused variable\r\n\r\n* start extending bitwise operators for Number for values greater than 32 bits\r\n\r\n* Revert \"start extending bitwise operators for Number for values greater than 32 bits\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 6fac1a7b10665a221ab5de521c08fa9fcf959eb1.\r\n\r\n* add a test for 53 bit literal\r\n\r\n* added an optional second argument to bin, oct, and hex to allow formatting signed numbers with custom word size\r\n\r\n* removed size checks\r\n\r\n* Attempted to extend bin, oct, hex format functions to work with BigNumber, but not working fully.\r\n\r\nApparently Decimal.js toString method doesn't take a base parameter like js number does. I guess I have to do the formatting myself.\r\n\r\n* Added n2base function to do formatting for BigNumber.\r\n\r\n* Added check for zero in n2base.\r\n\r\n* Removed old failing tests.\r\n\r\n* Added some tests (failing).\r\n\r\n* Extended 'format' function with 'base' and 'wordSize' options and changed 'bin', 'oct', and 'hex' to use 'format' function.\r\n\r\n* Fixed lint issues.\r\n\r\n* Fixed issues related to the merge.\r\n\r\n* Corrected a test.\r\n\r\n* Fixed bignumber formatter.\r\n\r\n* Added tests for math.format with 'base' and 'wordSize' options.\r\n\r\n* Fixed lint issue.\r\n\r\n* Changed 'base' option to 'bin', 'oct', and 'hex' values for 'notation' option of 'format' function.\r\n\r\n* Added word size suffix to the output of format, bin, oct, and hex.\r\n\r\n* Updated documentation."

    "body": "### What it changes\r\n\r\nThere are three main parts of this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Add `.js` extension to all the `import` statements in the `src` directory.\r\n    This makes it ES module compliant, as file extensions are [required for ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_mandatory_file_extensions), and work for CommonJS as well.\r\n    When scripts are compiled to CommonJS or ESM it retains the file extension in the `import` / `require` statements.\r\n    _I did try to get Gulp to be able to change the extension to `.mjs` for ESM and `.cjs` for CommonJS, but couldn't find a way of doing it._\r\n    _Instead, I had to settle with adding a `package.json` file in the compiled ESM directory to specify the `type: module`, the inverse of the example here: https://2ality.com/2019/10/hybrid-npm-packages.html#variant%3A-avoiding-.mjs It can't be a bad idea if he's suggesting it_ :wink:\r\n2. Adds [conditional `exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_conditional_exports) property to the `packages.json` file, which tells node 12+ which files to use, depending on whether you're using `import` or `require`.\r\n  _On node < 12, it will fallback to the `main` property of the `package.json` as it currently does, so there should be no difference there._\r\n3. Changes the Gruntfile so that all compiled scripts are now under a single root directory, `lib`, rather than several different ones.\r\n    We now have:\r\n    - `/dist` -> `/lib/browser/`: The scripts suitable for browser use\r\n    - `/lib` -> `lib/umd/`: The CommonJS / UMD scripts\r\n    - `/esm` -> `/lib/esm`: The ES module scripts\r\n\r\nIt also removes the root `/number.js` file, as the `exports` points directly to the compiled ones.\r\n\r\n### What it fixes\r\n\r\nThis aims to fix https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/1928 when trying to use mathjs ESM directly in node, without a package bundler.\r\nCurrently, node either tries to load the CommonJS versions and doesn't like it or, if you specify an ESM script it complains about the lack of file extension.\r\n\r\nIt also attempts to fix the issue https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/issues/1766 although there's currently an [outstanding issue with Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/9771), where it doesn't understand the `exports` property.\r\nHowever, once Jest _does_ support `exports`, these changes should work for Jest as well, fixing that issue.\r\nIn the meantime, you should be able to work around it by being specific with the `import` path:\r\n\r\n- `import mathjs/lib/esm/number.js` should work as the `package.json` tells us it's an ESM file.\r\n- `import mathjs/lib/umd/number.js` should also work as it uses CommonJS `require` anyway.\r\n\r\n### How it's tested\r\n\r\n- I have made sure that `npm run build` still completes successfully, and that the tests all still run and pass (locally, and they also pass in Travis).\r\n- I've tested the changes manually in a separate project, by creating both an `.mjs` and `.cjs` file, importing mathjs and running scripts.\r\n- I've also run it through a bundler (Rollup) and it all still works.\r\n- The automated Travic tests seem to assert that Webpack handles things correctly.\r\n\r\n**These changes are very much breaking changes.**\r\n\r\n_I'm more than happy to discuss this PR, and happy to make any changes._",

Similar to [`usolve`](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions/usolve.html) and [`lsolve`](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions/lsolve.html), `usolveAll`  and `lsolveAll` return **an array** containing the vectors that make up an [affine basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)#Geometry) of the solution space. This means that all valid solutions can be expressed as an [affine combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_combination) of these vectors.\r\n\r\n**Example usage:**\r\n```typescript\r\nconst M = [[0,1,2],[0,1,1],[0,0,0]]\r\nconst b = [2,2,0]\r\nmath.usolveAll(M, b)\r\n// [ [[0], [2], [0]], [[1], [2], [0]] ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously, `u`-, `l`- and `lusolve` thrown an error when no solution existed. I kept it this way for now, but I'm tempted to return an empty array instead, as there is nothing *bad* or *wrong* about the case when a system doesn't have a solution, and throwing an unnecessary error might force users to write a lot of surplus try-catch blocks.

    "body": "\nLet’s get started with automated dependency management for mathjs :muscle:\n\n🔒 Greenkeeper has found a `package-lock.json` file in this repository. Greenkeeper supports lockfile updates for public packages. If you use private packages in your repository, please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure these can get updated as well.\n\nThis pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.\n\n**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository’s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n<details>\n<summary>🏗 How to configure Travis CI</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper has added a rule to your `.travis.yml` that whitelists Greenkeeper branches, which are created when your dependencies are updated. Travis CI will run your tests on these branches automatically to see if they still pass.\n\nNo additional setup is required 😊\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>\n\nYou may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency’s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).\n\nTo make sure Greenkeeper doesn’t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update.\n\n```js\n// package.json\n{\n  …\n  \"greenkeeper\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\n      \"package-names\",\n      \"you-want-me-to-ignore\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>\n\n```bash\n  # Change into your repository’s directory\n  git fetch --all\n  git checkout greenkeeper/initial\n  npm install-test\n  # Adapt your code until everything works again\n  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'\n  git push https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs.git greenkeeper/initial\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>✨ How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>\n\nAfter you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.\n\n```diff\n-  \"underscore\": \"^1.6.0\"\n+  \"underscore\": \"^1.7.0\"\n```\n\nThe above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).\nWhen the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.\n\nHowever, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.\n\nThis way, you’ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you’ll be the first to know.\n\n```diff\n-  \"lodash\": \"^3.0.0\"\n+  \"lodash\": \"^4.0.0\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.\nFor version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.\n\nThis means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** – Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.\n\nThese pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:\n\nTo get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html).

      "Update standard to the latest version 🚀 (#1226)\n\n* chore(package): update standard to version 12.0.0\r\n\r\n* update to new lint version with --fix\r\n\r\nI believe this mainly adds whitespace to `{}`'s.\r\n\r\n* Replace assert.equal with assert.strictEqual\r\n\r\nThis breaks a lot of tests which I will endevour to fix in the next\r\ncommits.\r\n\r\n* Fix most errors due to assert.strictEquals\r\n\r\nSome instances of `strictEquals` are replaced by `deepEquals`.\r\n`toString` has been used to make some string comparisions explicit.\r\nTests will still fail untill #1236 and #1237 are fixed.\r\n\r\n* Fix assertion erros due to -0\r\n\r\nWith node 10, assert.strictEqual no longer considers `0 === -0`.\r\nI missed these first time round as I was using node 8.\r\n\r\n* Put toString correct side of bracket\r\n\r\nI was converting the constructor to a string rather\r\nthan the result of the computation. Oops.\r\n\r\n* Fixed #1236: quantileSeq has inconsistant return\r\n\r\n* Update package-lock\r\n\r\n* Fixed #1237: norm sometimes returning a complex number instead of number\r\n\r\n* Fix cli tests\r\n\r\n* More changes for standardjs, and fixes in unit tests"

Had to workout a bit how everything worked with GIT and how everything was programmed. \r\n\r\n`linspace` is closely related to the `range` function. But instead of setting a step you set the number of points you want. Actually wanted to use `range` to implement `linspace`. Because `linspace` 'should' be equivalent to `range` since the step is equal to `(end - start)/(n - 1)`. However `range` seems numerically less accurate since `math.range(1,5,(5-1)/(4-1),true)` gives `[ 1, 2.333333333333333, 3.666666666666666, 4.999999999999999 ]` while `math.linspace(1,5,4)` would give `[ 1, 2.3333333333333335, 3.6666666666666665, 5 ]`.\r\n\r\nWhen building with `npm run build`, it told me that `linspace` and `logspace` didn't had any documentation. Where should I add that for the build to not give a warning? Because I documented the code? ",

The function takes any object as an input and finds out the input's Matrix datatype. In short, if you give `[[1,2,3], [4,5,6]` it returns `number` and `[[1,2,true],[1,false,3]]` returns `mixed`. \r\n\r\n**Completed Tasks:**\r\n1. create a low level `Array` implementation of getMatrixDataType\r\n2. create a method getDataType on `DenseMatrix` which internally calls the getMatrixDataType Array function on the _data property (a one liner)\r\n3. create a method getDataType on `SparseMatrix` which internally calls the getMatrixDataType Array function on the _values property (a one liner)\r\n4. create a high level typed-function `getMatrixDataType` in src/function/matrix which is exposed on math, supporting all three different matrix types\r\n5.

Please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure this gets updated as well.\n\nThis pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.\n\n**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository’s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n<details>\n<summary>💥 Tests on this branch are failing. Here’s how to proceed.</summary>\n\nTo solve the issue, first find out which of the dependency’s updates is causing the problem. Then fix your code to accomodate the changes in the updated dependency. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.\n\nThen push your changes to this branch and merge it.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🏷 How to check the status of this repository</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper adds a badge to your README which indicates the status of this repository.\n\nThis is what your badge looks like right now :point_right:  ![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/josdejong/mathjs.svg)\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>\n\nYou may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency’s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).\n\nTo make sure Greenkeeper doesn’t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update.\n\n```js\n// package.json\n{\n  …\n  \"greenkeeper\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\n      \"package-names\",\n      \"you-want-me-to-ignore\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>\n\n```bash\n  # Change into your repository’s directory\n  git fetch\n  git checkout greenkeeper/initial\n  npm install-test\n  # Adapt your code until everything works again\n  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'\n  git push origin greenkeeper/initial\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>✨ How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>\n\nAfter you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.\n\n```diff\n-  \"underscore\": \"^1.6.0\"\n+  \"underscore\": \"^1.7.0\"\n```\n\nThe above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).\nWhen the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.\n\nHowever, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.\n\nThis way, you’ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you’ll be the first to know.\n\n```diff\n-  \"lodash\": \"^3.0.0\"\n+  \"lodash\": \"^4.0.0\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.\nFor version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.\n\nThis means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** – Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.\n\nThese pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:\n\nTo get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html). If those don’t help, you can always [ask the humans behind Greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\nGood luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:\n\nYour [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) bot :palm_tree:\n",

That's why I want to propose the [BRIIM](https://bri.im/) community as [Slack Community](https://slack.bri.im/) for your library. I believe it would help people tons to discuss and learn from each other in an interactive chat.\r\n\r\nBRIIM, the Machine Learning in JS movement, tries to gather all developers using ML and ML related libraries in JS in one community. I believe it is great to learn from each other when using one library, but also to explore other libraries in the ML in JS ecosystem. So far, every library is its own little community. However, in order to make ML in JS a larger topic this year, I try to bring together all developers/communities with this movement. \r\n\r\nEven though mathjs is only partially related to ML, it can be used to a great extend when just starting out with Machine Learning. [Personally, I did it this way](https://www.robinwieruch.de/linear-algebra-matrix-javascript/). That's why I hope you would consider to join the Slack Group, but also because it would be beneficial for the user of mathjs.\r\n\r\nIn the next days, I want to propose the community [to other ML and ML related libraries](https://bri.im/libraries) too. It would be great to have you with us in order to strengthen the ML in JS movement in 2018 :) If you are more interested in my doings, please checkout [this blog post](https://www.robinwieruch.de/machine-learning-javascript-web-developers/). I hope the article shows that I mean it serious with BRIIM :) Thanks for considering to participate! If it doesn't work out, you can always leave the Slack Community. **But I hope to bootstrap this community to make ML in JS happen in 2018.** 🚀 ",

The reason why is the outer negation turns into a multiply by `-1`, but this blocks the flattening of the entire expression, so the outer and inner like terms never get a chance to combine.\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds an additional rule to `simplify` that allows for this flattening to take place by distributing the `-1` factor over the inner terms. While this does fix the cases above (simplifying them to `12 - x` and `-y`, respectively) and related expressions, it does not help with expressions such as `10 - 5 * (x - 2)`. However, the more general cases (such as this one) are more difficult, since we cannot guarantee that these transformations will be useful (consider `10 + (y + 2) * (y - 2)`, should this be multiplied out or not?). As such, for now I think the rule specifically for negatives added in this pull request is a good improvement for now, and at some later point in time we can have a discussion about what behavior we want for `simplify` in such cases.\r\n\r\nAlso, sorry for all the whitespace changes!

They are documented in `read.md`. The code is in `poly.js`, the batch of tests is in `testPoly.js`, additional remarks in `test.md`\r\n\r\n`isPolynomial` checks whether a polynomial is rationalizable, `rationalize` rationalizes a rationalizable polynomial. `numerator` and `denominator` gets the two parts of a fraction of polynomials using the `rationalize` function. `polyToCanonical` converts a near canonical polynomial to a canonical polynomial with decreasing exponent. \r\n\r\nFinally, for the purpose of testing, I used the `solveEq` function to solve various equations and checking the roots with the original polynomial using the [`poly_roots`](https://github.com/scijs/poly-roots)  (project in _GitHub_ that implements solving polynomials equations with _Jenkins Traub_ method  [(*1)](#obs1).  It's an easy way to testing the simplification accuracy. \r\n\r\nMost of these solving packages require the polynomial coefficients as a vector in ascending or descending order.  `PolyToCanonical` does it, generating also an array of coefficients.\r\n\r\nObviously I do not know the  **`Mathjs`** from inside. So I don't know,  if it's the case, which is the technique to incorporate the functions in the interface factory  It seemed to me that **`Mathjs`** uses a  sophisticated scheme.  \r\n\r\nI imagine, if you like this proposal, that this merge is easy to accomplish, for those who know it.\r\n\r\n_<a name=\"obs1\"></a>(*1) [rreusser](https://github.com/rreusser) tells that **Durand-Kerner's** method is best. In fact, it's faster and simpler. However the **Jenkins-Traub** method is more stable and converges where the other methods stuck, especially in equations with multiple roots, like `(x-1)^6 = 0` that has 6 real roots equal to 1_ \r\n\r\n",

I also merged with v3.6.\r\n\r\nThere were a few issues that came up:\r\n\r\n1. I felt that `math.eval` should always return a number rather than having a special case for the `simplify` and `derivative` functions, so I changed the way are used to this (curly braces are expression trees here):\r\n\r\n`math.simplify('x+x')`                                       ->  {2*x}\r\n`math.simplify('derivative(x^2+x, x)')`             ->  {2*x+1}\r\n`math.parse('derivative(x^2+x, x)').eval({x:1})` ->  3\r\n`math.parse('derivative(x^2+x, x)').simplify()` ->  {2*x+1}\r\n\r\n2. You can also customize `simplify` by passing in your own set of rules:\r\n\r\n`expr = math.parse('x+1+x')`\r\n`expr.simplify(['c+v -> v+c'])`    ->  {x+x+1}\r\n`expr.simplify(['n+n -> 2*n'])`   ->  {1+2*x}\r\n\r\nThe rules can also be functions. The constant folding function can be accessed from `math.algebra.simplify.simplifyConstant`.\r\n\r\n3. I didn't think of a good way to decide whether or not operators are commutative and associative. For now, `multiply` and `add` operators are both hard coded as being commutative and associative, but that may not be true depending on the context.\r\n\r\n4. The algorithm doesn't simplify across inverse operators. For instance, {x-1+x} will not simplify further.\r\n\r\n5. I didn't try to deal with matrices and other things possible in mathjs, partly because of issue 3.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement could be to classify subtrees as rational functions and make use of something like [polynomial.js](https://github.com/infusion/Polynomial.js/) to simplify them.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to clean some things up later but what do you think of these changes?",

For matrices this made sense as you want to see the whole updated matrix as output in a maths application.

With the newest version of fraction.js, the whole part exclusion is optional.\n\nSo if you update fraction.js, you can make  use of toFraction(). The same is true for toLatex().\n\nUpdating fraction.js in general makes sense at the moment, as I implemented some more performance improvements, which can speed up things for some use cases.\n\nRobert\n",

The lhs of each rule is matched recursively to subtrees within the expression to be simplified, then the subtree is replaced with the rhs of the rule with the various parts of the original tree substituted in. I've added a few basic rules which I hand-tailored to simplify things like `math.eval(derivative(x*x*x*x))` and so forth. The real strength of the `simplify` function will come from crafting the right rules.\n\nI've left some debug `console.log` statements in so you can see what's happening better.

The precedence of implicit multiplications is ambiguous in mathematics (does `1/2x` mean half x or a half divided by x?). With math.js we choose to handle implicit multiplication with the same precedence as divisions ([see docs](http://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html#precedence)), so `1 m / kg s` would be parsed as `((1 * m) / kg) * s`. Both parsers should work consistent. Would it be ok with you if we change `Unit.parse` such that it handles implicit multiplication with the same precedence as division, see this PR?\n- `Unit.parse` previously returned `null` when it couldn't parse a string (`Complex.parse` does the same). You changed this to throwing an error and added some comments in the unit tests. There are arguments for both, but I agree it would be safer to throw exceptions by default. If we do that, we should correct the code comments accordingly, change the behavior of `Complex.parse`, and cleanup the unit tests. \n  \n  I _think_ we can safely change this without releasing this as a breaking v3, as these parse functions are not part of the public, documented API and only used internally.\n\nIn this PR I also added support for explicit multiplication like `5 J*s`.\n",

The algorithms are a port from [SuiteSparse library](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/publications.html)(C language) to JavaScript.

The [SuiteSparse library](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/publications.html) port is kept private to mathjs.\n",

    "body": "It's finally ready, including an update of the pretty printing example page and an update of the documentation.\n\nThis introduces a new `ParenthesisNode` that will always get parsed into the node tree. The `toString` and `toTex` functions then use or ignore those `ParenthesisNodes` based on the parenthesis configuration.\n\nThe new parenthesis configuration option has the following three options:\n- `keep`: Print parentheses in the same way as they were in the input (default)\n- `auto`: Sanitize parentheses. This is the way it has been in v1.\n- `all`: Print all parentheses to make the structure of the node tree explicit (this also ignores `ParenthesisNodes`).\n\nWhat's still missing is a way to pass the configuration to `toTex` and `toString` directly, but I want to have this code reviewed first before implementing that.\n\nHow I want to implement the missing part:\n- Every function can have a `.toString` or `.toTex` property that is either a callback function or a template string.\n- Both `toTex` and `toString` can have two parameters\n  - `config`: A config object that locally overrides the global parenthesis option\n  - `callback`: The same callback as right now. (this is still necessary because the `.toString` and `.toTex` properties aren't powerful enough to handle all the cases that those callbacks can [like overwriting `toTex` and `toString` of the nodes for example] and it allows changing the behaviour for a single function call). This callback will override the `.toString` and `.toTex` properties.\n\nI'm asking everyone to play around with the LaTeX output and the different parenthesis options (via `examples/browser/pretty_printing_with_mathjax.html`) because this topic is quite complex and there can very well be bugs that slipped through ( even ones that are still present in v1). But if you do so, don't forget to run `npm run build` beforehand. One thing to notice though: The LaTeX output for `FunctionNode`s is still pretty ugly because it isn't able to sanitize parentheses, so there are too many of them in most cases. I haven't tackled this problem so far.\n",

It allows having multiple maps and merging them together ( you can easily combine callbacks from several sources ).\n2. It's a more intuitive UI in my opinion.\n3. It's still possible to just pass a single callback if you want to.\n4. It's only 9 lines of code and it can be easily replaced by a better solution in v2.\n\n**Update:** I fixed my fix ( see commit message ).

There are two definitions of standard deviation (population and sample), in my case I used what I think is the most common.\n\nI've also created a function to help me called: deepApply. This function takes a matrix, a dimension and a function that works with an array as input and that should return a single number, and returns a new matrix, with a less dimension after having applied the given function to the desired dimension. If the callback function provided doesnt return a scalar, but another multidimensional vector, the function should work right, returning a matrix with more dimensions. This is used to calculate the standard deviation of a matrix. If you use the previous reduce function, you will be using a lot more memory because I think you have to make a full copy of the matrix.\n\nWell, that's it. Review the code and tell me if you don't like something. I'm not able to create test cases with bignumber :( sorry.\n",

The function has been tested with the 'max' procedure, look in the code to see how easy is now to apply the 'max' function to a matrix.\n\nIn theory, every \"reducing\" function (statistical functions, mostly) can be implemented using this \"reduce\" function, as it's commonly done in Scheme/Haskell/Python/Hadoop and some other functional-related programming languages.\n\nAlso, more testing in the reduce function are needed, specially empty cases and things like that, I know they are not implemented yet, but this is a proof of concept.\n",

Each stage of Gaussian elimination changes the determinant in one of the following ways:\n- Swapping two rows negates the determinant\n- Scaling a row by a factor c also multiplies the determinant by c\n- Adding a multiple of one row to another has no effect\n\nIn a finite sequence of these operations, you end up with a \"row-reduced\" matrix, which is either the identity matrix or a matrix that is almost the identity matrix except for some number of zero rows. In the former case, the determinant is the cumulative number we've calculated. In the latter case, the matrix is singular so we just return 0.\n\nAn alternate way of thinking about this is Gaussian elimination factors your matrix into a product M = E_1 E_2 ... E_n I, where each E_i is an \"elementary matrix\" corresponding to one of the above 3 operations - swapping two rows, scaling a row by c, or adding a multiple of one row to another - and having determinant -1, c, or 1, respectively. The matrix I is either the identity or the identity missing some rows as described above, so that det(I) is either 1 or 0. Because det is a homomorphism (i.e. det(AB)=det(A)det(B)) this factorization gives an easy way of computing det(M) as the product det(E_1)...det(E_n)det(I).\n\nThe advantage of this method is twofold. The algorithm runs in O(n^3), as opposed to calculation by minors which scales as O(n!). It also doesn't use recursion, which might cause a stack overflow for matrices bigger than maybe 5x5.\n",

    "body": "Hi Jos, as usual with your work: great stuff! I did find a little bug though: your parser handles the power operator like any other binary operator (left associative), while the power operator is (in most cases) right associative. I.e., the expression `a^b^c` is now being parsed as:\n\n```\n    ^\n   / \\\n  ^   c\n / \\\na   b\n```\n\nwhile it should be parsed as:\n\n```\n  ^ \n / \\\na   ^\n   / \\\n  b   c\n```\n\nSince the parser is a LL (top-down) parser, this desired structure is a bit tricky to get. A possible solution: \n\nFor the input `\"a^b^c\"` the parser would first create `(^ a b)` and would then encounter `\"^c\"`. Now instead of creating the AST `(^ (^ a b) c)`, you do the following inside `Parser.prototype.parse_pow`:\n- make the 'old' left child of `(^ a b)` (node `a`) the left child of the new node: `(^ a (^ . b))`\n- move the old right child, node `b`, to the left: `(^ a (^ b . ))`\n- put the new node, `c`, to the right of `b`: `(^ a (^ b c))`\n\nMy pull request has the scheme above implemented, including some unit tests.\n\nCheers,\n\nBart.\n",
