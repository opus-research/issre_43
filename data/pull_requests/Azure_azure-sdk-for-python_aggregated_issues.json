Since this is the first addition of crc64, it also adds functions to facilitate handing the `validate_content` user input option and calculating a CRC64 over arbitrary data.\r\n\r\nSome things to note:\r\n- If `validate_content=True` I've tried to leave that code path unchanged and therefore it will use a pipeline policy for MD5 header calculation as it did before. The pipeline policy was modified slightly to only work on a `True` value and for the most part, we now only include the `validate_content` param in the request context if it is `True`.\r\n- This is not using Structured Message at all yet. Since this path of upload_blob is buffered, it uses the traditional header approach. Right now, this means it is forced into the buffering path but there is future work to add support to the streaming path.\r\n- The new `md5` option actually does not use the pipeline policy and instead follows a similar approach to `crc64`. This will not always be the case but for buffered `upload_blob`, it is.\r\n- There is a future work item to calculate an overall CRC when reading from the input stream and compose each chunks' CRC to be compared at the end before committing.",

That is due to the _check_forbidden_response call which can't handle HTML. If the call to the Imds server is made behind a corporate proxy (other another API gateway), the request times out with a 504 and the gateway returns an HTML response. At this point, the Imds -> ManagedIdentityCredential should fail and move on to the next auth mechanism, but instead it fails.

      "Merge pr 35022 into pr34694 - Add Start Time To CF, Fix Retryable Exception in First Page Bug, and Fix Case Sensitive Headers Bug (#35090)\n\n* Add start time to change feed query\r\n\r\nAdds start time, at the moment has a work around for getting all the documents.\r\n\r\n* Added condition to make change feed work with start time\r\n\r\nStart time change feed queries always result in the initial fetch results being empty, which is a deviation in behaviour from other change feed options. To accommodate that we check if we have the start time change feed option and check if it is the first fetch request in order to grab the continuation value from etag to get the rest of the results.\r\n\r\n* Add new HTTP Header for Async Etag\r\n\r\nAdded a new header to remove ambuiguity between 'etag' meant for sync clients and 'Etag' meant for async clients in our code for header strings.\r\n\r\n* Update start time tests\r\n\r\nadded negative test for start time option of change feed.\r\n\r\n* comment fix\r\n\r\n* Readme and changelog updates\r\n\r\n* Fix bug with retryable exception in first page\r\n\r\n* Adds fix to response header type and other needed changes for the merged prs\r\n\r\nResponse headers are now CIMultDict type (Case insensitive Multi Dictionaries) which fixes any issues regarding casing of header strings. This also has changes to merge changes from PR 35022 without issues.\r\n\r\n* Testing retry on execution context bug\r\n\r\nThis code checks if a 429 error has occured in which case we reset has started and try getting the fetch items again\r\n\r\n* Debugging additions\r\n\r\nAdded code to help debug. This will catch 429 exception when it occurs on first page of query so we can see whats going on.\r\n\r\n* Moved has_Started flag to after fetch function\r\n\r\nMoving the has_Started flag to after the fetch function seems to make the behaviour better align with what is expected. Retries are properly done for queries that got 429 in the first page of their query, and 429s are also being properly surfaced when retries runout.\r\n\r\n* update _base.py\r\n\r\n* Pylint fixes\r\n\r\nRemove trailing spaces, bad indentation, and unused imports\r\n\r\n* update start time tests\r\n\r\n* Removed testing artifacts updated Changelog\r\n\r\n* Added Test Coverage for retryable exception bug\r\n\r\nThis push adds test coverage for the retryable exception bug that this PR fixes. It recreates the scenario of the original bug and verifies that the fix is working. This also changes the start time datetime to always be converted to UTC regardless of timezone or if it is a naive datetime.\r\n\r\n* Fixed Comments\r\n\r\nFixed outdated comments to better match new code.\r\n\r\n* Update sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Kushagra Thapar <kushuthapar@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* Update sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Kushagra Thapar <kushuthapar@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* Update sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Kushagra Thapar <kushuthapar@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* optimization changes\r\n\r\nAdded further optimizations.\r\n\r\n* update _base.py\r\n\r\npylint fixes\r\n\r\n* Add samples for start time change feed\r\n\r\nAdd samples for start time change feed\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Nick Cooper <nick@not.fun>\r\nCo-authored-by: Kushagra Thapar <kushuthapar@gmail.com>"

      "To make sure we are on same page, if any of these env vars are missing, e.g. client_id is not set, identity library does not attempt to use ClientSecretCredential.\r\n\r\nBecause the env var is not set automatically, the case is you explicitly set client_id, but the value is empty string. (it is different from client_id is not set).\r\n\r\nIn this case, our recommendation is double check the value of the env var you set or remove the empty client_id env var.",
      "I agree with your that empty value can be considered as error.\r\nWhether to accept empty value is just a design choice, but that's not my point.\r\nThe problem here is it raises ValueError while doc only mentions CredentialUnavailableError, so either a bug in code or doc.\r\n\r\n> Exceptions\r\n[CredentialUnavailableError](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.credentialunavailableerror?view=azure-python)\r\nenvironment variable configuration is incomplete\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.environmentcredential?view=azure-python",

This is the [workitem](https://dev.azure.com/ceapex/Engineering/_workitems/edit/950573?src=WorkItemMention&src-action=artifact_link) that's driving this work.\r\n\r\n**Language-Settings.ps1** - Implemented the function pointer, GetDocsMsDevLanguageSpecificPackageInfoFn, for Python which is called by [Update-DocsMsMetadata.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/eng/common/scripts/Update-DocsMsMetadata.ps1#L114) when generating/updating the metadata json files in the docs repositories. This function is called after package publish (either official or nightly) and will add the top-level namespace to the json file if it doesn't already exist.\r\n\r\n**Docs-ToC.ps1** - Previously this was using the package name in the children entry of the ToC which was wildly incorrect. With these changes it'll use the top-level namespace as the child entry. The functions added and changes are all in support of this.\r\n\r\nThe [release of azure-template](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3644579&view=logs&j=19b87903-f8bc-5cbb-22d9-4f6eb3469d8e&t=01c0d070-1636-5aed-84c3-1f03a1861eaf&l=19) was done to test the Language-Settings.ps1 changes which will add the namespace to the json file when it first creates it. This is the ⁠[azure-template.json](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-python/blob/main/metadata/preview/azure-template.json#L15) that's now in the docs repo from that release. Notice that it correctly has its namespace in it.\r\n\r\nFixes #34557 \r\nFixes azure/azure-sdk-tools#7906",

      "@kristapratico If there are errors in _generated folder, is it ok to just fix those changes in this repo, or do we have to modify autorest part to make sure our changes will not be overwritten?",
      "@Lakicar95 the autorest error is describing a problem with the spec the code is being generated from. The maps service team will need to make adjustments to correct it before the next time they need to regenerate (including some of the docs changes you're making here). I don't think we should block on this PR because it's important that we enable strict_sphinx so any future changes will comply. I'm going to go ahead and approve / merge this PR. Thanks for all your contributions!",

      "@kristapratico Thanks, so just one question, we can and should make changes to files within _generated directory (even though those changes might be overridden in the future by the autorest tool)? ",
      "@Lakicar95 no, I would not say this is a common case. We really shouldn't make any changes to generated files because they will be overridden upon the next generation. Instead we should make a change to the API spec so the correct code is generated, or, if the bug arises from autorest itself, fix it there. In this case, I'm not certain what the correct fix to the API spec is without input from the maps service team. Upon their next generation they will need to fix both the autorest error and the way they were specifying links. By merging this PR and enabling strict_sphinx, we will at least block on any future PRs until these are fixed. Since this library hasn't seen a new release in awhile, nor did your PR touch any actual code, I favored leniency in merging the change. Hope that helps!"

      "Hi @psalaberria002 \r\n- Python Mgmt SDK depends on azure-mgmt-core instead of azure-core directly\r\n- Python Mgmt SDK is auto generated and [it doesn't use `azure.core.pipeline.policies.SensitiveHeaderCleanupPolicy` by default](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/4b0a56d09f91abab0c9837aad66c5db77aab1190/sdk/compute/azure-mgmt-compute/azure/mgmt/compute/_configuration.py#L56-L66)\r\n\r\nAbove all, if your application want to use `SensitiveHeaderCleanupPolicy`, it is better to upgrade dependency by yourself instead of changing SDK dependency. After all, not all SDK users need `SensitiveHeaderCleanupPolicy`",
      "actually, i don't want to use SensitiveHeaderCleanupPolicy, but if you write the following code:\r\n        self.credential = DefaultAzureCredential()\r\n        self.resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(self.credential, self.subscription_id)\r\n        self.compute_management_client = ComputeManagementClient(self.credential, self.subscription_id)\r\n\r\n It will fail with \"azure.core.pipeline.policies\" does not have property 'SensitiveHeaderCleanupPolicy'.  that is when using the latest mgmt-compute with an azure-core prior to 1.28.1.  perhaps the reference is indirect via azure-mgmt-core, however the SDK itself uses this property so this fails at runtime.\r\n \r\nI believe the error is here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/a9b8513bb26ce0e9dc4eac15dcf897127bd2e954/sdk/compute/azure-mgmt-compute/azure/mgmt/compute/v2017_09_01/_compute_management_client.py#L69 and not in the default policies you referred to.  If there exists a redirect_policy, then it will attempt the SensitiveHeaderCleanupPolicy -- whether or not that is the redirect policy.  But i will need to regenerate the error to give you a proper stack trace -- and if you reopen this issue I will do that for you -- it was indeed in the client or azure-core and related to an 'if self._config.redirect_policy else None' clause.  here is the other location that springs up: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/a9b8513bb26ce0e9dc4eac15dcf897127bd2e954/sdk/core/azure-core/azure/core/_pipeline_client.py#L143",

      "I'm having totally the same issue as it is described by @jim-cooley. \r\nI'll try to simply access synapse notebook contents by using azure-synapse-artifacts.\r\nUsing the recommended ArtifactsClient by simply adding credentials and the endpoint I get the same error.

      "hi @hussein-awala - I'm not entirely positive on the mypy issue that is present for you folks at apache airflow, but these are not changes that we can do on our end. We have not allowed for the creation of non-partitioned containers for years now, and the current improvements we have made to our typing within the Cosmos SDK are relevant and up to date with the behavior we have for the client and for the underlying service. Since the beginning of the async client, this has been marked as a non-optional field for the relevant methods:\r\n![image](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/assets/30335873/7fced6d7-e952-4cd4-bd77-e2d9f219e9c8)\r\nPR in case you're curious: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/21404/files#diff-a274a8107879de7dace0a296bd1f57274e12e22a764ed77c0c0579c275980e1c\r\n\r\nAnd that is for good reason - like I mentioned, this is not behavior we have allowed for several years now and users should be seeing an error when attempting to use None for a partition key definition:\r\n<img width=\"562\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/assets/30335873/e1458d66-e2cb-4656-bd36-f1fade88ffdc\">\r\n\r\nAs such, I'll be closing this PR.",
      "> We have not allowed for the creation of non-partitioned containers for years now\r\n\r\nThis seems incorrect, the method still accepts `None` which is handled by the method without raising an exception:\r\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/a7b794df2bfde674ddc51b0f2f78fa22f2041c56/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos/azure/cosmos/database.py#L224-L225\r\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/a7b794df2bfde674ddc51b0f2f78fa22f2041c56/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos/azure/cosmos/aio/_database.py#L228-L229\r\n\r\nAnd from Cosmos documentation:\r\n> Azure Cosmos DB supports creating containers without a partition key. Currently you can create nonpartitioned containers by using Azure CLI and Azure Cosmos DB SDKs (.NET, Java, NodeJs) that have a version less than or equal to 2.x. You can't create nonpartitioned containers using the Azure portal. However, such nonpartitioned containers aren’t elastic and have fixed storage capacity of 20 GB and throughput limit of 10K RU/s.\r\n",
      "@hussein-awala I see what you mean - while that may look like redundant code, we actually have it there on purpose to ensure we don't fill out the container definition with a None partition key. Reason for that being that the error message returned by the service is a lot more informative that way. Compare the one I sent before vs. this one:\r\n<img width=\"758\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/assets/30335873/e635b5db-720a-4bcf-b133-80eb509c4c32\">\r\n\r\nYou also only included part of that page on documentation for migrating from non-partitioned collections (which are even marked as legacy in that same document) to newer partitioned ones. It is also mentioned there that the behavior is only available for versions <= 2.x.\r\n<img width=\"530\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/assets/30335873/f0c4a236-0045-44f8-99bf-de0c4b72b59e\">\r\n"

    "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a fix to the race condition described in #34711.\r\n\r\nThe approach here is twofold:\r\n1. Require the `lock` while trying to add new events to internal EventBatch buffer\r\n2. Remove unnecessary clean up code\r\n\r\nImplementing either of these would be enough to fix the related issue, but I would argue that both are necessary to make thinks consistent:\r\n\r\n- Change 1. helps preventing future race condition issues, since it properly protects the shared resource `self._cur_batch`. It is especially important to synchronous `BufferedProducer`, since it relies on multi-threading, which can be even more unpredictable than an event loop.\r\n- Change 2. improves the consistency of `self._cur_batch` and `self._cur_buffered_len`:\r\n    - `_cur_batch` is \"reset\" (i.e., assigned to a new `EventBatch` object) when and only when it gets enqueued to `self._buffered_queue`\r\n    - `_cur_buffered_len` is decreased solely as a consequence of a `self._producer.send`. PR #25406 previously introduced a manual reset to this number, but it did not consider the timeout-based exit condition:\r\n        https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/23121a583108b6a09f2d45e3c7d1e99e70c365da/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub/azure/eventhub/aio/_buffered_producer/_buffered_producer_async.py#L190-L200\r\n\r\nA last note regarding Change 1.:\r\n- it seems that the `azure-sdk-for-net` also updates the `self._cur_batch` with a synchronization tool, see [`RunPublishingAsync`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/769f04a20fa288fbb58cc516ff7eeb0d6b048347/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/src/Producer/EventHubBufferedProducerClient.cs#L2262-L2273)\r\n\r\nI also have another small set of changes that could make sync and async `BufferedProducer` codebase more consistent. Since they do not have an impact on functionality, I thought it would be better to submit them in follow up PR.\r\n\r\n# All SDK Contribution checklist:\r\n- [x] **The pull request does not introduce [breaking changes]**\r\n- [x] **CHANGELOG is updated for new features, bug fixes or other significant changes.**\r\n- [x] **I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines and Best Practices\r\n- [x] Title of the pull request is clear and informative.\r\n- [x] There are a small number of commits, each of which have an informative message.

If the datetime is not utc but has a timezone defined it will convert it to utc, otherwise it is assumed to be in UTC. An incorrect value results in an AttributeError.\r\n\r\nThe following Example creates 10 items at two different times. By using start time you can filter out the items created after the time recorded.\r\n```python\r\n    batchSize = 10\r\n    container = database.get_container_client(container_name)\r\n    create_random_items(container, batchSize)\r\n    sleep(1)\r\n    now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)\r\n    sleep(1)\r\n    create_random_items(container, batchSize)\r\n    change_feed_iter = container.query_items_change_feed(start_time=now)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug where change feed pulls in async clients were failing to fetch remaining pages and only returning the first one by removing the casting to Dict for response headers and keeping them as CIMultiDict type.\r\n\r\nThis PR was merged into [PR 35090](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/35090) Please refer to that PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# All SDK Contribution checklist:\r\n- [ ] **The pull request does not introduce [breaking changes]**\r\n- [ ] **CHANGELOG is updated for new features, bug fixes or other significant changes.**\r\n- [ ] **I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines and Best Practices\r\n- [ ] Title of the pull request is clear and informative.\r\n- [ ] There are a small number of commits, each of which have an informative message.

    "body": "This change aims to optimize the single-shot Block Blob upload (known-length uploads that are smaller than `max_single_put_size` (default 64 MiB)) by accomplishing two main goals:\r\n\r\n- We no longer pass raw data and the data stream to the `upload_block_blob` helper function, we only pass the stream. This will prevent us from keeping two instances of data in memory during the upload.\r\n- <del>Previously, if the raw data was a stream, we would read all data out of the stream to assert the data type inside the stream. This change makes it so we now use `read(0)` just to determine the type without advancing the stream and are able to pass the stream directly to the HTTP layer meaning the HTTP layer can stream the data properly.\r\n  - The only time we cannot do this is when the stream has an async read method as `aiohttp` requires streams to implement IOBase and most async streams will not. In this case we read the data out beforehand as we did previously.\r\n</del>\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes a couple of existing issues:\r\n- Fixes uploads with encryption using an Async iterator/generator which was previously broken.\r\n- Corrects the behavior of `Iterable[str]` for single-shot Block Blob upload. Previously, it would pass the raw string to the HTTP layer and the HTTP layer would attempt to upload with default encoding (`latin-1` for `requests`), which could be different than the encoding the customer chose (or fail outright). Now we properly pass the `IterStreamer` instance which properly handles encoding.\r\n- Corrected the type hint for `data` for `upload_blob`. It went from `Union[bytes, str, Iterable[AnyStr], IO[AnyStr]]` to `Union[bytes, str, Iterable[AnyStr], IO[bytes]]` as we do not support `IO[str]`. We do now properly support the rest though.",

Some context here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/27559#issuecomment-1954877542\r\n\r\nA user can still explicitly specify old versions with the `api_version` kwarg for each operation.

User-based authentication doesn't use these variables, so there's no reason to continue requiring them.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the preparer to handle unset variables when user auth is requested instead of failing with a KeyError, as well as unset corresponding `AZURE_*` variables accordingly. I debated whether we should unset missing variables or leave missing variables untouched, but settled on the former to make our behavior as consistent as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen the EnvironmentVariableLoader is used, the intent is to only use environment variables that begin with the service directory's prefix. When running KV tests, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, etc. are always set to `KEYVAULT_CLIENT_ID`, etc. If we stopped changing the value of `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` when `KEYVAULT_CLIENT_ID` is unset, that would be inconsistent and cause confusion if tests were to inspect `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and expect that it's set to a KV-specific value. Setting `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` to a placeholder value would also be inconsistent since we usually don't modify `KEYVAULT_CLIENT_ID` -- leaving the latter variable unset could be intentional, and we should reflect this in the former variable.\r\n\r\nIf any of these variables were unset in the past, the preparer would fail -- so any behavior updates are non-breaking in that sense.\r\n\r\n# All SDK Contribution checklist:\r\n- [x] **The pull request does not introduce [breaking changes]**\r\n- [x] **CHANGELOG is updated for new features, bug fixes or other significant changes.**\r\n- [x] **I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines and Best Practices\r\n- [x] Title of the pull request is clear and informative.\r\n- [x] There are a small number of commits, each of which have an informative message.

This started with just fixing the annoying toctree errors that were hiding the real sphinx errors for mgmt: `WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'azure.mgmt.agrifood'` \r\n\r\nThe reason for these errors stemmed from the fact that certain libraries were not added to the hardcoded package_service_mapping.json like the script expects them to be. And as a result we're generating mgmt libraries with no reference information at all. \r\n\r\nExample: https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-mgmt-recoveryservicessiterecovery/1.2.0/index.html\r\n\r\nSince the mgmt build for docs relies on a hardcoded package_service_mapping, anytime a new library releases, or an existing library releases with a new API version (with multiapi), it doesn't get captured by our github.io docs. This moves us away from using the hardcoded package_service_mapping and hardcoded multiapi mapping, so we always produce mgmt docs for any library version release.\r\n\r\nNote: I did a bit of refactoring, but did not change the way the docs are structured/render in github.io.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome test builds from this PR to compare with the current state of docs (you'll need to extract the docs from the build artifacts to do an apples to apples comparison):\r\n\r\n- No multiapi: [azure-mgmt-agrifood](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=3538343&view=results) | [current state](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-mgmt-agrifood/1.0.0b3/index.html)\r\n- Multiapi: [azure-mgmt-appconfiguration](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=3538357&view=results) | [current state](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-mgmt-appconfiguration/3.0.0/index.html)\r\n- Multiapi with subnamespaces: [azure-mgmt-resources](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=3538359&view=results) | [current state](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-mgmt-resource/23.1.0b2/index.html)",

We should use the version that it's in the prebuilt wheel dir.\r\n\r\nThis change merely allows that to happen, as `create_package_and_install` will do that if you don't FORCE IT to recreate the package as we were before.

    "body": "Due to a bug that was in uamqp when settling messages across the wire we sent dispositions to the service with `settled=True` by default. This caused our dispositions to model a \"fire and forget\" pattern where we never confirmed with the service if the messages had been settled and removed from the queue. This \"fire and forget\" pattern was also causing issues with locked-until-utc times on messages as we were not confirming that messages were being released by us back to the service. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changes to resolve this bug:\r\n\r\n- When sending dispositions now `settled=False`, this triggers us to have a transaction with the service that looks similar to as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<- TransferFrame(....\r\nCalling complete_messages()\r\n-> DispositionFrame(role=True, first=1, last=None, settled=False, state=Accepted(), batchable=None)\r\n<- DispositionFrame(role=False, first=1, last=None, settled=True, state={'accepted': []}, batchable=None)\r\nCompleted Msg\r\n```\r\n\r\n- This pr models sending/receiving dispositions over the `ReceiverLink` similar to how the `SenderLink` deals with the Acks for TransferFrames sent. \r\n- When a disposition is sent that is related to Message settlement, we add a MessageDelivery object to a list that contains all the disposition information. When a corresponding disposition is received for that Message settlement, we call an `on_disposition_received` callback that processes the response, raises any appropriate errors received from the service's DispFrame. If no error is raised message._settled=True. \r\n\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- Error Handling Scenarios\r\n- Should the inner exception be a MessageException?\r\n- Should process_receive_error have changes?\r\n- Do we need to consider Timeout on sending disposition?\r\n- Do we need to clear the list of dispositions when the link closes/detaches/errors? -- if we fallback to the mgmt_link we wont be sending an outgoing disposition so it wont be added the the list but we get an incoming so it will be removed.\r\n- Do we need wait_for_response?\r\n- Raising valueError in SendDispostion -Fixed\r\n- AmqpOverWebsockets seems to run faster than AMQP transport for this scenario\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In this scenario we can still perform crypto operations, and this is likely to be a real use case since these keys were requested for the purpose of offloading key material management to Key Vault.\r\n\r\nWhen these keys don't have local key material, we now raise a `ValueError` for methods that aren't supported; e.g. `private_numbers` or `public_bytes`. Instead of raising on `__eq__`, which could be problematic, we document that equality comparisons will always yield `False` when we don't have key material to compare with.\r\n\r\nThis also adds docstring documentation that discourages users from creating these key types directly, as they should be initialized with CryptographyClient methods.\r\n\r\nTo properly test this scenario, I made some fixes to our testing setup to correctly prevent clients from getting key material from KV. Our previous setup was ineffective after we migrated away from management-plane resource preparers.\r\n\r\nOne final change was to fix type hints for `tags` in KeyProperties and SecretProperties; these should be Optional.\r\n\r\n# All SDK Contribution checklist:\r\n- [x] **The pull request does not introduce [breaking changes]**\r\n- [x] **CHANGELOG is updated for new features, bug fixes or other significant changes.**\r\n- [x] **I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines and Best Practices\r\n- [x] Title of the pull request is clear and informative.\r\n- [x] There are a small number of commits, each of which have an informative message.

This can be made optionally be made strict.\r\n- Refactored v2 Workspace Connections to have no massive if-else statements to determine the type string-to-class mappings. All mappings are either explicitly defined in static dictionaries, or implicitly defined by accessor functions of subclasses.\r\n- Added/fixed some missing documentation here and there.\r\n- Workspace Connections now silently support None for credentials, since data connections tend to leave them unset when returned from the API.\r\n- Refactored v2 SDK unit tests to be smaller amounts of code per-test, and added some new tests to account for some new behaviors.\r\n- Surfaced the ApiKeyConfiguration (the api key credentials object) from an AI SDK's init file. This will allow users to fully construct AI connection objects without directly importing from the v2 SDK.\r\n- Added an include_data_connections flag to the list operation of both the v2 and AI SDK. It defaults to false.\r\n\r\nMissing stuff that would be expected:\r\n- Testing in the AI SDK. This is forthcoming in a separate PR due to issues in testing AI and SDK changes in CI simultaneously.\r\n\r\n",

This also happens if I write a corresponding .NET app.\n\nThe fix that I am proposing makes it work on my specific setup and hopefully breaks no one else. I understand if you are hesitant to take it. Let me know, I'll see how I can restore my setting.\n\nBut on the other hand, I don't think it makes anything worse, it only makes things more robust, so maybe take it?\n\n* Use [CultureInfo]::InvarialtCulture\n\nCo-authored-by: Wes Haggard <weshaggard@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* Update eng/common/scripts/Prepare-Release.ps1\n\n* Update eng/common/scripts/Prepare-Release.ps1\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Anton Kolesnyk <41349689+antkmsft@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Wes Haggard <weshaggard@users.noreply.github.com>"

One generated model -- `RoleDefinition` -- now has some properties nested under a `.properties` attribute, but there are otherwise no significant changes.

Using DPG means that we're using new HTTP request types, and our old method of request manipulation no longer works.

The change modifies the way the `user_log_fp` file is opened by adding the `utf-8` encoding. This ensures that the file is opened in a way that supports a wider range of characters.\r\n\r\n* [`sdk/ai/azure-ai-generative/azure/ai/generative/evaluate/_mlflow_log_collector.py`](diffhunk://#diff-df6965ac8714a99eff61788b05d2eb05c27ce0bae46811ee0e672c27f50e3ebeL33-R33): Modified the `open` function in the `__init__` method to include `utf-8` encoding when opening the `user_log_fp` file.

Because _all_ of the tox environments actually utilize the requirements from the `setup.py` to resolve their `azure` requirements to either a pip-downloaded wheel or a cached prebuilt wheel, this causes crashes in some non-deterministic set of the tox environments that run _after_ the `depends` check.\r\n\r\nDuring a `dev` build, all the requirements are coherent, and alpha versions are able to be installed. During a **non-dev** build, the `depends` package is unable to locate a package that matches the necessary version, causing it to update on the fly to the `alpha` dependency. While this works for the `depends` environment, the _other_ environments are attempting to install the prebuilt wheel from the `build` phase. THESE packages _do not_ have the on-the-fly updated dev specifiers, and as such are attempting to satisfy `azure-ai-ml>=1.13.0b1` with `azure-ai-ml1.13.0aXXXX`. This obviously conflicts, and cannot be resolved.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves this problem by making it consistent in either direction. During a dev build, the packages at rest have their requirements updated to alpha version if necessary. Otherwise, they are _left alone_ and the prebuilt wheel dir should have everything they need.\r\n\r\n[`python - ai` Dev Build](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3436067&view=results)\r\n[`python - ai` Non-Dev Build](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3436068&view=results)\r\n\r\n[`python - storage` Dev Build](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3436239&view=results)\r\n[`python - storage` Non-Dev Build](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3436240&view=results)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is only acceptable if both of these pass.\r\n\r\n",

These were exported via `__all__` but also already exposed through the non-`aio` namespace, which sphinx was unhappy with.\r\n\r\nWe still need the types to be importable from there to preserve existing behavior, so this PR removes these types from `__all__` and supports imports dynamically with `__getattr__`. Tests verify that imports from `aio` still work while also satisfying sphinx checks.\r\n\r\n# All SDK Contribution checklist:\r\n- [x] **The pull request does not introduce [breaking changes]**\r\n- [x] **CHANGELOG is updated for new features, bug fixes or other significant changes.**\r\n- [x] **I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\r\n\r\n## General Guidelines and Best Practices\r\n- [x] Title of the pull request is clear and informative.\r\n- [x] There are a small number of commits, each of which have an informative message.

They need to correct the spec path before releasing GA packages.\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem that is addressed by this PR\r\nAdded a pipeline from common template to release pipeline to validate the REST API specification location is from the main branch of [Azure/azure-rest-api-spec](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs). \r\n\r\nThis validation will be skipped if the package to be released is non-GA package. \r\n\r\n### Provide a list of related PRs\r\nThe common script and pipeline were merged by another PR.\r\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/pull/7451\r\n\r\nFYI - The same change has been added to other language repos' release pipelines.\r\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/40783\r\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/38332\r\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/28303\r\n",

This is due to the fact that building a wheel generates artifacts on the drive in the folder path of the package, and having multiple processes attempt at the same time causes conflicts with these artifacts.\r\n\r\n## After this change\r\n\r\nAs part of CI, we replace relative deps with prebuilt wheels to avoid _exactly these non-deterministic errors_. This pr will utilize this _same prebuilt dir_ to attempt to resolve a dep BEFORE falling back to the relative dep in the repo.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "When testing the Image Analysis on a clean Ubuntu VM, the asynchronous samples failed to run, with an error indicating a package is missing. Installing the `aiohttp` package and re-running the samples solved the problem.\r\n\r\nThis led me to investigate why, and find out that `aiohttp` is listed as an optional dependency in azure-core package, not a required dependency. See these lines in [/sdk/core/azure-core/setup.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/setup.py#L77)\r\n```python\r\n    extras_require={\r\n        \"aio\": [\r\n            \"aiohttp>=3.0\",\r\n        ],\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe PR updates the package README and samples README to mention the need to install `aiohttp` if you use the async client.\r\n\r\nAlso update the `run_all_samples.ps1` script such that it works both on Windows and Linux.",

    "body": "Addresses part of https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/33256\r\n\r\nThis adds a `ci_enabled` flag to the pyproject.toml configuration. It defaults to `True`. If a service sets `ci_enabled = false`, analyze checks and tests will be disabled when running a Manual or internal build. Pull request builds will continue to run all checks in order to prevent code being checked in on a failing pipeline. Special case: release builds will fail if `ci_enabled=false` to prevent a package release without checks running.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**: As we work towards enabling some checks like mypy, strict_sphinx, etc. it is evident that not all libraries will be compliant at deadlines. We still want to turn these checks to mandatory for all libraries, but not at the expense of breaking a ton of library pipelines and impacting pipeline health. This pyproject.toml option will allow us to disable failing pipelines, but still perform validation at Pull Request time to ensure failing checks get addressed before code changes are made. It also makes more clear/trackable which pipelines are disabled (rather than disabling under the DevOps pipeline settings) and easy to turn back on when an owner is ready to address issues.\r\n\r\n**Pending work / Not addressed in this PR**: Right now we disable analyze checks and tests, but the skip is done *after* we allocate resources to create the jobs. To fully implement this, when the config is set, we shouldn't waste resources and just skip spinning up the entire job.\r\n\r\n**Test runs** (using metricsadvisor as an example where we do want to skip checks):\r\n\r\n- PR `- ci` run: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=3326875&view=results\r\n    - Expected: All checks run\r\n- Manual `- ci` run: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=3327018&view=results\r\n    - Expected: Analyze checks and tests skipped\r\n- Manual or scheduled internal (release) run: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3327024&view=results\r\n    - Expected: Analyze checks and tests skipped\r\n- Manual or scheduled internal (`- tests`) run: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3327023&view=results\r\n    - Expected: Analyze checks and tests skipped\r\n\r\n**Test release**\r\n\r\n- ci_enabled = true: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3333464&view=results\r\n    - Expected: Successful release\r\n- ci_enabled = false: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=3333587&view=logs&j=7bb69cc7-6f52-585e-8b13-5bae7c4a9fa4&t=66ec37bc-d774-526e-7316-aa88863bcdc6\r\n    - Expected: Block on release in the `Verify CI enabled` step",

If the path is a glob, is it valid and does it have matches in the repository? \r\n- Owners - There are several verifications for owners:\r\n    - Does the owner, individual or team, have write access (every team/individual in a CODEOWNERS file needs to have write access, this is a GitHub thing).\r\n    - Is the owner public? Individuals need to set their Azure membership to public.

The root cause is that in our [path-building](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-share/azure/storage/fileshare/_directory_client.py#L292), we don't check for an empty \"main\" directory name. This causes a `/` to appear as part of a file-name, and so gets caught as an illegal character.\r\n\r\n This change simply makes it so that the \"subdirectory\" client obtained when the \"main\" directory is pointing to the root will make a directory in the root as expected (rather than throw an illegal character exception).\r\n\r\nThis mimics the current behavior that calling `get_file_client` and creating a file from a directory_client pointing to the root as it's directory will place the file right in the root.\r\n\r\nThis issue does not seem to reproduce in any other `get_X_client` as the logic used to obtain the directory path is different in other cases.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Should add a changelog entry for \"bug fixes\" for this",
