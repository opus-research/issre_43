Mention the issue number here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Firefox, alert displayed just before blurring an element dispatches the native blur event twice which tripped the jQuery logic if a jQuery blur handler was not attached before the trigger call.\r\n\r\nThis was because the `leverageNative` logic part for triggering first checks if setup was done before (which, for example, is done if a jQuery handler was registered before for this element+event pair) and - if it was not - adds a dummy handler that just returns `true`. The `leverageNative` logic makes that `true` then saved into private data, replacing the previous `saved` array. Since `true` passes the truthy check, the second native inner handler treated `true` as an array, crashing on the `slice` call.\r\n\r\nSince it's impossible to call `alert()` in unit tests, simulate the issue by replacing the `addEventListener` method on a test button with a version that calls attached blur handlers twice.\r\n\r\nFixes gh-5459\r\nRef gh-5236\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [x] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\r\n* ~~If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com~~\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

Mention the issue number here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe HTML spec defines boolean attributes:\r\nhttps://html.spec.whatwg.org/#boolean-attributes\r\nthat often correlate with boolean properties. If the attribute is missing, it correlates with the `false` property value, if it's present - the `true` property value. The only valid values are an empty string or the attribute name.\r\n\r\njQuery tried to be helpful here and treated boolean attributes in a special way in the `.attr()` API:\r\n1. For the getter, as long as the attribute was present, it was returning the attribute name lowercased, ignoring the value.\r\n2. For the setter, it was removing the attribute when `false` was passed; otherwise, it was ignoring the passed value and set the attribute - interestingly, in jQuery `>=3` not lowercased anymore.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the spec occasionally converts boolean attributes into ones with additional attribute values with special behavior - one such example is the new `\"until-found\"` value for the `hidden` attribute. Our setter normalization means passing those values is impossible with jQuery.

Mention the issue number here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe HTML spec defines boolean attributes:\r\nhttps://html.spec.whatwg.org/#boolean-attributes\r\nthat often correlate with boolean properties. If the attribute is missing, it correlates with the `false` property value, if it's present - the `true` property value. The only valid values are an empty string or the attribute name.\r\n\r\njQuery tried to be helpful here and treated boolean attributes in a special way in the `.attr()` API:\r\n1. For the getter, as long as the attribute was present, it was returning the attribute name lowercased, ignoring the value.\r\n2. For the setter, it was removing the attribute when `false` was passed; otherwise, it was ignoring the passed value and set the attribute - interestingly, in jQuery `>=3` not lowercased anymore.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the spec occasionally converts boolean attributes into ones with additional attribute values with special behavior - one such example is the new `\"until-found\"` value for the `hidden` attribute. Our setter normalization means passing those values is impossible with jQuery.\r\n\r\nThis patch takes a conservative approach, with backwards compatibility in mind, and makes the following changes:\r\n1. It explicitly only applies the logic to the few most popular attribute names.\r\n2. The getter only normalizes the empty string to the lowercased name, returning other attribute values unchanged - it seems unlikely that the empty string value will ever mean anything else than the attribute name repeated.\r\n3. The setter continues to treat `false` as mean attribute removal and `true` as setting the value to the attribute name. All the other inputs are aplied unchanged.\r\n\r\nWith this change, all existing jQuery unit tests were already passing.\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [ ] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\r\n* [ ] If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

      "The following look great:\r\n* Expose private key as \"secret\" rather than as \"environment var\", that way we control when it becomes visible, thus not making it visible during earlier steps.\r\n* Install ssh key not until after install/build steps.\r\n* Further limit secrets to a declared group (confusingly called \"enviornment\"), and the job to a given branch.\r\n\r\nThe following could tighten it further:\r\n* Configure the secret in the repo setting by branch (i.e. protected-only, or list \"main\" there). This because as-is the restriction is in the file itself, which feels insufficient. I.e. if it is modified to allow branch X and pushed to X, or if another job is modified to enable the same \"filestash\" group secrets, that would bypass it. Putting the restriction also/instead in the repo settings would harden this.\r\n* Consider removing use of [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) when the purpose of a build isn't to test specific or multiple Node.js versions. This action is pretty convoluted and heavy. The ubuntu image already comes with an LTS version of nodejs pre-installed. For Ubuntu 22 (ubuntu-22, ubuntu-latest) that is currently Node.js 18. https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/ubuntu22/20240218.1/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md.

We've achieved that by limiting our dependency list to ones that are unlikely to drop support any time soon. The new dependency list includes:\r\n\r\n- `qunit` (our trusty unit testing library)\r\n- `selenium-webdriver` (for spinning up local browsers)\r\n- `express` (for starting a test server and adding middleware)\r\n  - express middleware includes uses of `body-parser` and `raw-body`\r\n- `yargs` (for constructing a CLI with pretty help text)\r\n- BrowserStack (for running each of our QUnit modules separately in all of our supported browsers)\r\n  - `browserstack-local` (for opening a local tunnel. This is the same package still currently used in the new Browserstack SDK)\r\n  - We are not using any other BrowserStack library. The newest BrowserStack SDK does not fit our needs (and isn't open source). Existing libraries, such as `node-browserstack` or `browserstack-runner`, either do not quite fit our needs, are under-maintained and out-of-date, or are not robust enough to meet all of our requirements. We instead call the [BrowserStack REST API](https://github.com/browserstack/api) directly.\r\n\r\n**BrowserStack**\r\n- automatically retries individual modules in case of test failure(s)\r\n- automatically attempts to re-establish broken tunnels\r\n- automatically refreshes the page in case a test run has stalled\r\n- Browser workers are reused when running isolated modules in the same browser\r\n- runs all browsers concurrently and uses as many sessions as are available under the BrowserStack plan. It will wait for available sessions if there are none.\r\n- supports filtering the available list of browsers by browser name, browser version, device, OS, and OS version (see `npm run test:unit -- --list-browsers` for more info). It will retrieve the latest matching browser available if any of those parameters are not specified. Supports latest and latest-\\d+ in place of browser version.\r\n- cleans up after itself (closes the local tunnel, stops the test server, etc.)\r\n- Requires `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.\r\n\r\n**Selenium**\r\n- supports running any local browser as long as the driver is installed, including support for headless mode in Chrome, FF, and Edge\r\n- supports running `basic` tests on the latest [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#readme), which can be seen in action in this PR (see `test:browserless`)\r\n- Node tests will run as before in PRs and all non-dependabot branches, but now includes tests on real Safari in a GH actions macos image instead of playwright-webkit.\r\n- can run multiple browsers and multiple modules concurrently\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n- Stale dependencies have been removed and all remaining dependencies have been upgraded with a few exceptions:\r\n  - `sinon`: stopped supporting IE in version 10. But, `sinon` has been updated to 9.x.\r\n  - `husky`: latest does not support Node 10 and runs on `npm install`. Needed for now until git builds are migrated to GitHub Actions.\r\n  - `rollup`: latest does not support Node 10. Needed for now until git builds are migrated to GitHub Actions.\r\n- BrowserStack tests are set to run on each `main` branch commit\r\n- `debug` mode leaves Selenium browsers open whether they pass or fail and leaves browsers with test failures open on BrowserStack. The latter is to avoid leaving open too many sessions.\r\n- This PR includes a workflow to dispatch BrowserStack runs on-demand\r\n- The Node version used for most workflow tests has been upgraded to 20.x\r\n- updated supportjQuery to 3.7.1\r\n\r\nRun `npm run test:unit -- --help` for CLI documentation\r\n\r\nClose gh-5427"

Mention the issue number here.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a complete rework of our testing infrastructure. The main goal is to modernize and drop deprecated or undermaintained dependencies (specifically, grunt, karma, and testswarm). We've achieved that by limiting our dependency list to ones that are unlikely to drop support any time soon. The new dependency list includes:\r\n\r\n- `qunit` (our trusty unit testing library)\r\n- `selenium-webdriver` (for spinning up local browsers)\r\n- `express` (for starting a test server and adding middleware)\r\n  - express middleware includes uses of `body-parser` and `raw-body`\r\n- `yargs` (for constructing a CLI with pretty help text)\r\n- BrowserStack (for running each of our QUnit modules separately in all of our supported browsers)\r\n  - `browserstack-local` (for opening a local tunnel. This is the same package still currently used in the new Browserstack SDK)\r\n  - We are not using any other BrowserStack library. The newest BrowserStack SDK does not fit our needs (and isn't open source). Existing libraries, such as `node-browserstack` or `browserstack-runner`, either do not quite fit our needs, are under-maintained and out-of-date, or are not robust enough to meet all of our requirements. We instead call the [BrowserStack REST API](https://github.com/browserstack/api) directly.\r\n\r\n## BrowserStack Runner\r\n- automatically retries individual modules in case of test failure(s)\r\n- automatically attempts to re-establish broken tunnels\r\n- automatically refreshes the page in case a test run has stalled\r\n- runs all browsers concurrently and uses as many sessions as are available under the BrowserStack plan. It will wait for available sessions if there are none.\r\n- supports filtering the available list of browsers by browser name, browser version, device, OS, and OS version (see `npm run test:unit -- --list-browsers` for more info). It will retrieve the latest matching browser available if any of those parameters are not specified.\r\n- cleans up after itself (closes the local tunnel, stops the test server, etc.)\r\n- Requires `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Selenium Runner\r\n- supports running any local browser as long as the driver is installed, including support for headless mode in Chrome, FF, and Edge\r\n- supports running `basic` tests on the latest [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#readme), which can be seen in action in this PR (see `test:browserless`)\r\n- Node tests will run as before in PRs and all non-dependabot branches, but now includes tests on real Safari in a GH actions macos image instead of playwright-webkit.\r\n- can run multiple browsers and multiple modules concurrently\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n- Stale dependencies have been removed and all remaining dependencies have been upgraded with a few exceptions:\r\n  - `sinon`: stopped supporting IE in version 10. But, `sinon` has been updated to 9.x.\r\n  - `husky`: latest does not support Node 10 and runs on `npm install`. Needed for now until git builds are migrated to GitHub Actions.\r\n  - `rollup`: latest does not support Node 10. Needed for now until git builds are migrated to GitHub Actions.\r\n- BrowserStack tests are set to run on each `main` branch commit\r\n- `debug` mode leaves Selenium browsers open whether they pass or fail and leaves browsers with test failures open on BrowserStack. The latter is to avoid leaving open too many sessions.\r\n- This PR includes a workflow to dispatch BrowserStack runs on-demand\r\n- The Node version used for most workflow tests has been upgraded to 20.x\r\n- updated supportjQuery to 3.7.1\r\n\r\nRun `npm run test:unit -- --help` for CLI documentation or view the [command.js file](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c0297908223d1d305bc820e2b8fd02c06cd8f9cd/test/runner/command.js) directly.\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [x] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\r\n* [x] If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

      "~That manipulation test in firefox might be flakey.~ Nvm, I think it might have to do with my changes to `parentUrl`. ~Not sure why it only affects FF using selenium if so yet (does not affect FF on browserstack).~ browserstack uses the special domain `bs-local.com`, so it skips this test due to it not being on localhost. I tried a browserstack run with the manip test enabled. It passed the first time, but not the second, so I think it's still flakey. I went back to skipping unless local.\r\n\r\nAdded back `parentUrl`. I used `host` and `protocol` instead of `origin`, just in case. ",

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>.

      "Thanks for the PR but I don't think the proposed changes are correct. Bundlers work differently than Node and they're perfectly able to load an ESM module via a CommonJS `require` as well as load a CommonJS module via an ESM `import`. Also, it's very important to avoid loading two different copies of jQuery which is why `node.import` points to a special wrapper over CommonJS and not the full ESM module.\r\n\r\nIs there any concrete issue you're facing with Webpack or just a feeling that the setup is not what you expected? I'd prefer if we focused on real issues here; I spent a lot of time thinking about this setup and discussing it with experts in the area; any changes to this setup should be a result of real demonstrable issues.",
      "Also, please sign our CLA, it's a hard requirement for us to accept any PRs.",
      "Correct, I understood problem of \"two copies\" just few minutes after this PR ( in fact, I returned here to close it).\r\nThe issue is this one:\r\n`import $ from 'jquery'` -> $ is JQuery function, the default export\r\n`$ = require('jquery')` -> $ is whole ESModule object.\r\nTo have $ function, the statement would be `$ = require('jquery').default` but that require is in a lot of  libraries.\r\nThe reason of this behavior is how node converts ESM modules in CJS when uses the *require* function. \r\n(it's Babel?)\r\n",
      "Can you post a full test case with detailed instructions on how to run it? I don’t think we’ll be able to proceed until we have it; there are too many edge cases here to be able to act just on reading incomplete code snippets.",
      "https://github.com/cocco111/jQuery4Test\r\nIf you prefer you can simply open `/dist/index.html` in a browser and see result in console.",
      "Thanks for the test case, I think I understand the issue now. The fact that we started exporting more than a single thing from jQuery - apart from the `default` export we have `$` & `jQuery` named tokens pointing to the same thing - also makes Webpack treat `require( \"jquery\" )` as a way to export the full module instead of just the jQuery object...\r\n\r\nLet me create an issue out of it. The PR as it stands is not going to work due to state duplication but we need to think how to handle this.",

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>.

Currently file coverage information for each of these pairs of languages is grouped together. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1903\">#1903</a></li>\n<li>Add a warning to help customers avoid inadvertently analyzing the same CodeQL language in multiple matrix jobs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1901\">#1901</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.8 - 19 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.10.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 12 September 2023 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6, and will be unsupported by the next minor release of the CodeQL Action. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1884\">#1884</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.10.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.9.5 and 2.10.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.21.7</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Enable the following language aliases when using CodeQL 2.14.4 and later: <code>c-cpp</code> for C/C++ analysis, <code>java-kotlin</code> for Java/Kotlin analysis, and <code>javascript-typescript</code> for JavaScript/TypeScript analysis. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1883\">#1883</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.7 - 14 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1882\">#1882</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.6 - 13 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Better error message when there is a failure to determine the merge base of the code to analysis. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1860\">#1860</a></li>\n<li>Improve the calculation of default amount of RAM used for query execution on GitHub Enterprise Server. This now reduces in proportion to the runner's total memory to better account for system memory usage, helping to avoid out-of-memory failures on larger runners. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1866\">#1866</a></li>\n<li>Enable improved file coverage information for GitHub Enterprise Server users.

The leading space is intentional to avoid any possible collisions.\r\n- compare_size was removed the banner for comparisons, but @mgol made me realize all the exclusions can make a noticeable difference in the size so should be included. However, the short SHA varies by commit and we'd like to be able to compare exactly across commits. Also, `.dirty` is removed for comparisons because we'd like to be able to compare local changes (i.e. dirty git directory\") to all branches and last runs that were clean.\r\n- Added a version number check that will automatically rewrite the cache on version mismatch.\r\n\r\nI can make another PR if preferred, but I tacked on another change here to add the factory files that were just added to the main branch to the dist eslint.\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [x] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\r\n* [x] If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

      "Thanks for the PR. However, I think we should actually go in an opposite direction. `class2type` is used internally for the `toType` helper so we only need values that we use there. In jQuery 3.x, however, `toType` is exposed via `jQuery.type` so we need to preserve the API. In jQuery 4.x we have an opportunity to trim it a bit.\r\n\r\nThat means for jQuery 4.x there's no reason to add a BigInt to the list if we don't treat it in any special way. And for jQuery 3.x there's no need since `jQuery.type` is deprecated and we don't need to improve this API too much.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to treat BigInt in some special way in jQuery, feel free to propose it in an issue but any such support will likely require many more code changes."

Mention the issue number here.\r\n-->\r\nMigrates most grunt tasks to npm scripts.\r\n\r\nWhile there are a lot of changes, the only change to the built jQuery file is the version string. See below for full details. \r\n\r\nI've tried to mostly keep the commits to one per task, but there are some early commits migrating the lint task in steps and some later commits to combine certain tasks (i.e. build, minify, dist, and compare_size) and simplify them. Here are some important things to notes:\r\n\r\n- Added a new build command using [yargs](https://yargs.js.org/) to parse command line arguments and provide a pretty help command.\r\n- minify and dist always run with a build.\r\n- With `grunt npmcopy` removed, I committed the package-lock.json. We could actually commit a yarn.lock as well if we want. npm now updates both.\r\n- The new watch task takes advantage of rollup's watcher directly. I've removed the copying functionality from the dist task, which now only fulfills its original purpose of making sure output is ascii-only and doesn't contain carriage returns. I think the copying was added very early on to copy builds to a dropbox folder to test things on jsfiddle. Fortunately, if that's still needed, the build command-and therefore the watch task-can write to any directory and multiple can be run at once.\r\n- I've written a simplified version of compare_size that now lives in the jQuery repo and has no non-node dependencies other than `chalk` for pretty terminal colors. It uses [Node's zlib](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/zlib.html) directly instead of gzip-js or another npm package. gzip-js hasn't been touched in years. Fortunately, zlib is easy-to-use. Sizes are a bit larger than before using the default options, but that should be okay as we're looking for comparisons, not completely accurate size predictions.\r\n- I've moved the tests that don't require karma off of grunt. This includes the promises tests and node smoke tests.\r\n- I removed the necessary grunt tasks all together in the last commit\r\n- As I mentioned in the meeting, I've temporarily disabled an eslint-plugin-import rule (no-unused-imports) until the plugin [supports the new flat config format](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2556).\r\n- the authors task, to replace grunt-git-authors, is already migrated in another PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5306\r\n\r\n**Version string**\r\n\r\nThe version string now includes a short SHA when the build is not a release build (e.g. `4.0.0-pre+SHA`). Also, I made the version follow semver syntax. So, the slim version would now be `4.0.0+slim`. In a non-release build, that would look like `4.0.0-pre+slim.SHA`. Custom builds still add excluded/included modules to the version string (when not the slim build), but I didn't bother adding those in a way that follows semver syntax (e.g. `4.0.0-pre+a85a6aa2 -ajax,-ajax/binary,etc`). I'd like to remove `-pre` as well, but that change has already been made in my release PR (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5306).\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [x] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\r\n* [x] If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

I'll need to think on the best way to fix this.~ Should be good now. Turns out `concurrently` has `yargs` as a dependency. yargs requires Node >=12, so it can't be used in the pretest script on Node 10.",

It's debatable whether we need to commit the dist files on the tag commit, but since we are, they need to be removed in a subsequent commit when doing it on the branch.\r\n  * Sort of related to the subsequent commit, I lean towards not updating the version back to a `-pre` version. It's a practice we invented and have been doing a long time, but I'm not sure is actually necessary. It simplifies some release-it steps to not do it, which bases it's automatic version detection on the assumption that the version in package.json is the last version released. Besides, our `-pre` version is often wrong anyway (for instance, when the next version is going to be a minor or major instead of a patch). If jquery-git.js is a concern, it does already include the SHA in the header and I think we could remove the version there completely.\r\n\r\n*cdn*\r\n- clone cdn repo, copy files, and commit/push\r\n- create versioned and unversioned copies in cdn/\r\n  * Intentionally moved out of the dist/ folder.

This will help to avoid out-of-memory failures on larger runners. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1760\">#1760</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1762\">#1762</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.20.3 - 06 Jul 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1743\">#1743</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.20.2 - 03 Jul 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.20.1 - 21 Jun 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1721\">#1721</a></li>\n<li>Experimental: add a new <code>resolve-environment</code> action which attempts to infer a configuration for the build environment that is required to build a given project.

Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.20.0 - 13 Jun 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump the version of the Action to 2.20.0. This ensures that users who received a Dependabot upgrade to <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/cdcdbb579706841c47f7063dda365e292e5cad7a\"><code>cdcdbb5</code></a>, which was mistakenly marked as Action version 2.13.4, continue to receive updates to the CodeQL Action. Full details in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1729\">#1729</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.6 - 01 Jun 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1698\">#1698</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.5 - 25 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow invalid URIs to be used as values to <code>artifactLocation.uri</code> properties. This reverses a change from <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a> that inadvertently led to stricter validation of some URI values. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1705\">#1705</a></li>\n<li>Gracefully handle invalid URIs when fingerprinting. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1694\">#1694</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.4 - 24 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema file to the latest from <a href=\"https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/123e95847b13fbdd4cbe2120fa5e33355d4a042b/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json\">oasis-tcs/sarif-spec</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a></li>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May 2023 that will disable Python dependency installation for new users of the CodeQL Action. This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1676\">#1676</a></li>\n<li>We are improving the way that <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">CodeQL bundles</a> are tagged to make it possible to easily identify bundles by their CodeQL semantic version. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1682\">#1682</a>\n<ul>\n<li>As of CodeQL CLI 2.13.4, CodeQL bundles will be tagged using semantic versions, for example <code>codeql-bundle-v2.13.4</code>, instead of timestamps, like <code>codeql-bundle-20230615</code>.</li>\n<li>This change does not affect the majority of workflows, and we will not be changing tags for existing bundle releases.</li>\n<li>Some workflows with custom logic that depends on the specific format of the CodeQL bundle tag may need to be updated. For example, if your workflow matches CodeQL bundle tag names against a <code>codeql-bundle-yyyymmdd</code> pattern, you should update it to also recognize <code>codeql-bundle-vx.y.z</code> tags.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the requirement for <code>on.push</code> and <code>on.pull_request</code> to trigger on the same branches. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1675\">#1675</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.3 - 04 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1664\">#1664</a></li>\n<li>You can now configure CodeQL within your code scanning workflow by passing a <code>config</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action. See <a href=\"https://aka.ms/code-scanning-docs/config-file\">Using a custom configuration file</a> for more information about configuring code scanning. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1590\">#1590</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.2 - 27 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.1 - 26 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.0 - 21 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1649\">#1649</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Mention the issue number here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a `3.x-stable` version of #5206\r\n\r\n`CSS.supports( \"selector(...)\" )` has different semantics than selectors passed to `querySelectorAll`. Apart from the fact that the former returns `false` for unrecognized selectors and the latter throws, `qSA` is more forgiving and accepts some invalid selectors, auto-correcting them where needed - for example, mismatched brackers are auto-closed. This behavior difference is breaking for many users.\r\n\r\nTo add to that, a recent CSSWG resolution made `:is()` & `:where()` the only pseudos with forgiving parsing; browsers are in the process of making `:has()` parsing unforgiving.\r\n\r\nTaking all that into account, we go back to our previous try-catch approach without relying on `CSS.supports( \"selector(...)\" )`. The only difference is we detect forgiving parsing in `:has()` and mark the selector as buggy.\r\n\r\nThe PR also updates `playwright-webkit` so that we test against a version of WebKit that already has non-forgiving `:has()`.\r\n\r\nFixes gh-5194\r\nRef gh-5098\r\nRef gh-5107\r\nRef w3c/csswg-drafts#7676\r\n\r\n-46 bytes\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [ ] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\r\n* [x] Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes\r\n* ~~If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com~~\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

This WIP is no longer needed, the PR contains all the relevant details with test cases.\r\n\r\nOne important change from this POC is that I ended up just defining a single entry point for Node.js. This is because our compiled ESM version still only has a default export with the value of `module.exports` from the regular file - which is just what Node.js does natively if you `import` a CommonJS module from an ESM one. Using a single file allows to avoid the dual package hazard altogether."

Mention the issue number here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHi there, as you may know, Chrome/ium has been lately aggressively throttling background tabs, this may result in those setTimeout()-based promises/deferreds to never resolve until the tab becomes active again.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt to prevent that, by using [queueMicrotask](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/queueMicrotask) under browsers supporting it. Also, the logic has been changed to dispatch those processes in bulk instead of individually, since the main reason for that throttling seems to be by having too many concurrent setTimeout()s running.\r\n\r\nThis implements a new `jQuery.asap()` function that will use either `queueMicrotask` or `setTimeout` for older browsers.\r\n\r\nI've observed that around this whole codebase there are several other uses of that `window.setTimeout( func )` pattern so perhaps I should move this `jQuery.asap()` elsewhere to be used in place of those as well (as part of another PR) ?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [ ] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\r\n* [ ] Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes\r\n* [ ] If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

The same goes for the colon, and for moving down the `var rtrim` to right above `jQuery.trim` assignment. Maybe a later change I made ended up making it smaller such that it also implicitly grew by a byte and thus making an earlier change redundant.

      "Thanks for the PR. Please sign our CLA before we review it.",
      "I have signed it twice today, but it still says that it is missing.",
      "The discussion in gh-1735 is pretty old. In that ticket the reason I was referring to the EventListener interface as \"low-level\" was because I thought it might be useful to use it as a foundation for existing jQuery functionality without exposing EventListener directly in the API. If it's exposed as a top-level ability with `.on()` (as in, \"an EventListener object can be passed instead of a function\") then it would probably prevent us from using EventListener for the internal low-level implementation.\r\n\r\nI think there may be some other cases and design issues that need to be considered here, especially since we're looking to support new features like passive listeners or the capture phase in jQuery 4. (Passive listeners in particular seem to be something that people want, most likely because Chrome's console complains about them incessantly.) \r\n\r\nAssuming those issues are resolved or not relevant, the spec says:\r\n\r\n> When a Node is copied using the cloneNode method the EventListeners attached to the source Node are not attached to the copied Node. If the user wishes the same EventListeners to be added to the newly created copy the user must add them manually.\r\n\r\nHowever, jQuery's `.clone()` method supports cloning with copying data and/or events. I'm not sure if this PR handles that and it would be good to have a test to ensure it does when the handler is an EventListener object.",
      "Also I just realized that the [Mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) seem to indicate the object with `handleEvent` is for compatibility, which isn't a good signal for adding new support:\r\n\r\n> Note: Due to the need for compatibility with legacy content, EventListener accepts both a function and an object with a handleEvent() property function. This is shown in the [example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener#example) below.",
      "> it would probably prevent us from using EventListener for the internal low-level implementation\r\n\r\nPlease explain.  This PR does not actually pass around and repeatedly accommodate `EventListener` objects, it supplants it with a bound `handleEvent` function.\r\n\r\n> we're looking to support new features like passive listeners or the capture phase in jQuery 4.\r\n\r\nThis solution only affects the second parameter to `addEventListener`.  Implementating event capturing or passive listeners is not affected by this.  I know this because I had to develop my own `EventTarget` before (taking into account phases, bubbling, capturing, etc.).\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure if this PR handles that and it would be good to have a test to ensure it does when the handler is an EventListener object.\r\n\r\nAgain, this solution is merely a function binding.  I can look into adding a unit test to demonstrate `.clone()` with `withDataAndEvents` set to true, but I don't see how that necessary since a bound member function is just a function.\r\n\r\n> compatibility...isn't a good signal for adding new support\r\n\r\n`EventListener` is not legacy, it is good design and forethought.  `EventListener` being around for 22 years and being around 11 years before `.on()` was added to jQuery is a good signal for compliance.  That example on Mozilla's website does not even attempt to demonstrate the advantages `EventListener`s have over callback functions (this PR's unit test does a better job of demonstrating how `this` object having contextual members).  For starters, callback event handlers usually make (strong) references to outside identifiers (because they have no context of their own), but `EventListener`s encourage code reuse and facilitate testability (by explicitly encapsulating the event handlers behavior).\r\n\r\nI rapid develop using `.on()` with callback event handlers, but after the event/behavior relationships are formalized into `EventListener` event delegates, I either have to drop `.on()` in favor of `.addEventListener` or use something like:\r\n```\r\nfunction bindEventListener( evtListener ) {\r\n\treturn evtListener.handleEvent.bind( evtListener );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut why?\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Contrived example.\r\nclass VisitedControl {\r\n\tconstructor( { displayElem } ) {\r\n\t\tthis.visitCount = 0;\r\n\t\tthis.displayElem = displayElem;\r\n\t}\r\n\thandleEvent( evt ) {\r\n\t\t++this.visitCount;\r\n\t\tjQuery( this.displayElem ).text( this.visitCount );\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n// Works with the `.on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler )` signature.\r\njQuery( \"button\" ).on( \"click\", bindEventListener( new VisitedControl( { displayElem: \"#button-count\" } ) ) );\r\n// Also works with the `.on( events [, selector ] [, data ] )` signature.\r\njQuery( \"input\" ).on( \"blur\", { handler: bindEventListener( new VisitedControl( { displayElem: \"#input-count\" } ) ) } );\r\n```",

For starters, callback event handlers usually make (strong) references to outside identifiers\r\n\r\nThe way it's implemented it in this PR nullifies that advantage as there's a strong reference to the handler, it's the handler that's being saved. To be able to fully utilize this, we'd have to actually store the object, not the handler and this should be confirmed by unit tests checking if swapping `handleEvent` for another callback after registration is respected. We'd probably have to create our own `EventListener` wrappers when a function is provided as a handler to unify the way we store handlers.\r\n\r\n> This solution only affects the second parameter to `addEventListener`. Implementating event capturing or passive listeners is not affected by this.\r\n\r\nWe realize this but when you take above into account, there's a lot more complexity to it. Implementing support for passive events requires us to do a significant refactor of our event module while making sure the test suite passes with as few breaking changes as possible. This is just not a good moment to add new significant features like this one. When the refactor is done, we can return to the subject if it's not already handled by the refactor.",

      "Thanks for opening a pull request! It seems we forgot to change our use of splice when [removing it from the jQuery object](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4473). We did take care of sort and push, just not splice. I'm surprised our tests didn't catch this, but we're going to need to add a test.\r\n\r\nSomething like the case in the jsbin will work fine to get duplicates on the jQuery object (i.e. `jQuery('body div').find('div')`). A relatively pointless call to `find` as it won't find anything new, but it does the job here of inserting duplicates. That said, there are a lot of divs on the test page, so it would be good to limit it to smaller selection. Something like `jQuery(\"#moretests div\").find(\"div\")` should work.\r\n\r\nAlso, splice should be its own var file, just like with [sort](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/src/var/sort.js)\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "@bubbatls Sure, no problem. Let us know if you hit any roadblocks.",
      "yes, the test you write is the most unit one about this issue, and the method name is uniqueSort so, checking the \"unique\" is completely relevant.\r\n\r\nBut I agree that another one covering more code by doing the .find('div').find('div') is worth being written for potential future regression.\r\n\r\nThis test should be written in the test/unit/selector.js file?\r\n",
      "> This test should be written in the test/unit/selector.js file?\r\n\r\nYes, the both tests should be written in ~~`test/unit/core.js`~~ `test/unit/selector.js` but in separate `QUnit.test` blocks as they're testing two different things.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I made a typo and I mentioned ~~`test/unit/core.js`~~ instead of the proper `test/unit/selector.js`; I fixed the comment now.",

      "How are you running the tests?\r\n\r\nYou need to build before running the tests as the build process creates a few test files and also builds jQuery and the built version is what gets tested by default. Run `npm run build` before running the tests.",

      "@mgol I don't remember, but below is what I can think of as being potentially of use:\r\n\r\n* the unlink means the file won't linger as untracked in the working directory after a test run is done.\r\n* the unlink affects the HTTP status code for requests that are before it is created or after it is emptied (HTTP 404 instead of HTTP 200). Having said that, the JS version never incorporated it, it just returns HTTP 200 always with an empty or non-empty string as response. So presumably our tests are never making the requests too early or too late and not relying on this behaviour?\r\n* the unlink ensures that each test run starts the same way (the file not existing), instead of it being 404 the first test run, but then starting as empty 200 OK the second time.\r\n* the unlink ensures that if something went out of control, or if the writing code uses \"append\" mode to put content, that it will still start empty instead of growing uncontrolled over time. But.. the empty string overwrite ensures that already.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense to me why the server would have permission to write the file but not delete it. But, if this helps, then I don't think it's worth further investigating. The only thing I'd recommend is to add it to `gitignore` (unless it is covered already?) to keep the file out of git-status during development since it's not meant to be committed and wouldn't benefit from a dirty signal there.\r\n\r\n",
      "@Krinkle the file is actually tracked & in the repo as empty. Which makes me think this `unlink` never really worked as otherwise finishing a test run with it would create a dirty repository state.\r\n\r\nPlus, our tests actually do depend on it existing. That’s why migrating to nginx locally broke some tests for me: some requests for `csp.log` started returning a 404 instead of 200.\r\n\r\nI can make the file untracked but then I have to make sure it exists pretty early somehow."

We wouldn't include input data in the thrown error anymore.\r\n\r\n+10 bytes, although I cheated a bit - I also removed an assignment of `xml` to `undefined` in `catch` as any error would happen before the assignment so the variable would already hold the `undefined` value. Without this optimization, it'd be +13 bytes.\r\n\r\nThat +10 can be changed to -3 if we just call:\r\n```js\r\njQuery.error( parserErrorElem && parserErrorElem.textContent )\r\n```\r\nbut that has two issues. Here's the returned element `parsererror` (after pretty-printing) in Blink & WebKit:\r\n```xml\r\n<parsererror\r\n\txmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\r\n\tstyle=\"display: block; white-space: pre; border: 2px solid #c77; padding: 0 1em 0 1em; margin: 1em; background-color: #fdd; color: black\">\r\n\t<h3>This page contains the following errors:</h3>\r\n\t<div style=\"font-family:monospace;font-size:12px\">error on line 14 at column 9: Opening and ending tag mismatch: th line 0 and tr\r\n</div>\r\n\t<h3>Below is a rendering of the page up to the first error.</h3>\r\n</parsererror>\r\n```\r\nand here's the one in Gecko:\r\n```xml\r\n<parsererror xmlns=\"http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/xml/parsererror.xml\">\r\n\tXML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected: &lt;/th&gt;.\r\nLocation: http://sandbox.l/test.xhtml\r\nLine Number 14, Column 6:\r\n\t<sourcetext>\t\t\t&lt;/tr&gt;\\n--------------------------^</sourcetext>\r\n</parsererror>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we just print `textContent`, in Chrome the text will miss spaces in some places:\r\n```\r\nThis page contains the following errors:error on line 14 at column 9: Opening and ending tag mismatch: th line 0 and tr\r\nBelow is a rendering of the page up to the first error.\r\n```\r\nThat may not be enough a reason to add bytes but here's what ends up in Firefox:\r\n```\r\nXML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected: </th>.\r\nLocation: http://sandbox.l/test.xhtml\r\nLine Number 14, Column 6:\t\t\t</tr>\r\n--------------------------^\r\n```\r\nFirefox prints ASCII art which is misaligned now. With the code from this PR, here's what gets printed:\r\n```\r\nXML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected: </th>.\r\nLocation: http://sandbox.l/test.html\r\nLine Number 14, Column 6:\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n--------------------------^\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it actually uses tabs to pad `</tr>` and the alignment depends on tab being rendered as 8 characters... So maybe we can give up on that.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Actually, this will mostly be printed in the DevTools of the respective browser, here: Firefox. So it should show up correctly in the console.\r\n\r\nLet's make a decision at the next meeting.\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [x] All authors have signed the CLA at https://cla.js.foundation/jquery/jquery\r\n* [x] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\r\n* [x] Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes\r\n* ~~If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com~~\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

We don't control the browser's reporting of XML errors so we can't ensure it will show any specific error message. What do you think? In either case it is an improvement!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure either way. Judging by the messages I cited in the PR description, the Chrome error kind of misses the context so the `Invalid XML: ` prefix would help. If we don't include user data in the error, though, in IE the message just ends like that with nothing appearing after the colon. Should we preserve that for IE? @timmywil was against but I don't see the risk - we're sure `data` is a string at this point and throwing an error is safe with any provided string.",

    "body": "\r\n\r\n\r\n> ### Summary ###\r\nJQMigrate generates a warning in some circumstances when using effects .fadeTo method, as it provides a numeric value to the .css method internally.  Since the recommendation is to always provide the string representation of the value, that should be done for internal functions as well as when being called externally.\r\n\r\nNo unit test updates should be needed, as existing fadeTo unit tests should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n> JQMIGRATE: Use of number-typed values is deprecated in jQuery.fn.css\r\n> Cause: In past versions, when a number-typed value was passed to .css() jQuery converted it to a string and added \"px\" to the end. As the CSS standard has evolved, an increasingly large set of CSS properties now accept values that are unitless numbers, where this behavior is incorrect. It has become impractical to manage these exceptions in the jQuery.cssNumber object. In addition, some CSS properties like line-height can accept both a bare number 2 or a pixel value 2px. jQuery cannot know the correct way to interpret $.css(\"line-height\", 2) and currently treats it as \"2px\".\r\n> \r\n> Solution: Always pass string values to .css(), and explicitly add units where required. For example, use $.css(\"line-height\", \"2\") to specify 200% of the current line height or $.css(\"line-height\", \"2px\") to specify pixels. When the numeric value is in a variable, ensure the value is converted to string, e.g. $.css(\"line-height\", String(height)) and $.css(\"line-height\", height+\"px\").\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [x] All authors have signed the CLA at https://cla.js.foundation/jquery/jquery\r\n* [ ] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works \r\n* [x] Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes\r\n* [ ] If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

      "Thanks @dmethvin - certainly worth reviewing this one carefully.\r\n\r\nAlong with one or two other reading references, there's a link to [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) in the linked issue #4707, and as far as I can tell from that, this should be valid.  Valid is necessary but not sufficient for being acceptable, however :)\r\n\r\nAlthough many use cases will indeed be using serialization of data from input fields, I'm considering scenarios where an application may want to serialize a JavaScript datastructure (potentially containing nulls) in an unambiguous and/or abbreviated form.\r\n\r\nThis brings to mind that I should add test coverage on recursive & nested object cases, so I'll look into that soon.",
      "@jayaddison I don't see anything in the linked RFC section that would justify this change, could you provide more details?",
      "@mgol Thanks for taking a look.  Yes indeed, nothing in the RFC itself suggests this functionality; it's a proposal that I'm making based on a desire to reliably serialize and subsequently deserialize objects containing null values from a JavaScript application.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is challenging because there is no robust way to distinguish between an empty string and a null value during serialization operations -- the objects `{a: ''}` and `{a: null}` end up serializing to the same data on-disk/on-the-wire.\r\n\r\nThese are generally treated as distinct conditions in JavaScript and in many database applications - and my suggestion is that we could safely and backwards-compatibly introduce this measure in order to allow unambiguous data representation for nulls.\r\n\r\nI've added some test coverage in b20a747c3ea4152b0a46c945146a4e370fab75d3 to illustrate the collision problem (and to verify the fix).",

      "Thanks for the pull request!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this improvement is not correct. The main reason why we no longer use `String.prototype.trim` internally is that it recognizes [more whitespace](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-WhiteSpace) than the [selectors spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#whitespace). For example, the following will find 0 elements (`00A0` is a code point for \"non-breaking space\"):\r\n```js\r\ndocument.querySelectorAll('body\\u{00A0}')\r\n```\r\nwhile the following will match one - the document body:\r\n```js\r\ndocument.querySelectorAll('body\\u{00A0}'.trim())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we remove `jQuery.trim` from Core, we'll also remove the `trim.js` file as it's only used there.",
      "Also, measuring performance in micro-benchmarks like the one you linked to is tricky; code like the one you shared is quite likely to be optimized by the browser to no code at all as soon as it notices it produces no side effects.",

See this link for more info:\r\nhttps://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/#never-commit-on-master\r\n\r\nThis is for the future sake only, let's keep this PR as it is as you can't change the source branch when the PR is open.",
      "@gaohuia You can see that jQuery Slim tests failed on your PR (see the Travis link). Your unit test should be moved to `unit/ajax.js` where tests related to the ajax module should lie. Then that test will be excluded for the Slim build & it should pass again.\r\n\r\nAlso, remember about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4563#discussion_r364368782 - we still need to get the tests to succeed in IE, Edge & Safari.",
      "Hi @mgol I didn't see any failed tests in safari 13, can you try again?",
      "@gaohuia Yes, Safari 13 is still failing. Note that Travis only runs tests on Chrome & Firefox, you need to test on the other browsers manually.\r\n\r\nSee e.g. Safari 13:\r\n<img width=\"866\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-17 at 23 03 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1758366/72649653-89df5980-397e-11ea-9a56-9458c73b360d.png\">\r\nand Edge 18:\r\n<img width=\"931\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-17 at 23 09 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1758366/72649663-906dd100-397e-11ea-9018-fc679f6a9120.png\">\r\n",
      "Hmm, the above test results were achieved in our PHP setup, the one that runs on our TestSwarm as well: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery\r\n\r\nWhen I run it on the Karma setup, by running `grunt karma:chrome-debug`, opening http://localhost:9876 in Safari & clicking \"DEBUG\", all tests pass.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Chrome & Firefox tests pass in both modes.",
      "I figured out the issue. Karma runs on `http://localhost:9876` so a replacement of `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` worked fine there. However, on my local PHP setup I'm relying on virtual hosts so the page runs on `http://jquery.l` so the replacement failed and the loaded script was, in effect, using the same domain. Apparently, in Chrome & Firefox that works but Safari 13 & Edge 18 just don't execute the script.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we cannot rely on the URL where the tests are loaded to be `localhost`. On our TestSwarm, for example, tests are loaded via URLs like:\r\nhttp://builds.jenkins.jquery.com/jquery/ff2819911da6cbbed5ee42c35d695240f06e65e3/test/index.html\r\nReplacing it via an IP won't work.\r\n\r\n~~We need to remove the replacement of `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` from the test.~~ (This part is out of date, see my later comments) The mere inclusion of the `crossorigin` attribute makes the script loaded with the `Origin` header so the current test checking whether `corsCallback` was invoked with `true` would fail without current source changes; that may serve as some kind of a check. Unfortunately, if we cut out the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` & `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` the test still passes; I'm not sure if there's a way around that, though, unfortunately.",
      "Thanks, I learnt a lot in this PR. ",
      "Regarding Firefox, if you request a script with `crossorigin=\"anonymous\"` but do not provide a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`header, the script will not be executed, on purpose.",
      "@mgol Can you help to review it?",
      "@mgol can you tell me how to run the karma tests with the real mock.php (I mean run it with php)? I added the same logic to \"mock.php\", but just not sure if it works fine.",
      "@gaohuia PHP tests are not run via Karma. To have all tests passing, you need to have Apache or nginx configured with PHP and open `/test/?hidepassed` in a browser, tests will run.\r\n\r\nIf this is too much, you can run a quick static PHP server in the jQuery directory:\r\n```\r\nphp -S 0.0.0.0:7001\r\n```\r\nand then open http://localhost:7001/test/?hidepassed. Note that with this basic setup some tests will fail as PHP can only handle one request at a time and some tests depend on being able to run requests in parallel. But it might be enough for your purposes.",

      "This PR now adds 89 bytes to the minified (non-gzipped) build & 5 bytes to the minified gzipped build. The gzipped difference mostly comes from the addition of the `./core/parseHTML.js` import to `jquery.js`, without it it added 36 bytes to minified (non-gzipped) and actually reduced (!) the minified gzipped build by 10 bytes. This is only a result of re-shuffling the final file, apparently Uglify was compiling the previous one better.\r\n\r\nI'm OK with such a delta given the gains from using the modern module format & removing our brittle compile process hacks as it's now mostly relying on Rollup but maybe it's possible to optimize it a little.",
      "OK, apparently we can go back to -10 bytes minified gzipped (& minimal unminified diff from the current Git compilation) if we move the `./core/parseHTML.js` from directly after the `./core.js` import to just before the `./ajax/load.js` one.",

      "I merged the PR to both `master` & `3.x-stable` and, unfortunately, only afterwards I noticed:\r\n1. This doesn't error but only print warnings; those warnings are silenced by `grunt eslint` and they get only printed if you run `node_modules/.bin/eslint .` directly.\r\n1. there's one `eslint-disable` comment that is legitimate but we still want to keep it - it's above the [`version` definition](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/46f9810b73a7ad446d7c3711faf92f56b67df3c1/src/core.js#L18-L19) because in some custom compilations that string may get large and we validate the build jQuery file with ESLint as well.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to proceed here due to the above.

      "@dmethvin Their reasoning sounds reasonable. We could work with it only if we pinned our ESLint version so that patch updates don't make our build fail. Currently we have it pinned via `package-lock.json` but I'd rather have it explicit in the `package.json` if possible.\r\n\r\n@edg2s I'd go for the first option; way smaller complexity. This doesn't resolve the issue that `grunt eslint` doesn't print the warnings but we can leave that for a separate PR.",

      "As discussed at the meeting today, I'll merge it soon (tomorrow or on Wednesday) unless someone wants to have a look.\r\n\r\nSome final remarks/questions from me (you can review them instead if you want):\r\n1. I updated `selector-native` slightly so that it passes some backported tests it used to fail - some Sizzle logic wasn't backported there.\r\n1. Re `test/unit/extending.js`: it contains tests for custom pseudos which we'll soon drop so I haven't backported it\r\n1. Re `test/unit/utilities.js`: it tests a few APIs that we already have tets for on the jQuery side; it also contains tests for `Sizzle.attr`, though. I assume they're not needed as jQuery attr tests should be enough.\r\n1. Tests using `Sizzle.matchesSelector` have been migrated by replacing `Sizzle.matchesSelector(selector, elem)` by `jQuery(elem).is(selector)`. `Sizzle.matches` tests weren't backported as it's a private API that no code in jQuery or Sizzle uses.\r\n1. Lots of tests using Sizzle have been migrated to use `jQuery.find` - should we document that method? If not, should we migrate those tests to use `jQuery`? Some queries need to be modified then. jQuery.find accepts as many as four parameters; do we want to support them all? Some tests are using all of them right now.\r\n1. Safari has surprisingly good support for CSS selectors that other browsers don't support. E.g. `:not(complex selector)` works in Safari. Therefore, I UA-sniff in tests & run some tests just in Safari OR if Sizzle is present (by checking for `jQuery.find.compile` as existing tests do)."

      "@jquery/core During my work on #4406, I've reminded myself we support many more custom selectors than just the ones listed in the 3.4.0 blog post as deprecated. We listed: `:first`, `:last`, `:eq`, `:even`, `:odd`, `:lt`, `:gt`, and `:nth` but we also support non-standard (linked to their API pages):\r\n- [`:contains`](https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/) - no easy replacement?\r\n- [`[attr!=\"value\"]`](https://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/) - can be replaced by users to `:not([attr=\"value\"])`\r\n- [`:selected`](https://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/) - can be replaced with `:checked` which natively supports selected options\r\n- [`:input`](https://api.jquery.com/input-selector/) - no easy replacement other than listing all the matching elements?\r\nand probably others, these are just the ones I had to deal with so far.\r\n\r\nWhat do we plan to do with those selectors?

      "Some of this can be handled by Migrate, or at least the easy cases of them. I wonder if we want *any* of custom selectors in 4.0 or should just have new custom methods by similar names where needed?\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have *very clear* instructions on how to convert from old to new, even if it means making new core methods to simplify things. So `$(\"div:contains(h1) > p\")` is hard to rewrite unless we create a new method so it would be possible to say `$(\"div\").contains(\"h1\").children(\"p\")`.\r\n\r\n",
      "> I wonder if we want _any_ of custom selectors in 4.0 or should just have new custom methods by similar names where needed?\r\n\r\n(porting some info from the Gitter discussion) We still need to maintain our own custom parsing just to reliably apply the ID hack to have a correct scoping mechanism.

      "It turns out my workaround for Chrome with `documentMode` emulation failing the \"SVG dimensions (border-box)\" test was incorrect; IE doesn't support `offset*` properties on SVGs either. The workaround really depends on IE incorrectly reporting content-box dimensions for `border-box` elements. I reverted this change (we're down to `-415` bytes), you can see the failure on Travis now.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways we can work around this:\r\n1. We accept that in this case we depend on the bug existing in IE and on it not getting fixed there. That means the special \"Chrome with `documentMode` emulation\" test run doesn't make sense anymore.\r\n2. We restore the `boxSizingReliable` test but guard it in the additional `documentMode` check to avoid triggering layout outside of IE. This will reduce size gains from `-415` bytes to `-201` bytes, although I suspect this can be reduced by removing some now redundant CSS from the support test.\r\n\r\nNote that in the past we've been bitten by an assumption that IE won't fix a bug when IE had a bug with dimensions in fullscreen mode inside iframes (see #1764) and we applied a workaround that multiplied the dimensions by 100 based on the `documentMode` check which we had to revert later (see #3041) when IE fixed it contrary to earlier claims. The probability of IE fixing something now is perhaps lower than 3 years ago, especially when it comes to something more complex than this simple iframe sizing bug but there's still some risk.",
      "I prefer the first option. It seems like the \"fullscreen in iframes\" bug was trivial to fix but something tells me that IE11 isn't going to fix its unreliable box sizing ever. If that seems like too much risk we could just guard it with `documentMode` to avoid forcing layout anywhere but IE. The sad thing about that solution is that IE11 will probably suffer the most performance hit from forcing layout.",
      "I also prefer the first option. As I mentioned in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4386#issuecomment-489331660 , if anyone ever _does_ release an update or fork of IE that fixes the issue, we can re-add support tests then.",

      "@mgol Disallowing unused earlier parameters I'm not sure is a good convention for code quality on its own merit.\r\n\r\nI do agree it makes a lot of sense here for jquery wrt AMD closures and such. But for other projects, I think the regular ESLint detection is enough. It seems like that would only adds extra overhead and maintenance cost over time (as well as potential confusion for new developers), without offering any real benefit, right?",
      "@Krinkle It depends. Where function parameters are not flexible, it doesn't do much besides force you to prefix the parameter name with underscore. But it does help clean up function signatures wherever they are flexible enough to be changed and the unused parameter can be removed. But I see your point that jQuery gets the most value from auditing the parameters for AMD loading and building.",
      "@Krinkle jQuery's AMD is the biggest beneficent of this new rule but we'll most likely migrate to ES modules so it will stop being so in the future. I see other gains, though - while, as @timmywil noted, functions bound by external contracts need the `_` prefixes, there are lots of internal ones and it's sometimes easy to miss a particular parameter may no longer be used & can be removed.\r\n\r\nIn my PR I only had to add the `_` prefix in 15 places, 8 of which are `jQuery.each` & 1 `jQuery.map`, leaving 6 \"regular\" cases.\r\n\r\nIf you think this rule is not a good fit for QUnit, I may just leave an override here but we haven't been using overrides so far. I see [QUnit is](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/blob/master/.eslintrc.json), though, and quite a lot at that; QUnit also uses the `eslint:recommended` config which we don't. I wonder how big a gain for QUnit is that it uses the `jquery` config; in the past we thought of it as a preset common for all jQuery Foundation projects but that hasn't materialized. At the moment, I think, it's mostly a few jQuery projects to which similar people contribute: Core, Migrate, Color, and QUnit.\r\n",
      "@mgol Yeah, makes sense to share with e.g. jquery migrate. Using the preset for that makes sense.\r\n\r\nI'd say don't worry about QUnit in that case, we can disable things as needed, no problem.\r\n\r\nOff-topic for here, but it might make sense to expose two presets within the `eslint-config-jquery` package. One for style and for static analysis/quality. Then projects could adopt one without the other, for example. We have a similar setup for Wikimedia at <https://github.com/wikimedia/eslint-config-wikimedia>, which has worked well for us.",

      "~~-540~~ ~~-577~~ ~~-867~~ -856 bytes.\r\n\r\nI recommend reviewing with whitespace changes ignored (e.g. via [adding `?w=1` to the URL](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4347/files?w=1)) to see real changes in `xhr.js` that got de-indented.\r\n\r\nA few open questions:\r\n1. I removed `support.cors` & `support.ajax` - are we OK with always assuming they're true? I'm not sure if IE 11 allows to disable native XHR as earlier IE did or if we still want to cater to those scenarios (we don't support the ActiveX versions anyway).\r\n1. In a few places (e.g. `src/data/Data.js`) we don't delete stuff from DOM nodes, instead setting them to `undefined`. It's supposedly to help with DOM performance in Blink/WebKit; the ticket referenced there is not available to the public, though. Do we know if this is still true and if it maybe applies to Gecko as well or not? I'd tweak the comment then.\r\n1. ~~`wrapMap.js` references IE 9 directly in two places. Most of the file is covered by the comment the wrapping is needed when used in XHTML; is that not true for `option` as well? We should either move `option` handling to be under the same XHTML-related comment, remove it or update the support comment if it's still needed for IE 11.~~ Update: this code has been removed from the PR.\r\n1. ~~`curCSS.js` references that `elem.style` is retrieved before the computed style as it fixes some issue in Firefox where it gets wrong values on detached elements. I couldn't find any relevant test or any more details about the supposed issue, could you help, @timmywil, as you committed the change?~~ This has been removed as the workaround that needed it is gone (it was neeeded for iOS 10 only).",
      "BTW, dropping support for iOS 10 & Firefox 60 (which we'll most likely do before the 4.0 release as we'll drop them around September/October) will cause a further reduction by -272 bytes, getting us to -812 bytes compared to `master` and only `+14` bytes compared to latest `2.2.x`. Here are relevant changes on top of this PR: https://github.com/mgol/jquery/commit/724f9558fe41dcd129ea09ff1b562a0479d8436c.",
      "I ran tests locally on this PR on most of the supported browsers:\r\n<img width=\"1190\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-10 at 16 48 18\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1758366/55888914-811c5480-5bb0-11e9-99bf-b9bb4c30f17b.png\">\r\n",
      "Per the discussion at the today's meeting, I changed the format of IE support comments from:\r\n```js\r\n// Support: IE <=9 - 11 only\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```js\r\n// Support: IE <=9 - 11+\r\n```\r\n",
      "I added one more commit removing IE 9-related code from `wrapMap.js` - I run some manual tests in XHTML mode and it didn't seem to cause any changes. The original wrapping of `<option>` in `<select>` was added in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/14b09024cbe39bc16200448170ccbd183e3a9ec2 (12.5 years ago!), it was changed to be wrapped in `<select multiple>` in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/264ffbc73be61778484a292392d1b18a8976588f. Removing that wrapping does make more tests fail in IE 9 but IE 11 still passes all the tests.\r\n\r\nThis removal saved additional `33` bytes. 🍾 ",
      "@jquery/core I've been thinking that maybe we should just drop Firefox 60 & iOS 10 in this PR as well. We'll do that anyway in October and it's not very likely we'll release 4.0 before that date. Especially dropping iOS 10 would give us a lot - it has a partially broken module support, early versions had partially broken Shadow DOM support, etc. Dropping it would help not only with library size but also it'd be easier to do all the upcoming major changes like the event system refactor, getting rid of Sizzle etc. if we didn't have to care about iOS 10 and breaking any of current workarounds targeted at it.\r\n\r\nIf, by any chance, we manage to land all those major changes, release an alpha/beta & then stable before we'd normally drop Firefox 60/iOS 10 (not very likely, IMO), we can always update the browser support page for jQuery 4.0 to state explicitly we don't support those browsers. We could later remove that note once they'd be out of our supported browser range anyway.\r\n\r\nI already have relevant changes ready at https://github.com/mgol/jquery/commit/724f9558fe41dcd129ea09ff1b562a0479d8436c, I could just merge it to this PR.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
      "I agree on the timeline, it seems likely that 4.0.0 could wait for those older browsers to drop below the threshold where we'd need to support them. It definitely cleans up some things!",
      "I added a commit dropping Firefox 60 & iOS 10. We can drop it if others disagree with me, @dmethvin & @jbedard but I think it makes sense to do it now.\r\n\r\nWe're down to `-867` bytes!"

Therefore, it seems the focusing order is:\r\n1. focusin\r\n1. focus\r\n1. focusin\r\n\r\nwhile the blurring one is:\r\n1. focusout\r\n1. blur\r\n\r\nTherefore, the order is not native; it's closer to the existing jQuery one but it has one additional second `focusin` that fails the test. We should look into that before merging IMO as that looks buggy.",
      "The second `focusin` is invoked via `this[ type ]()` in `leverageNative`. While the `event.stopImmediatePropagation()` is called, for a `focus` event that won't prevent `focusin` from propagating.\r\n\r\nAn additional complication are the `focusin`/`focusout` shims. While `focus` delegates to `focusin` & `blur` to `focusout`, in non-IE browsers `focusin` is implemented via `focus` in capture mode and `focusin` via `blur` in capture mode. But even if this shim is disabled the double-`focusin` issue still exists in the PR currently.",
      "I rebased the PR & restored the `focusin`/`focusout` test with one modification: `focusin` handlers are allowed to fire more than once.",
      "The current version of the PR passes tests when run via Karma or by opening `/test/?module=event` manually but fails when run via TestSwarm. It's not a case of different browser settings as I checked that all on my local TestSwarm install with the same Chrome & Safari browsers. The error happens in the `originalEvent type of simulated event` event test:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'event.originalEvent.type')\r\nin http://jquery.l//test/unit/event.js on line 2900\r\n```\r\nIt happens in Chrome & Safari, it doesn't happen in Firefox/Edge/IE.

      "> How would you feel about the approach from #4102 (comment) ?\r\n\r\nThe issue also applies to `textarea`, so limiting to table elements doesn't fix all issues. Also, I prefer a solution that doesn't require checking `nodeName`. Even though some table elements are given special consideration in the spec as offset parents, the solution still feels like it's in the same realm as browser sniffing.\r\n\r\nWe talked about `|| val === elem.style[ dimension ]` in the meeting. I see it as an enigmatic artifact from old code. It happens to work for a lot of cases, but has no real relation to what we want. What it's doing is checking if the computed value happens to be the same as the inline style and deciding that the value can be treated as border-box because it *probably* doesn't matter, but we've discovered here that's a risky assumption. Patching it up to include the table case (or the case where both values are zero) isn't really solving the problem as there could be more cases to cover that we haven't thought of yet. It's just adding band-aids to an already confusing line of code that doesn't have any logical bearing on whether a value is border-box. I'd much prefer something more explicit. I know that's difficult to accomplish given IE's *loose* relationship with computed border-box, but this is an attempt at addressing the real behavior in IE 9-11 and documenting that behavior with comments.",

Sure, I can just change the script to `<script src=\"//unpkg.com/jquery@3/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>`.

But even if we don't land this, this PR shows in which direction to look for the real issue.\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [x] All authors have signed the CLA at https://cla.js.foundation/jquery/jquery\r\n* ~~New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works~~\r\n* [x] Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes\r\n* ~~If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com~~\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

While <base href> fixes native expansion (e.g. in HTML attributes,\r\n       in CSS, and when passed to XHR), it did affect in-JS expansion in\r\n       our tests, which use hacks based on location.href (e.g. for <a>\r\n       property tests in unit/basic.js, and creation of absolute urls\r\n       by unit/ajax.js).\r\n       Fix those by introducing a prependUrlBase() function that prepends\r\n       document.baseURI instead of location.href\r\n    2. A test in unit/manipulation.js clicks on an anchor link. This broke\r\n       the test entirely by navigating away from the test page since href=\"#2\"\r\n       would now expand to /base/test/#2.\r\n       Fix those by:\r\n       - Remove the <base> tag again.\r\n       - Revert the logic in prependUrlBase() to how it used to be inlined.\r\n       - Remove prependUrlBase() from basic/attributes test.\r\n       - Instead, fix url() to have baseURL be \"/base/test/\" when in Karma.\r\n       - Apply url() to bare urls:\r\n         - unit/core.js (globalEval test)\r\n         - unit/support.js (csp test)\r\n\r\n* In addition to all the above, the most time-consuming part still was making\r\n  the Ajax tests pass because they currently assume being served from\r\n  Apache with mod_php installed.\r\n  I originally planned on addressing this by starting another Node server\r\n  before Karma starts, somehow injecting its url, and stopping it after Karma.\r\n  Instead, let's try to use Karma's support for middleware to (hopefully)\r\n  make this prettier.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #1999.",

I [opened a ticket](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/2198) on uglify-js, as I didn't think this transformation should occur unless `unsafe` is set to `true`. The resolution turned out better than I expected. Uglify added a new `compress` option: `typeofs` that disables only this transformation.

    "body": "rAF logic was introduced almost three years ago relative to this commit,\r\nas a primary method for scheduling animation (see gh-1578 pull).\r\n\r\nWith it there was two substantial changes - one was explicitly mentioned\r\nand the other was not.\r\n\r\nFirst, if browser window was hidden aka `document.hidden === true`\r\nit would immediately execute all scheduled animation without waiting\r\nfor time pass i.e. tick time become `0` instead of 13 ms of a default value.\r\n\r\nWhich created possibility for circular executions in case if `complete`\r\nmethod executed the same animation (see gh-3434 issue).\r\n\r\nAnd the second one - since then there was two ways of scheduling animation:\r\nwith `setInterval` and `requestAnimationFrame`, but there was a\r\ndifference in their execution.\r\n\r\nIn case of `setInterval` it waited default `jQuery.fx.interval` value before\r\nactually starting the new tick, not counting the first step which wasn't\r\nset to be executed through tick method (aka `jQuery.fx.tick`).\r\n\r\nWhereas `requestAnimationFrame` first scheduled the call and executed\r\nthe `step` method right after that, counting the first call of\r\n`jQuery.fx.timer`, `tick` was happening twice in one frame.\r\n\r\nBut since tests explicitly disabled rAF method i.e.\r\n`requestAnimationFrame = null` and checking only `setInterval` logic,\r\nsince it's impossible to do it otherwise - we missed that change.\r\n\r\nFaulty logic also was presented with `cancelAnimationFrame`, which couldn't\r\nclear any timers since `raf` scheduler didn't define new `timerId` value.\r\n\r\nBecause that change was so subtle, apparently no user noticed it proving\r\nthat both `cancelAnimationFrame` and `clearInterval` code paths are redundant.\r\n\r\nSince `cancelAnimationFrame` didn't work properly and rAF is and was a primary\r\nused code path, plus the same approach is used in other popular animation libs.\r\n\r\nTherefore those code paths were removed.\r\n\r\nThese changes also replace two different functions which schedule the animation\r\nwith one, which checks what type of logic should be used and executes it\r\nappropriatley, but for secondary path it now uses `setTimeout` making it more\r\nconsistent with rAF path.\r\n\r\nSince ticks are happening globally we also don't require to listen\r\n`visibilitychange` event.\r\n\r\nIt also changes the way how first call is scheduled so execution of\r\nanimation will not happen twice in one frame.\r\n\r\nNo new tests were not introduced, since now `setTimeout` logic should be\r\nequivalent to the rAF one, but one test was changed since now we actually\r\nexecute animation at the first tick.\r\n\r\nFixes gh-3434\r\n\r\n### Summary ###\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe what this PR does.

At some point that's the way uglify generated them but now the \"file\" field is at the very end. The solution is simple, make the changes with two separate regexp passes.\n\nTesting this _in situ_ with a jquery-release run is super painful because of the safety checks that go on before we get to the CDN creation which is at the tail end of the whole long complicated process, but I tested the regexp replace with this script:\n\n``` js\nvar fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nvar unpathedFile = \"jquery-3.1.0.min.map\";\nvar text;\n\ntext = fs.readFileSync( unpathedFile, \"utf8\" )\n    .replace( /\"file\":\"([^\"]+)\"/,\n        \"\\\"file\\\":\\\"\" + unpathedFile.replace( /\\.min\\.map/, \".min.js\" ) )\n    .replace( /\"sources\":\\[\"([^\"]+)\"\\]/,\n        \"\\\",\\\"sources\\\":[\\\"\" + unpathedFile.replace( /\\.min\\.map/, \".js\" ) + \"\\\"]\" );\n\nfs.writeFileSync( \"result.txt\", text );\n```\n### Checklist\n\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\n- [x] All authors have signed the CLA at https://contribute.jquery.com/CLA/\n- [ ] ~~New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works~~ (see above)\n- [x] Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes\n- [ ] ~~If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com~~\n\nThanks!

Both these packages have a race condition for the `commit-msg` git hook during `npm install` and husky is the first one to install its hook. So, commitplease complains about the presence of another git hook during install and does nothing. Later on it does not validate commit messages as it never gets triggered.\n\nThis PR bumps the version of commitplease to `2.4.0` and configures commitplease so that:\n1. It does not complain about the presence of husky hook during `npm install`\n2. It uses the husky hook and validates commit messages later on\n3. It prohibits the use of `Closes #123` and `Fixes #123` github-style ticket references that are written on a separate line (writing them in an ordinary sentence of a commit message is still possible)\n\nTo try it out, checkout this branch and do an `npm install` to pull the `2.4.0` version into your node_modules. When you get back to `master`, do not forget to `npm install` again to pull `2.3.1` version back.\n### Checklist\n\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\n- [x] All authors have signed the CLA at https://contribute.jquery.com/CLA/\n- [ ] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works\n- [x] Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes\n- [ ] If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com\n\nThanks!

This also removes the slow (even if no layout is forced) loop from `fix`.\n\nThe main problems with this approach:\n- getter properties are slow (but unless you call them N+ times still faster then today's `fix` loop, and fixes #1746)\n- ~~putting getter properties on the prototype means `event.hasOwnProperty(eventProp)` is false~~ (EDIT: this is actually what native events do, so this is probably a good thing)\n\nPotential changes to this approach:\n- drop the setter part (normally faster, except when the getter is called X+ times)\n- create `jQuery.MouseEvent` and `jQuery.KeyboardEvent` so properties like `shiftKey` are only on keyboard events\n- only use getters for properties which might force a layout and keep the fix-loop for copying other properties (requires new getter-properties API)\n",

If we want prefilters to see it this would have to be moved higher. However, the prefilters have the opportunity to change all kinds of stuff that might affect whether we do this at all. So I decided to do it a bit further down once the `hasContent` variable is set and the content-type is known. Other suggestions welcome.\n",

I can made my own test or we can use his since they are already made. If you decide to use his test, then probable it's better what he will commint them by himself.\n\nAlso @gibson042 said in #1784\n\n> I don't like this conflation of unrelated behaviors.\n\nAbout this line of code: `if ( !elem.createShadowRoot && !jQuery.contains( docElem, elem ) ) {`\nI agree with it, but this check is more performant than tree traversal or `try..catch` block. Also it's not so much unrelated, it's used to prevent use `jQuery.contains()` in situation when it does not work _and_, by the way, prevents IE8 to fail.\n",

    "body": "Hello, jQuery team!\n\nthoughtbot recently released Javascript linting for Hound, and I think it would be a good tool for this project. I saw that jQuery has a [JS style guide](https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/blob/master/pages/style-guide/js.md) for its projects – if you have to point out a lot of [style violations in pull requests](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/885#discussion-diff-1308308), I think it would be worth giving Hound a spin for a while. It's free for open source, and it's helped me out a lot in my projects.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Hound, it's a github integration that watches repos for pull requests and points out style guide violations in the PRs. There's some background on it here: http://robots.thoughtbot.com/hound-reviews-javascript-for-style-violations\n\nThis PR configures Hound to watch for violations based on your jsHint settings. To get Hound to watch this repo, an admin would also have to activate the repo at https://houndci.com/.\n\nSo you can get an idea of what Hound would look like, I've opened a pull request on my fork of jQuery with some style violations. You can check it out here: https://github.com/graysonwright/jquery/pull/1\n\nFor full disclosure, I work at thoughtbot, which makes Hound. We're trying to spread the word a bit by suggesting Hound to open-source projects where it would be a good fit. But you don't have to worry – we're big supporters of open source, and Hound will stay free for open source projects forever.\n\nEither way, thanks so much for jQuery – it's a great library and we use it every day. I hope Hound can make your jobs a little bit easier!\n\nCheers,\n-Grayson\n",

I have found this issue worse then the jQuery2 version because cleanData often runs on large groups of nodes at once (such as when changing pages in a SPA).  If every node (with data) reproduces the chrome issue it can cause memory usage to spike very high and cause significant performance issues. I have seen pages spike from 15m to 150m while transitioning pages in a SPA, combined with https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2073 that use case often crashes the browser.\n\nThe easiest way to reproduce it, in the chrome console (on any page, a blank one makes the memory snapshot easier to read):\n\n```\nvar div = document.createElement(\"div\");\ndiv.jQuery123 = 1;\n*heap snapshot #1*\ndelete div.jQuery123;\n*heap snapshot #2*\n```\n\nIf you find the detached div element in the heap snapshot it is about 150 bytes in snapshot 1, in snapshot 2 I'm normally seeing it around 6300 bytes.\n\nI'm having trouble testing this properly in oldIE so I'm not 100% sure if the current commit covers oldIE correctly. I think setting `elem[ $.expando ] = undefined` will just change the expando attribute to `jQuery###=\"undefined\"` in the DOM, so maybe we need a support test for that and an extra `.removeAttribute( internalKey )`?\n",

Instead it resets some of those variables, which causes the abort test in the other methods to erroneously pass and ultimately for callbacks to be added to and invoked by a disabled object.\n",

Some of previous closed tickets proposed to include a binary dataType, with adhoc changes on the transport function :\nhttp://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11461\nhttp://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9992\nhttp://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14068\n\nI think it is not appropriate as the response attribute deals with more than binary data, like arraybuffer, but extends to blob, document and json datatype. In my pull request, I create a native datatype to support all the four response types that are abstracted.\n\nI think also that such improvements should be included as this is a new improvement in XHR, that is not already included in jQuery. Also, trying to use a converter in the case of ArrayBuffer for example, leads to a heavy loop for the conversion (See: http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/06/How-to-convert-ArrayBuffer-to-and-from-String). Simple casting doesn't function.\n\nIn my case, I have used Brain dMRI NifTI data formats that are 20MB in size, and all of them need parsing after downloading, which is also a heavy computation (a hundred of milliseconds).\n\nAlso, treating a binary data as text, it is just not natural at all, as this is already the case.\n\nIn any way, I think we should find a solution, and this is my proposition. Please, take a look at the tests, for the usage. And let's start a discussion around this.\n",

You can see the issue here http://jsfiddle.net/4FxSt/.\n\n`fail` and `always` callbacks will not be called in the example below\n\n```\n//pulled from ticket\n$.get('//example.com:80q').then(function () {\n    console.log('not called'); \n}).fail(function () {\n    console.log('not called'); \n}).always(function () {\n    console.log('not called');\n});\n```\n\nThis appears because of the added onerror listener to xhr at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/xhr.js#L110\n\nBecause this successfully fires (in chrome and safari) when trying an invalid url the try catch at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L649 throws an error instead of calling done() when chrome triggers a networkerror. Unfortunately throwing this error prevents the deferred callback from being called.\n\nThis can be fixed by delaying throwing the error by adding a setTimeout around throw e.\n\nThe alternative fix for this issue would be to remove the `xhr.onerror` callback that is not consistently being called with all browsers or remove `throw e` line.\n",

Although current code tries to circumvent it, but fails on edge <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14189\">cases</a>.\n\nWith script injection we have four problems:\n1) It requires browser environments, i.e. DOM\n2) It might be executed <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7862\">asynchronously</a>\n3) Errors do not propagate, but instead would be thrown in different flow, meaning you can't catch them without `window.onerror`\n4) Potential performance penalty\n\nOne common and obvious issue is difference of `globalEval` functionality between branches.

    "body": "This is really more of a proof-of-concept and conversation starter than something to land.\n\nFollowing up on our discussion Monday, this uses the complexity measures from JSHint and sets default limits that just about all the code currently passes. For the exceptions I've wrapped them in jshint directives that turn off the warnings. There's also a max line length check, but when set to our style guide's recommended max of 100 it is quite noisy. :smile: \n\nPros:\n- The comments lay out where the hot spots are, so we can have a better idea of where to be careful and spend extra time in reviewing patches or refactoring.\n- Only the people who read the code need to be concerned with these comments, so they're not drawing a bunch of attention from people who'd naively recommend we rewrite them just to get better metrics.\n\nCons:\n- In jshint you can't restore a setting back to its original default or previous value. So if you want to avoid a warning you have to turn it off completely, then back on. That means subsequent editing in the complex areas may make things worse and nobody will notice it. What I want to do is bump the limit up around these just enough to avoid the warning.\n- There's some bug in JSHint where the warning in effects has to be in a much larger block of code to be effectve, rather than being tightly around the offending function (`defaultPrefilter`).\n\nI think the inability to push/pop temporary limits to specific metrics is a deal-killer for this idea. It might be worth looking into eslint, seems like it could potentially do the job of both JSHint and jscs.\n",

By updating this directly, we can avoid creating two new DOM nodes per text value update.\n\nThis removes a memory leak. :)\n\n(IE8 and lower continue to work as before.)\n\nNote: All tests are passing, but no tests were added. This is because JavaScript doesn't have access to DOM node counts. However, we can verify the value added fairly easily.\n\nStep 1: Learn how to record memory usage over time (10s or so), with Chrome Dev Tools.\nhttps://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/timeline#memory_mode\n\nStep 2: Contrast these two Fiddles. Pay attention to the climbing DOM Node Count in the second example.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ctZzF/1/ # new optimization\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ctZzF/2/ # current implementation\n\nAlso, it turns out Zepto is already using this optimization.

Both readme of these packages recommend to install them globally, but it does not mean they would not work if installed locally (actually, it would be strange if they would not work this way). \n\nAs jQuery developer you would still have an option to build jQuery with <code>bower</code> and <code>grunt</code> commands, but with this commit, you would not require to do so. It also simplifies build instructions and might help with dilemma of whether or not put bower components in the repository. \n",

    "body": "I'm not sure if this belongs in a pull request. I'm sending it out for discussion. Maybe it should just be a totally separate module.\n\nThe patch adds a `jQuery.when2` function. The code borrows heavily from `jQuery.when`. The main differences from `jQuery.when` are:\n- when2 must be called with a list as its first argument.\n- An options object may be passed as a second argument.\n- If `options.resolveOnFirstSuccess` is `true`, the deferred returned by when2 will be resolved as soon as any of the passed deferreds resolves. In this case, done callbacks will be passed `index`, `value` args, where `index` is the index of the deferred that fired. If non-deferreds are in the arguments to `when2`, the first one seen will trigger the resolve (not very useful, but consistent).\n- If `options.failOnFirstError` is `false`, the deferred returned by when2 will never fail. It will collect the results from all the deferreds and pass them all back. The caller gets to figure out which values (if any) are errors.\n- If no options are given (or `options.failOnFirstError` is `true`), `fail` will be called on the master deferred on the first error, as with `jQuery.when`. The args passed to `fail` will be `index` and `value`, to indicate which deferred was rejected.\n- Any `.progress` callbacks added to the `when2` returned deferred are also called with `index` and `value` so you can tell which deferred made progress.  Once the master deferred has fired, no further progress events are fired.\n- `when2` always makes a new deferred (instead of trying to re-use the single deferred it is given if it only has one argument). This makes the code simpler and was in any case necessary due to needing to pass index and value args to the callbacks in the single-argument case when `resolveOnFirstSuccess` or `failOnFirstError` indicate that just one deferred should trigger the master.\n- A slightly radical possible future thing to add would be to co-opt the `.progress` callback and use it to instead relay `resolve` info (each call having an index & a value to show which of the passed deferreds had resolved). A flag in `options` could request that behavior. It's a perversion but it's easy to think of ways in which that could be useful.\n- It might be possible to implement `jQuery.when` in terms of `jQuery.when2`. I tried that originally, but ran into difficulty so decided to leave it for later (or never).\n- It would be easy to add convenience functions like `jQuery.whenAnySuccess` or `jQuery.whenAllResolvedOrRejected` that just called `when2` with the correct option.\n\nThe aim here, obviously, is to provide more flexibility than `when` does. I don't like the name `when2` much, but I called it that for now (in the spirit of `dup2`). I'm sure my Javascript style wont match the jQuery style in some ways & am happy to fix that.  I copied some of the `jQuery.when` tests, but some were too complicated to get right for `when2` so I ended up adding a bunch of small tests as well.\n\nThanks for any help / discussion. I'm not expecting this to get merged anytime soon, or even at all. But I'd like to hear what people think.\n\nBTW, the approach mirrors what you can do with Twisted's DeferredList (see http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.defer.DeferredList.html), which gives you the same 3 behaviors: fire on first callback, fire on first errback, fire when everything is done (errors or not).\n",

    "body": "Did you notice test for #13937 being unstable (http://swarm.jquery.org/result/394435) in FF? That test sometimes fails, reporting that some animations are still running. Did you wander why?\n\nWhen <code>jQuery#finish</code> called, it creates new animation in order to lead all queued animations to end CSS values, those animations than gets removed from <code>jQuery.timers</code> array from <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L674\">jQuery.fx.tick</a> method, which is called every <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L705\">13ms</a>.\n\nQUnit method <code>start</code> (which is used in <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/effects.js#L2136\">#13937</a> test) uses <code>setTimeout</code> method in order to \"<a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/qunit/qunit.js#L468\">...avoid any current callbacks</a>\".\n\nSo basically it's look like this –\n\n``` js\nsetInterval(function() {\n    // clear jQuery.timers\n}, 13 );\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n    // check jQuery.timers\n    // and this is sometimes jQuery.timers.length === 1, which is wrong\n}, 13 )\n```\n\nThis is all happens because sometimes FF executes <code>setInterval</code> function later than <code>setTimeout</code> function, even if timeout that passed to <code>setTimeout</code> function is much bigger than the one that passed to <code>setInterval</code> function.\n\nIt always happens if tab that executes that code, is not in focus, but it sometimes happens even when tab in \"focus\". Which is illustrated in <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/D4FBA/show/\">this</a> example. Go to the page in FF, than immediately move focus to another tab, wait a bit, then go back and look at the console.\n\n/cc @gibson042\n",

Perf hit for <code>jQuery#append/prepend</code> methods applied to parentless element would be:\n<ul>\n<li><code>jQuery#append</code> – <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-append/4\">big</a>/<a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-append/5\">small</a> HTML-string</a></li>\n<li><code>jQuery#prepend</code> – <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-prepend/4\">big</a>/<a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-prepend/5\">small</a> HTML-string</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>HTML-string in IE9, could not be inserted to <code>table</code> element through <code>insertAdjacentHTML</code> method, plus in other browsers, that code path perform <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/iah-to-table\">worse</a> then current way. Perf hit for bypassing <code>table</code> element as target node would be – <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/iah-to-table/3\">http://jsperf.com/iah-to-table/3</a></li>\n\n<li>Sometimes HTML-string must be wrapped, like when creating <code>tr</code> element, in such case if <code>insertAdjacentHTML</code> is not applied to <code>table</code> element that code would silently <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/tQ4K2/\">fail</a>, therefore for that cases <code>iAH</code> path must not be taken, perf hit will be the same as for above <code>table</code> example</li>\n\n<li><code>iAH</code> could not take <code>object</code> as an argument. Perf hit by circumventing <code>object</code> as an argument would be – <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-append-object\">http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-append-object</a></li>\n\n<li><code>document fragment</code> (and all other types of an node) does not have <code>insertAdjacentHTML</code> method, also <code>script</code> element should not be inserted that way. Perf hit for that cases would be – http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-append-to-documentfragment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>As conclusion</h4>\n\nPerformance ratio of WebKit <code>iAH</code> in case of big HTML-string relative to current DOM-manipulation way is utterly depressing, one might even suggest that this happens due to regexp check, but it's not the <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/iah-append/5\">case</a> – in that version of a <code>iAH</code> implementation regexp check is removed, which does not heavily change the picture. Solution for that problem might be size check of HTML-string.\n\nUse of <code>jQuery#append</code> as an example of that idea – <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-append-limited-html\">big</a>/<a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jq-iah-append-limited-html/2\">small</a> HTML-string. This control is flatten disproportion in WebKit case, but it also decrease performance in other browsers.\n\nI suppose big HTML-string is rarely acts as argument in jQuery's DOM-manipulation methods, maybe only in case when whole page should be reflowed, besides, 184 operation per second might be fast enough for that task, ergo it might be more productive to dwell on more optimistic small HTML-string's cases, given the idea that if whether or not <code>iAH</code> should be employed was made only by proceeding outcome most of other samples then decision would be little more obvious? As of perf hit examples (see above) – some of them are rare edge cases, some of them do not matter that much and some of them aren't that conclusive.\n\nBut considering all that, i'd say this research is showed a lot of arguments to not use <code>iAH</code> inside of <code>jQuery#domManip</code> at all.\n",

Then came the idea of calling the conversion logic even for errors. That way, the `responseText` field would be set for errors for a cost of 0 bytes. Also, as an added bonus, this would set all `responseXXX` fields which the error body could/should be converted to.\n\nI remembered [#11151](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11151) and the fact that having ajax convert the error body is something I'm asked about/for at every single conference. So I added a `responseJSON` field and I made sure the `dataFilter` is never called in that situation (would have been a major backward incompatibility). Now, whenever you have an error body with a content-type corresponding to one or our dataType, the corresponding `responseXXX` field will be set (see [this unit test](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c0c38adc1e4a1e5567312132fec8dbf4b0f63e03/test/unit/ajax.js#L1425)).\n\nIn the end, this fixes a bug and adds a feature while staying backward compatible all this for a mere 16 bytes.\n\nAwaiting @gibson042's look to see if we can save more (it's the setting of `isSuccess` outside of the if condition that makes most of the size increase for reasons I don't really get :/).\n",

    "body": "Sugar (http://sugarjs.com/) adds methods to built-in prototypes.\n\nNow, I realize that sentence alone will likely elicit a strong reaction, especially within the jQuery team. However, Sugar makes an argument that there is a safe way to augment JS natives by being safe, conservative in approach, tons of testing, and a few fundamental differences to Prototype (most of this is detailed here http://sugarjs.com/native). Sugar takes a certain stance, but I do see valid points to both sides of the argument.\n\nHowever, I believe that the pull request I have submitted, lies _outside_ this argument. The crux of the issue is that jQuery is checking for the property `namespace` on an object that is assumed to be a `jQuery.Event` but in fact may also be a string. When making this assumption it should do a type check to ensure that the object is an instance of `jQuery.Event` before assuming the property `namespace` on it.\n\nI am anticipating a counterpoint that \"it is reasonable for libs to assume \"clean\" prototypes\" and I think there is a valid point to be made there. However I have my own counterpoints to that, and regardless this change can only serve to make jQuery more robust. Also I believe that if you are presuming a `namespace` property it is reasonable to assume it to be scoped to the object you have defined it on.\n\nI am probably going to remove this method from Sugar anyway, 1. as an emergency fix on the assumption that this pr will take a while to be released even if it is accepted and 2. because it never fit into the lib very well anyway.\n\nThank you!\n\nandrewplummer/Sugar/issues/265\n",

The other thing, which is a bit more important is add the enabling and unlocking of lists. I've created a backup object, which takes a backup of the list, stack and memory (stack and memory are only if applicable) before locking/disabling the callbacks so that they can be unlocked or enabled and restored to full functionality if so wished. Please bear in mind that this is my first jQuery commit so I'm sorry if I messed up something. Also, I didn't do any testing because I ran this through jshint so there's no syntax errors, and the code I changed doesn't affect the functionality of callbacks, so I didn't do any unit tests.

The call\n\n$('div').css('-webkit-column-count', 2);\n\n..would silently fail. After looking at the jQuery source, it looks like jQuery automatically appends 'px' to any number passed to the css function -unless- it is on a 'white-list' of values (opacity, zoom, ..). As a workaround, I was able to change the call to...\n\n$('div').css('-webkit-column-count', '2') , which succeeded.\n\nThis change simply adds 'column-count' (along with the prefixed versions) to the white-list. It's a small change, but will hopefully save others trouble in the future, thanks.\n\njsfiddle showing issue:  http://jsfiddle.net/DfhMW/\n",

So, parent element being null or document fragment in oldIE, seems logical to me.\n\nOthers patches more or less self-explanatory\n",

However, both `undefined > 0` and `undefined <= 0` are false :-|\n\nI did not include unit tests, however, because those would require us to be testing SVG and MathML, and is not something I'm interested in.

    "body": "This Pull Request relates to [http://jqbug.com/12266](http://jqbug.com/12266). The issue involved getting an exception when trying to create nested elements such as `$( \"<div><div></div></div>\" )`. The initial jsFiddle used to recreate the issue was using a 3rd party script that injected an `iframe`. After some trial and error I've found a way to recreate this issue reliably in IE9/10 with a reduced test case. It was difficult to recreate under normal circumstances, so I used the `testIframeWithCallback` function and made a `test/data/manipulation/iframe-denied.html` file to assist in the testing process.\n\nThe trick was to create an `iframe` with a cross-domain source before DOM Ready. The interesting thing about IE9/10 is that anytime you add an `iframe` or an object to the DOM it will alias it's `window` object onto the `document`. For example, after adding an iframe to the DOM you can access that `iframe's` `window` object off of `document[0]`. \n\n![IE9 Debugger](http://f.cl.ly/items/0017361H070910022G32/12266-ie9-debugger.png)\n\nYes, that is weird and that is why `buildFragment` was throwing an exception because it was trying to access `context[0]`, which was the `window` object from a cross-domain `iframe`.\n\nI testing this new Unit Test in IE6/7/8/9/10 before I applied the fix and it failed in IE9 & IE10 as expected. After applying the following fix the Unit Test passes in IE6/7/8/9/10 as well as all the other unit tests in the manipulation module.\n\n``` diff\njQuery.buildFragment = function( args, context, scripts ) {\n    var fragment, cacheable, cachehit,\n        first = args[ 0 ];\n\n        // Set context from what may come in as undefined or a jQuery collection or a node\n+       // Updated to fix #12266 where accessing context[0] could throw an exception in IE9/10 &\n+       // also doubles as fix for #8950 where plain objects caused createDocumentFragment exception\n        context = context || document;\n-       context = (context[0] || context).ownerDocument || context[0] || context;\n+       context = context instanceof jQuery ? context[0] : context;\n+       context = context.ownerDocument || context;\n\n-       // Ensure that an attr object doesn't incorrectly stand in as a document object\n-       // Chrome and Firefox seem to allow this to occur and will throw exception\n-       // Fixes #8950\n-       if ( typeof context.createDocumentFragment === \"undefined\" ) {\n-           context = document;\n-       }\n        ...\n};\n```\n\nThe above change also accounts for the bug fix that was made for #8950 where plain objects caused a createDocumentFragment exception. The above fix passes the unit test added for #8950 which is still present in the manipulation test module. Therefore, I removed the patch for #8950 since the above code accounts for that scenario as well.\n\nBy fixing the security concern related to this issue and removing the fix for #8950, which is no longer needed, it reduces the overall size of jQuery!\n\n``` text\nRunning \"compare_size:files\" (compare_size) task\nSizes - compared to master\n    258224       (-51)  dist/jquery.js                                         \n     92551       (-42)  dist/jquery.min.js                                     \n     33117        (-5)  dist/jquery.min.js.gz   \n```\n",

    "body": "# Clearing a Cloned Element's Style Causes the Original Element's Style to be Cleared\n## Introduction\n\nIn IE9 and IE10 you can run into the situation when clearing (`\"\"`) a cloned element's style will also clear out the original element's corresponding style.\n\nThe actual [jQuery Core Ticket #8908](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8908) isolates the bug when using the background-image style. \n\nWhile I was trying to recreate and research this issue I had a feeling that there may be other styles that have the same issue, so I've created a [test suite](https://gist.github.com/b12e402ab0c25b0c8b02) checking [252 CSS1-3 styles](http://meiert.com/en/indices/css-properties/) and testing various assertions. \n\nAlong the way, I also found some additional inconsistencies. These findings are technically unrelated to the #8908 issue so I will list those inconsistencies somewhere else and we can discuss those later.\n### Source Element's Style Cleared When Cloned Element's Style Cleared\n### IE9 & IE10\n\nAfter testing 252 various styles only the following 8 ended up being problematic.\n- background-attachment\n- background-color\n- background-image\n- background-position\n- background-repeat\n- background-clip\n- background-origin\n- background-size\n### IE 6/7/8, Chrome, Firefox, Opera\n\nThankfully these browsers did not have the problem described in this issue when tested.\n## Proposed Solutions\n### 1. Use Default Values when Trying to Empty Style\n\nThe following fix resolves the weird issue by substituting and empty string with it's default value. An object is used to store the style name and associated default value. If the value happens to be an empty string then it will look in the object for a matching key and if there is a match it will use that instead. \n\n``` diff\n// css.js\n+ // These styles were identified to be problems in IE9/10\n+ var defaultValue = {\n+     \"background-attachment\": \"scroll\",\n+     \"background-color\": \"transparent\",\n+     \"background-image\": \"none\",\n+     \"background-position\": \"0% 0%\",\n+     \"background-repeat\": \"repeat\",\n+     \"background-clip\": \"border-box\",\n+     \"background-origin\": \"padding-box\",\n+     \"background-size\": \"auto auto\"\n+ };\n\n+ value = ( value === \"\" && defaultValue[ name ] !== undefined ) ? defaultValue[ name ] : value;\n\ntry {\n    style[ name ] = value;\n} catch(e) {}\n```\n#### Pros\n- This is very explicit in describing which styles are problematic in IE\n#### Cons\n- There is extra code executed when clearing the style for a nonIE browser. This could be a problem because updating a style via the `.css()` method is very common\n- There is a considerable amount of code to account for all problematic styles and this will bloat the jQuery source\n### 2. Strange Side Effect That Breaks the Clone Connection\n\nThis solution is a little more strange and not so obvious. I ran into this fix as I was building up my unit tests and asserting a bunch of things I thought should be true. One of those assertions was verifying that when setting a style using the `$elem.css( \"someStyle\", \"someValue\" )` method that it actually worked. So, I used the getter (`$elem.css( \"someValue\" )` method, but by doing so I found the problem going away just by calling the getter! And with that the following solution came about.\n\nYou may notice a slightly strange piece of code `( window.getComputedStyle( elem, null ) || {} )`, but that was needed to get around an Opera bug I had when working with XML nodes. Technically I could have made the whole fix into one statement, but the minification process does a decent job of squishing down the fix to look like `(b.nodeType===1&&a.getComputedStyle&&(i=(a.getComputedStyle(b,null)||{}).backgroundImage)`.   \n\n``` diff\n// clone.js\njQuery.extend({\n    clone: function( elem, dataAndEvents, deepDataAndEvents ) {\n        var srcElements,\n            destElements,\n            i,\n-           clone;\n+           clone,\n+           fix8908;\n\n        if ( jQuery.support.html5Clone || jQuery.isXMLDoc(elem) || !rnoshimcache.test( \"<\" + elem.nodeName + \">\" ) ) {\n+           // Fixes #8909 - By accessing one of the element's computed styles it breaks the\n+           // connection with the cloned element's styles in IE9/10\n+           if ( elem.nodeType === 1 && window.getComputedStyle ) {\n+               fix8908 = ( window.getComputedStyle( elem, null ) || {} ).backgroundImage;\n+           }\n+\n            clone = elem.cloneNode( true );\n        // IE<=8 does not properly clone detached, unknown element nodes\n        } else {\n            ...\n        }\n        ...\n    },\n    ...\n});\n```\n#### Pros\n- The amount of code for this fix is relatively small\n- This code is limited to the clone execution path, which happens infrequently when compared to the `.css()` method approach in option #1.\n#### Cons\n- This relies on a weird quirk in IE9/10 to get around the problem, but it seems to be the most succinct. \n### 3. Have IE9 & IE10 Fix this Bug\n\nIt would be ideal if no patch had to be made to jQuery at all and IE9 and IE10 could apply a fix instead. Seeing that the issue is found in IE9 though may rule out this option entirely. \n#### Pros\n- No patch for jQuery would be needed\n#### Cons\n- Even if the bug was fixed immediately for IE9 & IE10 there would still be an issue with versions of IE9 that didn't have the IE fix.\n## Unit Test\n\nThe following Unit Test exposes the problem in IE9 and IE10. In browsers that don't support these styles I am skipping over them and asserting that they are not an issue. \n\n``` javascript\ntest( \"Clearing a Cloned Element's Style Shouldn't Clear the Original Element's Style (#8908)\", function() {\n    expect( 8 );\n\n    var baseUrl = document.location.href.replace( /([^\\/]*)$/, \"\" );\n    var styles = [\n        { name: \"background-attachment\", value: [ \"fixed\" ], expected: [ \"scroll\" ] },\n        { name: \"background-color\", value: [ \"rgb(255, 0, 0)\", \"rgb(255,0,0)\" ], expected: [ \"transparent\" ] },\n        { name: \"background-image\", value: [ 'url(\"test.png\")', 'url(' + baseUrl + 'test.png)', 'url(\"' + baseUrl + 'test.png\")' ], expected: [ \"none\" ] },\n        { name: \"background-position\", value: [ \"5% 5%\" ], expected: [ \"0% 0%\" ] },\n        { name: \"background-repeat\", value: [ \"repeat-y\" ], expected: [ \"repeat\" ] },\n        { name: \"background-clip\", value: [ \"content-box\" ], expected: [ \"border-box\" ] },\n        { name: \"background-origin\", value: [ \"content-box\" ], expected: [ \"padding-box\" ] },\n        { name: \"background-size\", value: [ \"80px 60px\" ], expected: [] }\n    ];\n\n    jQuery.each( styles, function(index, style) {\n        var $source, source, $clone;\n\n        style.expected = style.expected.concat( [ \"\", \"auto\" ] );\n        $source = jQuery( \"<div />\" );\n        source = $source[ 0 ];\n        if ( source.style[ style.name ] === undefined ) {\n            ok( true, style.name +  \": style isn't supported and therefore not an issue\" );\n            return true;\n        }\n        $source.css( style.name, style.value[0] );\n        $clone = $source.clone();\n        $clone.css( style.name, \"\" );\n\n        ok( ~jQuery.inArray( $source.css( style.name ), style.value ),\n            \"Clearning clone.css() doesn't affect source.css(): \" + style.name +\n            \"; result: \" + $source.css( style.name ) +\n            \"; expected: \" + style.value.join( \",\" ) );\n    });\n});\n```\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the research I have done testing 252 CSS styles I have isolated this issue to only 8 styles in IE9 and IE10. \n\nI've recommended solving this issue 3 different ways, but in the end _the 2nd option seems best to me_ since it only is executed in the clone execution path and is significantly smaller than the 1st option. The 3rd option of having IE fix this issue seems too late since the issue also affects IE9.\n",

This behavior is different than IE9 and previous versions. I looked into the HTML5 spec and it says that the NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR error should be thrown if the parent is a Document http://html5.org/specs/dom-parsing.html#dom-element-outerhtml My guess is that IE10 took that new spec and took it a little further.\n\nIn order to get around the issue, I am checking if the destination node has a parentNode before assigning to the outerHTML property. With this change IE10/9/8/7/6 all pass the current unit tests along with latest FF and Chrome releases. The code inside the cloneFixAttributes function that I modified is really to fix IE in the first place, so other browsers aren't really affected too much.\n\nI initially also added a check to verify that the nodeType was not 9 (Node.DOCUMENT_NODE), but the code block that I changed only pertains to the `object` nodeName and I can't think of a use case where it's parentNode would ever be a document, so I think it is safe to leave out this check and leave the fix as terse as possible to save some bytes ;) \n\nI may have been overgenerous with comments in this fix, but since it was an odd browser change I thought it might be helpful as I see other browser work arounds have similar comments. \n",

    "body": "jQuery currently does not have a curry function. Proxy does support arguments currying but will always overwrite the context. Sometimes I would like to only curry some arguments without setting an explicit context.\n\nI'm not sure if this already has been suggested, as the change is very small and quite obvious. This enables me to use it to only curry arguments without an explicit context:\n\nvar cb = jQuery.proxy(fn, null, 'arg1', 'arg2');\ncb.call(myobject, 'arg3');\n\nThe patch is very small and will not overwrite the context if it evaluates to false. Maybe this check should be more strict (typeof context == 'undefined' ? this : context)? I don't see a valid reason to set the context to something that evaluates to false!? What do you think?\n\nThanks for consideration and your time!\nHave a nice day!\n",

This creates a method on an array like `array['[]']`, which just returns itself (`this`):\n\n[ember-runtime/lib/mixins/enumerable.js#L623](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/3d8a3b301de8f602bf9842c15099d11307f35e96/packages/ember-runtime/lib/mixins/enumerable.js#L623)\n\nI think there are two bugs here:\n1. That part of `$.extend` should be using `hasOwnProperty`, but I'm not entirely sure about this. It returns false on accessors.\n2. I've added `if (options === copy) continue`, which wasn't covered with just `if (target === copy) continue`, which is the problem with a property pointing to itself.\n\nHere is where I ran into the error in some code:\n\n``` javascript\n[].hasOwnProperty('length') // true\n[].hasOwnProperty('[]') // false\nvar array = []\narray['[]'] === array // true\n```\n\nWould adding this fix it you think?\n\n``` javascript\nfor ( name in options ) {\n  if (options.hasOwnProperty(name)) {\n    src = target[ name ];\n    copy = options[ name ];\n  // ...\n```\n\nIt looks like this is probably a jQuery bug but it's getting late so I can't quite tell.\n\nTry running `$.extend(true, [])` in the web console with `Ember.USE_ACCESSORS = true`, and it should create an infinite loop.\n\n_(came across this using the jquery-file-upload plugin with ember accessors, it doesn't work b/c the ajax call it's making passes the files array into the `$.extend` method [right here](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/02efca019a3033c5320cbcc5f8bf01522de3c8b7/js/jquery.fileupload.js#L644))_\n",

When jQuery does this:\n\n```\nif ( unit !== \"px\" ) {\n    jQuery.style( this, p, (end || 1) + unit);\n    start = ( (end || 1) / e.cur() ) * start;\n    jQuery.style( this, p, start + unit);\n}\n```\n\nthe element width becomes 2px (Firefox rounds the width to 3px which seems a bit more reasonable). `start` becomes 47 (1/2 \\* 94) and the element is assigned a width of 47% (133px).\n\nThis fix does the computation twice, using the \"close but not quite\" value from the first computation as input for the second. I made a [calculator](http://jsfiddle.net/jefferyto/fexWp/) to see what effect this would have (as well as a potential third computation), and it seems the result is much more accurate.\n\nThis also fixes [11854](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11854) as the code was settings styles on `this`, which is the animation object in 1.8.\n",

HUGE! However, there are several ways we can make this smaller if we're willing to accept some minor speed loss. As always, well-factored, DRY code are on the opposite ends of the spectrum from optimizations:\n- make the code that subtracts the different box attributes from the supplied value in the setter into a function, as it's the opposite of the code in the here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/e93f2a89e277d3fffbc15b4ef82ebc3ac6a840f5/src/css.js#L312 The downside is another function call on the stack. I don't think it'll be a major hit as the function call is only a small piece of the work done when css is modfied and causing reflows. I can perf this separately if we're concerned.\n- introduce another function call onto the stack for outerWidth(false) and outerWidth(true) so that all of the inner/outer(false)/(true) function can be defined in a loop.\n- introduce new function signatures: contentWidth(),paddingWidth(),borderWidth(), and marginWidth() to make the intent of these functions clear, and make the signature the same for all of them. We can deprecate the old names, and keep them around until 1.9 or later, at which time, we gain the bytes back from the aliasing.\n\n@dmethvin, @rwldrn please let me know what you think. I know we all fought hard for the bytes we shaved off, but people have been asking for this for a while. If we are willing to accept a small perf degradation here, we can save a lot of those bytes, and I don't think it'll become a bottleneck.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nLatest is: \n\n```\nRunning \"compare_size:files\" (compare_size) task\nSizes - compared to master\n    252166      (+555)  dist/jquery.js                                         \n     93072      (+212)  dist/jquery.min.js                                     \n     33374      (+101)  dist/jquery.min.js.gz \n```\n\nI implemented all of the tricks I described above minus making new function names. \n",

Adding the sourceURL parameter to `globalEval` was pretty straight-forward, as was adding the ajax options object as a second parameter to converters so that the `\"text script\"` converter in `ajax/script.js` is able to provide said sourceURL parameter.\n\nHowever, when it comes to `load`, seeing as inline scripts need to refer to the loaded document as sourceURL, it's a bit hackish: has to pass through `html` then `append` then `domManip`.

I know I probably missed some detail in terms of style, testing, or something. :)\n\nThis is a fix for issue #6724, where the value of `$(window).height()` is always the value of the window height minus the address bar and debug console. The problem is that the value returned for `$(window).height` is accurate until you scroll. At which point the value of `window.innerHeight` is adjusted to reflect the correct height of the drawable area the Browser is using, but the `document`'s height properties are not.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by returning `window.innerHeight` for `$(window).height()` if it exists. If it doesn't exist, it will attempt to use height parameters from document and its children. Tests for the dimensions module are passing in the latest Chrome, Firefox, and Mobile Safari.\n\nSize changes:\n\n```\njQuery Size - compared to last make\n  252813    (+26) jquery.js\n   94786    (+15) jquery.min.js\n   33650    (+15) jquery.min.js.gz\n```\n\nLet me know what I did wrong! :)\n",

    "body": "So, if you are using a non-standards browser (IE<9), or if you asynchronously load jQuery, the current behavior is to fire jQuery.ready after all sub-resources load. This means if you have an IFRAME that takes a long time to load, you're prioritizing that content to load FIRST before your jQuery.ready code fires!\n\nNow, some people unfortunately use jQuery to manipulate contents of IFRAMES on their pages, and wait for .ready() to fire to do so. So, unfortunately, we need to continue supporting that functionality, while also allowing devs to prioritize their own content over iframes (especially considering the prevelance of IFRAMES these days).\n\nIntroducing, jQuery.quickReady! Set this flag to true before creating your .ready() code, but after jQuery has loaded, and jQuery will now fire ready when the DOM is ready to be manipulated, but before all subresources have loaded. \n\nExample uses are in the unit tests. In a future release, we can change the default to true if we've given enough time for people to adapt.There are some interesting edge cases, please read the unit tests as they account for all of the ones I was able to discover.\n\nAlso, I generalized some more of the testing framework to enable the tests here.

    "body": "So - I don't feel like this branch is by any means DONE... I just want an easy way for people to look at what I'm doing and discuss it. It currently passes all jQuery core unit tests in chrome so I figure its time to share it on a wider scale.  It currently weighs in around 150 bytes more than the current core after min and gzip.\n# jQuery 1.8 Effects\n\nTo quote my own summary from an email thread:\n\n> My goal in the end is to have a plugin to sit alongside jQuery 1.8 (like `jQuery.color.js`) which implements animations that CAN be done with transitions or css animations, yet lets all the \"complex\" animations fall through to the default provider in jQuery core.  This would allow you to define your animations in terms of CSS animation / transition style apis, and know that if the browser can't support CSS3, jQuery core will be doing what its doing now.  This plugin may or may not find its way into UI Effects Core as jQuery.color already has.\n## General organization\n\n`jQuery.Animation` is a new function which implements most of what our current `doAnimation` function hiding inside `jQuery.fn.animate` currently does.  It returns an animation object which has the standard promise methods ( `.done()` and `.fail()` ) plus a helper called `.finished()` to publish its state information to the outside world. `fail()` functions will be called with a boolean `gotoEnd` whenever someone `.stop()`s the animation. `.done()` functions will NOT be called on `.stop( gotoEnd )` but will be called whenever the animation comes to its natural completion.  `.finish()` functions will be called whenever the animation completes - regardless of it had been `.stop()`ed.\n\n`jQuery.Tween` is very similar to the old `jQuery.fx` (so much so that it is being used as such for backwards-compat).  It handles the actual easing/get/set operations for a single element and property from 0% to 100%.  Animations contain an array of Tweens that will be updated when their `tick` function is called.\n## New hook points\n### `jQuery.Animation.preFilter( function( element, props, opts ) {})`\n\nPre-filters allow a plugin to look at the `props` and `opts` of an animation being created and overide some default functionality, or do something else entirely with it.   The hide / show special case preFilter in the code is a good example.  It creates its own tweens for the hide and show scope to retain access to in the `finish()` callbacks it attaches to hook all of timmy's `fxstop` goodness together.  Pre-filters are allowed to return their own object so long as it implements `.stop( gotoEnd )`, and `.finish()`. `jQuery.fn.animate` will be none the wiser.\n### `jQuery.Animation.tweener( propsList, function( property, value ) {})`\n\nAllows you to peek at the property/value combinations and decide how to create a tween for that property or value.  It should return truthy if it created the tween.  If you want the tween to be managed by the animation you should use the `animation.createTween( property, value )` helper, or push your own object containing a `run( percent )` function to `animation.tweens` array.\n### `jQuery.Tween.propHooks[ property ]`\n\nA `{ get: function( tween ) {}, set: function( tween ) {} }` hook point for individual properties with a `_default` that uses `jQuery.css` and `element.style`\n## Current Issues\n- The \"special easing\" code right now bugs me because it really should run before the hide/show preFilter, but since makes it basically impossible to accept an array as a possible animated property value, anyone wanting an array value will have to prepend to the preFilter - perhaps not such a bad thing...\n- I have not yet tested this code for performance or potential memory leaks.\n- Should be `prefilter` to be in line with the example set by ajax: [`jQuery.ajaxPrefilter`](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/).  I would like to avoid making it `jQuery.animatePrefilter` so `jQuery.Animate.prefilter` makes more sense to me...\n",

    "body": "This `.editorconfig` file defines the indentation style used in all JavaScript files under `src/` and also for the `Makefile`.  Request related to jquery/jquery-ui#606.\n\nI did not add definitions for HTML, JS, or CSS files in the `build/` `speed/`, or `test/` directories because the indentation styles were not consistent enough for me to judge how they should be defined.\n\nBelow I noted some of the nuances of the indentation styles in the `build/` and `speed/` directories.  The `test/` directory also suffers from mixed indentation styles (sometimes in the same file).\n#### build/\n\n**tabs:**\n- build/sizer.js\n- build/release.js\n- build/release-notes.js\n- build/compile.js\n- build/jshint-check.js\n- build/freq.js\n- build/release-notes.txt\n\n**4 spaces:**\n- build/lib/jshint.js\n\n**8 spaces with 4 spaces for half indentation:**\n- build/uglify.js (except for line 7 which uses a 4 column width tabstop)\n- build/lib/parse-js.js\n- build/lib/process.js\n- build/lib/squeeze-more.js\n#### speed/\n\n**tabs:**\n- speed/css.html\n- speed/event.html\n- speed/slice.vs.concat.html\n- speed/jquery-basis.js (spaces mixed in on line 711)\n\n**primarily 2 spaces (with 2 column width tabstops mixed in occasionally):**\n- speed/closest.html\n- speed/filter.html\n- speed/find.html\n- speed/index.html\n- speed/benchmarker.js\n- speed/benchmark.js\n\n**no idea (heavily mixed spacing and tabbing style)**\n- speed/benchmarker.css\n\nIf maintaining consistent indentation for the files in these directories is desirable, I suggest that each file's indentation style should be made self-consistent first.\n\nFor example something like this may be appropriate for `build/`:\n\n```\n[build/*.js]\nindent_style = tab\n\n[build/uglify.js]\nindent_style = space\nindent_size = 4\n\n[build/lib/*.js]\nindent_style = space\nindent_size = 4\n```\n",

First time contributor...\n\nComment 3 from jaubourg mentions a suggestion that seemed the most reasonable. \n\nWith my change, it is possible to specify an empty string and an null value in an AJAX request or URLQueryString, however it is not possible to recognize an undefined value. I simply skip over those; reasoning is that one probably wouldn't want to specify that anyway.\n\nInteresting note, if you pass an array with an undefined element, you will lose information about the number of elements in that array in the URLQueryString. This is reflected in the unit tests; a two element array with one undefined value now shows up as a single element in the QueryString. Problem? Dunno, would love some input on if that would be the expected behavior!\n\ntks2103\n\nSize diff, for those interested.\n\n```\njQuery Size - compared to last make\n  252962    (+75) jquery.js\n   94869    (+23) jquery.min.js\n   33659    (+10) jquery.min.js.gz\n```\n",

However I have tested this file and it does work in requirejs. @unscriptable should probably also give it a whirl in curl to confirm the fix.\n\nIf it makes sense, I can do a test that can be placed in the test/ directory and load the dist/jquery.js file for the test, but I am not sure if there is precedent for that, or if it is good enough that some AMD folks have confirmed the fix.\n",

If it fails (you can't construct a new `HTMLDocument`), it decides `obj` is a window and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.\n  - If not (Firefox, IE), it checks if `obj.document.constructor` is an `HTMLDocument` by calling `toString()` and checking if \"HTMLDocument\" is a substring.\n\nI've run the test suite on Chrome 14, Firefox 6 and Opera 11 on Mac OS X, and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows XP.

In IE, `event.clientX` is defined even for key events, so some extra checking is necessary. Perhaps there's a better way to test for MouseEvents in IE?\n\n**This needs further testing.** I haven't been able to make a reduced test case and I'm not 100% confident that jQuery is to blame. In the app where I discovered this bug, I managed to fix it by altering the CSS instead (removing a `float:left` on a page with many elements -- might have been an IE-specific rendering inefficiency).\n\nSee http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6942 for details.\n",

The general idea is to artificially limit the interval between two animation ticks.\nThis was illustrated in Seth Ladd's \"Intro to HTML5 Game Development\" during Google I/O 2011: http://io-2011-html5-games-hr.appspot.com/#36\nHe calculates the time delta between two animation ticks and limit this value to 60ms\n\n```\nvar dT = Math.min( now - prevNow, 60 );\n```\n\nThe way jQuery animations work is more complex than Seth's ones, as animations aren't based on the time delta between the previous tick and the current one, but between the beginning of the animation (startTime) and the current one. The only way to limit the interval between two ticks is to move the value of startTime forward in time.\n\nWith this 5loc patch, jQuery detects when the interval takes longer than usual and moves startTime accordingly to effectively pause the animation. Once the tab is focused again, the animation continues where it stopped.\n",

The general idea here is you would set `jQuery.support.raf = false` in a codebase where you haven't gotten around to properly implementing design patterns necessary to avoid queuing new animations while they aren't running.\n\nI feel that no matter how much we try to educate the best practices mentioned in the ticket, there will still be situations where the end user can't manage to set up the animation queueing properly.\n\nAs coded, this flag can not be changed while animations are running, and thus, should only be set once (and only to false) before any animations are queued.\n\nIt is likely possible to replace the current `requestAnimationFrame` & `setInterval` code with a [\"recursive setTimeout pattern\"](http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/) that more closely approximates the rAF implementations.  If we were to do that, you could actually probably shorten the whole thing quite effectively, and allow toggling this flag while running.\n",

With this change, the logic is more consitent and futureproof. \n\njQuery has not to have a list of current widley used boolean content-attributes. Simply the developer has to decide, which attributes are boolean. \n\nThis also means, that HTML5 boolean attributes can be used the same way checked, disabled are used:\n\n```\n$.attr(video, 'controls', true); // sets controls=\"controls\"\n$.attr(input, 'required', false); // removes required\n```\n\nDue to the fact, that true/false are not valid values for content attributes and jQuery's attr already had a general abstraction for removing attributes (value === null), this change won't break anything (despite of some very rare cases using aria-\\* attributes without stringifying true/false) and makes attr more consistent.\n",

    "body": "Add support for registering jQuery as an AMD module. Only does so if the AMD loader indicates it has special allowances for multiple versions of jQuery being loaded in a page.\n\nThe \"special allowances\" should be:\n- Being able to restrict registration of jQuery to a specific version.\n- Allow multiple versions of jQuery to be loaded in a page if the loader supports different \"sandboxes\" for defined modules.\n\nAn AMD loader needs to have these special allowances for jQuery since jQuery is commonly used by third-party libs used in pages that can load more than one version of jQuery in a page. While this conceptually could happen with any library/toolkit script, jQuery's popularity make it an actual issue, and an AMD loader needs to be able to account for it, or specifically tells its users the restrictions it has with its use and jQuery.\n\nWith [this RequireJS commit](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/commit/a5715e6293eb6a13e44135f8d4dfd728d3a1a68e), RequireJS demonstrates meeting these allowances by allowing the developer to specify the version of jQuery they want to allow registered, so if more than one jQuery with a define() call happens, RequireJS will only pay attention to the desired version. The RequireJS commit contains some unit tests to show either 1.4.4 for 1.5.2  being used depending on version set in the RequireJS config.\n\nThis helps avoid the issue of some other third party code on a page accidentally loading a version of jQuery the main page developer was not expecting and have it clobber the one that was desired.\n\nRequireJS also supports \"contexts\" that act like \"sandboxes\" and allow the developer to load two different versions of jQuery to be loaded and used in a page, as long as jQuery uses define() to register.\n\nRequireJS 1.0 can support this model if/when jQuery decides to accept this pull request, as long as we agree that define.amd.jQuery === true is the capability name/test. If the jQuery project prefers a different capability name, just let me know (preferably within the next week), and I can have the capability flag in the RequireJS 1.0 release.\n\nThis pull request includes a define qunit test that was originally authored by csnover, but changed to fit the current suggested capability check.\n",

    "body": "Here is a summary of all the changes:\n- Added hooks for selected, checked, readonly, disabled to removeAttr if set to false\n- Removed all attrs from attrFix, these aren't needed for setAttribute in most browsers.\n- If prop is used for class, do we want a propFix for class?\n  - We could just assume the user should know to use className with prop.  I've done the latter for now.\n- Created tests for $.fn.prop and $.fn.removeProp (really just moved broken attr tests to prop where it made sense)\n- Switch the \"selected\" attrHook to a propHook\n- Removed jQuery.hasAttr.\n  - Doing get/setAttribute on a non-existant attribute is fine.\n- Added jQuery.support.getSetAttribute to feature test ie6/7 support for get/setAttribute on camelCase attributes and forms.\n- Added jQuery.removeAttr\n  - If get/setAttribute is not sufficiently supported (and therefore .removeAttribute), fall back to DOM level 1 removeAttributeNode along with setting the attr to empty string to ensure as much removal as possible.\n- Remove check for undefined in the getter hook (some attributes expect undefined in the return value, such as tabIndex)\n- Forms get special treatment in browsers that do not have necessary support for get/setAttribute(IE6-7), which fixes several bugs.  See next:\n- Bugs that have been fixed and can be closed (or remove patchwelcome) with these updates:\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/3113\">3113</a> (forms with an input with name=\"action\" conflicts with setting action attr on the form)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/3116\">3116</a> (.attr does not work with svg idls)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/3685\">3685</a> (form with an input name=\"name\" caused conflict)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/3783\">3783</a> (removeAttr to use props or $.attrFix)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/5413\">5413</a> (getting width and height content attribute wasn't supported on display: none elements)\n  - <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6708\">6708</a> (opera has inconsistent result for usemap attribute value)\n  - <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6562\">6562</a> (when a form contained an input with id=target, target was not settable in IE)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/7472\">7472</a> (name=\"id\", getting an attr on a form element that was contained within the name of one of it's inputs returned that input in IE6/7)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/8117\">8117</a> (removeAttr did not work with a select element's size attribute in F4)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/8150\">8150</a> (removeAttr on height was causing height to go to 0)\n  - <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8255\">8255</a> (list attribute support)\n  - <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8457\">8457</a> (This is the attrHooks enhancement ticket)\n  - On a side note, <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/7818\">7818</a> is related.  The new prop/removeProp methods are able to get, set, and remove properties on plain objects passed to jQuery.\n- Added multiple tests to check these bugs in $.attr\n\nFor more bugs related to attr, see http://oksoclap.com/attrhooks-bugs\n",

We could theoretically privatize valHooks taking it off of jQuery and only use it internally for our own convenience, but again, I do not believe this patch carries with it the dangers of the first proposal.\n- Slightly improved performance of val on radios and checkboxes for browsers that support checkOn, given the conditional attachment of its hook.\n### Performance\n- http://jsperf.com/valhooks-vs-val\n  - There is a noticeable improvement in getting the value\n  - Setting looks about the same, maybe a slight decrease, probably due to accessing nodeName and type on the elem.\n",

    "body": "Here is a summary of all the changes:\n- Added hooks for selected, checked, readonly, disabled to removeAttr if set to falsy\n- Removed all attrs from attrFix, these aren't needed for setAttribute in most browsers.\n- If prop is used for class, do we want a propFix for class?\n  - We could just assume the user should know to use className with prop.  I've done the latter for now.\n- Created tests for $.fn.prop and $.fn.removeProp (really just moved broken attr tests to prop where it made sense)\n- Switch the \"selected\" attrHook to a propHook and make the style attrHook also a propHook\n- Removed jQuery.hasAttr.\n  - Doing get/setAttribute on a non-existant attribute is fine.\n- Added jQuery.support.getSetAttribute to feature test ie6/7 support for get/setAttribute on camelCase attributes and forms.\n- Added jQuery.removeAttr\n  - If get/setAttribute is not sufficiently supported (and therefore .removeAttribute), fall back to DOM level 1 removeAttributeNode along with setting the attr to empty string to ensure as much removal as possible.\n- Remove check for undefined in the getter hook (some attributes expect undefined in the return value, such as tabIndex)\n- Forms get special treatment in browsers that do not have necessary support for get/setAttribute(IE6-7), which fixes several bugs.  See next:\n- Bugs that have been fixed and can be closed (or remove patchwelcome) with these updates:\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/3113\">3113</a> (forms with an input with name=\"action\" conflicts with setting action attr on the form)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/3116\">3116</a> (.attr does not work with svg idls)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/3685\">3685</a> (form with an input name=\"name\" caused conflict)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/3783\">3783</a> (removeAttr to use props or $.attrFix)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/5413\">5413</a> (getting width and height content attribute wasn't supported on display: none elements)\n  - <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6708\">6708</a> (opera has inconsistent result for usemap attribute value)\n  - <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6562\">6562</a> (when a form contained an input with id=target, target was not settable in IE)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/7472\">7472</a> (name=\"id\", getting an attr on a form element that was contained within the name of one of it's inputs returned that input in IE6/7)\n  - <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/8117\">8117</a> (removeAttr did not work with a select element's size attribute in F4)\n  - <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8255\">8255</a> (list attribute support)\n  - On a side note, <a href=\"http://jqbug.com/7818\">7818</a> is related.  The new prop/removeProp methods are able to get, set, and remove properties on plain objects passed to jQuery.\n- Added multiple tests to check these bugs in $.attr\n\nFor more bugs related to attr, see http://oksoclap.com/attrhooks-bugs\n",

But we all know that Mircrosoft failed to implement the XMLHttpRequest in IE7.\nSo the XMLHttpRequest in IE7 aborts with an error if you fire an ajax request _without_ protocol in url. The easiest way to get around is to add the protocol to the url if it´s missing.\n- Request to http://fail.tld/tempalte/dialog\n  $.ajax({\n  url : '//fail.tld/tempalte/dialog'\n  });\n\nI hope you push my little commit into the 1.5 branch.\n\nBest regards,\n Sören\n\njsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/WuGZh/\nBug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5866\n",

It also changes the way the data functions work on plain JS objects as a result. Users can still access internal data if they need to, but uses `jQuery.expando` as a key, so it is nearly impossible for collision to occur with any key that a user would reasonably use.\n2. This patch includes changes to the unit testing framework that check and report any time a unit test leaks data in any of the jQuery globals. It also cleans up all of the tests that had been leaking.\n3. domManip was leaking an element when appending to a list of multiple elements by never using the first element and always cloning. This patch fixes this issue.\n4. jQuery.dequeue was not properly cleaning up and removing empty queues. This patch fixes this issue.\n",

This also adds two new support tests, `inlineBlockNeedsLayout` and `shrinkWrapBlocks`.\n\nIE6 needed some additional fixes, since any element with layout will shrink-wrap its content instead of allowing the content to flow outside the bounding box. IE7 does not exhibit this behaviour. This means that now, _overflow is not reset after a width/height animation in IE6_. This part can be backed out (it is the only thing in the last two commits), but doing so means that unit tests for animations that test the width/height of elements after an animation will fail in IE6 because the elements are shrink wrapped to their content size. (There was one test that was doing this in the original test suite, but the test was invalid because it was operating on an element inside a container with display: none, so it succeeded when it should have failed. The test suite has been updated to use offscreen drawing so this does not happen again in the future.)\n\nBug [#4512](http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/4512) needed to be fixed in order to properly implement the changes for #2185, as the update exposed this broken functionality in IE when trying to show() table elements. This fix basically involves checking at init whether it’s safe to rely on the offsetWidth/Height for elements that have had `display: none` set directly; if it isn’t, then the CSS property is also checked. This adds a new support test, `reliableHiddenOffsets`.\n\nBug [#7111](http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/7111) is just a quick enhancement to already existing functionality that I was able to throw in with the rest of the changes in about 5 minutes. Nothing special here, except to note that unlike other browsers, IE does not change the `overflow` property if `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` both match, so all 3 end up needing to be reset.\n\nI tried to keep the animate stuff and the :visible stuff in separate commits so that they can be landed separately if needed.\n\nCheers,\n",

    "body": "Fix for http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/5537.  If you look at jQuery UI's draggable demo page in Opera or run the draggable tests in the project, you can see Opera is consistently a significant distance off.  The root cause of this is that, in Opera, when position is static or relative and left/top are not set, Opera returns the absolute position from getComputedStyle while Webkit browsers and Firefox either return 0px or auto.  If the values are set, it seems to return those values as expected.  \n\nThe proposed fix is to detect this error case in support and adding a new hook to cssHooks to always return auto if position is static and to return auto if the returned value is equal to the absolute position (from getBoundingClientRect).  Making this change fixes this difference and also causes most of the draggable tests in the jQuery UI test suite to pass on Opera.  \n\nTwo notes/questions on this while seeing this\n1. I wasn't sure if there was a better way to handle these conditional cases within the cssHooks function than just having all the if statements.  Since I didn't see a ton of these types of fixes, I opted not to overengineer, but I'll admit I don't have a ton of experience writing javascript and might be missing something.\n2. I started working on this just before the changes to .css and at that time if the elem.style.left property was set .css would return that value (which would in turn make my fix for static a regression).  I noticed in the new .css behavior that this is not the case, but that now there's a new difference in the browsers (i added a test case for this in the css tests).  Now when position is static and there is an inline left/top value, Webkit browsers appear to still return auto, but Firefox and IE return the assigned values.  The test case I added just specified em values for static, but px units yield the same issue.\n",

V8 is now scarily close to being able to instantiate two instances of jQuery in the same millisecond. The only way I can think of to reliably do this (keeping in mind the case where two copies of jQuery are deeply noConflicted), is to explicitly pass in a unique prefix.\n\nThis patch reduces normal conflicts between different versions of jQuery by adding in the version to the expando, and also exposes a second parameter to jQuery.noConflict\n\nFor example:\n\n<include jQuery>\nmyJQ = jQuery.noConflict(true, 'myUniquePrefix');\n\nGenerally, this is necessary for third party widgets that use jQuery and don't want to collide with whatever is on the page.\n\nI did add a check to not allow a prefix to be added if the jQuery.cache had been used, that way no connections would be lost between old expando values. The best-practice here being that you call this new noConflict(true, 'prefix') before you use anything in the library.\n\nTest cases are provided (and passing) for both the case when a prefix is added with or without an empty jQuery.cache.\n",
