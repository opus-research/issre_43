      "Looks good in general. There are some test failures, I triggered the CI again to see if the tests still fail.\r\n\r\nAny chance you could create a test that writes -> parses -> writes to see if the output stays the same?",
      "@hmottestad I have added two additional tests that check to which extend the format is preserved in a round trip. While the data is isomorphic, the actual serialization is different.\r\n\r\nE.g. if I parse this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprefix server-news: <news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.> .\r\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\r\nserver-news:unix rdfs:label \"News on Unix\" .\r\nserver-news:windows rdfs:label \"News on Windows\" .\r\n```\r\n\r\nand serialize it out again, it comes out as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@prefix server-news: <news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.> .\r\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\r\n<news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix> rdfs:label \"News on Unix\" .\r\n<news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.windows> rdfs:label \"News on Windows\" .\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat seems to be because the `AbstractRDFParser` fails to consider the namespace declarations from the Turtle when generating the IRI instances.\r\n\r\nWhile I think that should also be fixed, it seems to me a) worth a new issue, b) a larger change and for me personally, I'm currently more interested in the serialization than in the parsing - so I'd defer that.\r\n\r\nSo if we decide to keep these tests, at least the string comparison on the Turtle serialization would need to be removed or commented out until the parser properly respects the prefix declarations in the source file.\r\n\r\nI have added a new issue for this: https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/4929",
      "So a the reason why `testPerformance(org.eclipse.rdf4j.rio.rdfxml.RDFXMLPrettyWriterBackgroundTest)` fails the is that the RDFXML writer actually respects prefix/namespace/localname delarations in IRIs, but because the test actually declares a IRI with an invalid localname, the test breaks due to the change that `SImpleIRI` now actually preserves this properly.\r\n\r\n**org.eclipse.rdf4j.rio.RDFWriterTest.RDFWriterTest(RDFWriterFactory, RDFParserFactory)**\r\n```\r\nexNs = \"http://example.org/\";\r\nuri5 = vf.createIRI(exNs, \"uri5/you\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the improvement to `SimpleIRI` to properly preserve namespace and localname, this was serialized as\r\n```\r\n<you xmlns=\"http://example.org/uri5/\" rdf:about=\"http://example.org/49/a111\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this comes out as\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ex:uri5/you rdf:about=\"http://example.org/49/a111\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Turtle module, I check now if using a prefixed version would create an invalid Turtle syntax and if this is the case, I use the pointy-brackets notation.\r\n\r\nI guess RDFXML (and maybe other formats) would need a similar change as well...",
      "@hmottestad Ok, I added a check into the `RDFXMLPrettyWriter` to prevent illegal local names from being written - if such a name is encountered, the system will instead try to generate a valid local name.",
      "I am not sure if it is desirable to preserve the initial namespace-localname-split in SimpleIRI. How does this influence the behavior of the generic IRI interface? \r\nIf the IRI is stored in NativeStore or LmdbStore in between then the original components will be lost.",
      "@kenwenzel for my use-case, I do not really care if prefixed and namespaces are always preserved. But what I care for is that if I build a model in which I explicitly declare prefixes/namespaces and also if I create IRIs with explicit namespaces, then this should be respected.\r\n\r\nIn general, I would think it would be sensible to also respect declared namespaces and prefixes when reading IRIs from a store into a model and then serializing them into a file. If the model has prefix declarations, then it would be sensible to try matching the IRI against these prefixes and then use the best match. But this would be slower then just doing an IRI namespace lookup in the prefix table, so I opted for the moment against implementing that.",
      "@hmottestad how can we proceed here?",
      "@reckart this fix here and the other fix you've contributed are released in 4.3.11. ",
      "Wow, a release specifically with my contributions :) That is a great easter present 👍 Thanks."

      "@JervenBolleman I've run into a more general issue with your rewrite of the `SPARQLQueryComplianceTest` class et al. because the JUnit 5 `@TestFactory` annotation doesn't work very well with the `@TempDir` annotation. In fact `@TestFactory` doesn't work well with any of the lifecycle annotations, including before each. Essentially the combination of `@TestFactory` and `@TempDir` means that we use the same temporary directory for all the tests in a class, instead of a new sail and repository with a new temporary directory for each and every test.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been masked by the test code catching exceptions. Pretty much none of the NativeStore tests have been running. I managed to get the NativeStore tests working now, but the LmdbStore doesn't seem so happy about being continuously re-instantiated on top of the directory for an existing LmdbStore. @kenwenzel maybe you could take a look at why the LmdbStore gets upset after a while when being shutdown and then recreated on the same directory. You should be able to reproduce the issues by running `LmdbPARQL11UpdateComplianceTest`.",
      "Oh no, I am so sorry for this! I ran into this in the RepositorySPARQLComplianceTestSuite and didn't think to see where else the same problem could have hidden. I am going to quickly see if the same fix can apply here.\r\n\r\n",
      "\"Aldri så galt at det ikke er godt for noe\" - Norwegian way to say that even when bad things happen they still bring something good. The ExtensibleStore test failing led to discovering the issue with the tests here, and that led to discovering the issue with the LmdbStore :)\r\n\r\nMaybe a quick fix is to add a File or Path param to the creeateRepo method and manually handle the creating and deletion of temporary directories.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to try to use the ParamaterizedTest annotation with the method source option. I do this with the ShaclSail where I read the directory structure to generate the tests at runtime.\r\n\r\nIt's still really nice to be able to run just a single test from IntelliJ though! Instead of always having to run every single one like I had to before.",
      "I tried to create a dir per dynamic test. Still have the failing extensiblestore test. Native and Lmdb tests seem to run?\r\nThe code is in [pull:4888](https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/pull/4888)",
      "Yeah, I think the ExtensibleStore failure is unrelated. It uses a ConcurrentHashMap as the main data structure when running the tests, so maybe there are some changes to that class in jdk 21 that is causing the issue. Not sure what it could be, and it's particularly annoying that I can't reproduce it in IntelliJ. ",
      "I found out that the issue with the ExtensibleStore was that it was sometimes not returning all the named contexts/graphs. It would stop the iterator on the first default graph (null). So a slight difference in the ordering of statements when run with JDK 21 through Maven was what was triggering the bug.",
      "@hmottestad I could imagine that something is not correctly closed when unsing the LmdbStore. Have you checked that everything gets closed after running the tests?",
      "From what I could see everything is closed correctly, but I haven't done anything more than look over the code. ",
      "Is the store instantiated with an empty directory or are there any artifacts left from the previous run?\r\nIt might also be the case that the store is not correctly closed due to some issue like\r\nhttps://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/4806\r\n\r\nI'll try to take a look within the next days.",

      "@abrokenjester @kenwenzel I'm working on support merge join. The first step is to add support for the sail to return ordered statements. I would really appreciate some feedback on how to make my changes as consistent as possible with the existing interfaces. Any suggestions on naming is also very welcome.",

      "> @hmottestad I can offer to add support for ordered indexes to LmdbStore. Do you already have any performance figures?\r\n\r\nThis would be really awesome. I've tagged you above in a comment to show what needs to be implemented. That should hopefully be all that is needed. One thing I'm not certain about is transaction isolation, so it might be best to test it out with IsolationLevels.NONE. There is also some work left to be done on the DualUnionIteration, let me know if you run into the UnsupportedOperationException in that class.\r\n\r\nI haven't made any benchmarks, mostly because I've only implemented this in the ExtensibleStore with a backing data structure that sorts the data for each request.  That is just so I can test things out locally. The end goal is for https://github.com/the-qa-company/qEndpoint to use it for analytical queries. They have a really innovative product that uses HDT for storing the data on disk and can work with massive datasets using very little memory.\r\n\r\nThe queries that we want to support are ones that would anyway need to read most of the data from a range query on the index.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n```\r\nselect (count(?a) as ?count) where {\r\n    ?a a foaf:Person; # using a OPSC index\r\n       foaf:age ?age. # using a PSOC index\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to see if the query planner chooses merge join you can use the query explanation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExplanation explain = connection\r\n    .prepareTupleQuery(query)\r\n    .explain(Explanation.Level.Executed);\r\nSystem.out.println(explain);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you should see `Join (InnerMergeJoinIterator)` in the query explanation. \r\n\r\nHere is an example for a completely different query:\r\n```\r\nProjection (resultSizeActual=5)\r\n╠══ ProjectionElemList\r\n║     ProjectionElem \"s\"\r\n║     ProjectionElem \"o\"\r\n║     ProjectionElem \"o2\"\r\n║     ProjectionElem \"s2\"\r\n║     ProjectionElem \"o3\"\r\n╚══ Join (JoinIterator) (resultSizeActual=5)\r\n   ├── Join (InnerMergeJoinIterator) (resultSizeActual=5) [left]\r\n   │  ╠══ Join (InnerMergeJoinIterator) (resultSizeActual=5) [left]\r\n   │  ║  ├── StatementPattern [statementOrder: S]  (costEstimate=0, resultSizeEstimate=0, resultSizeActual=5) [left]\r\n   │  ║  │     s: Var (name=s)\r\n   │  ║  │     p: Var (name=_const_9285ccfc_uri, value=http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label, anonymous)\r\n   │  ║  │     o: Var (name=o)\r\n   │  ║  └── StatementPattern [statementOrder: S]  (costEstimate=0, resultSizeEstimate=0, resultSizeActual=14) [right]\r\n   │  ║        s: Var (name=s)\r\n   │  ║        p: Var (name=_const_44b0da67_uri, value=http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment, anonymous)\r\n   │  ║        o: Var (name=o2)\r\n   │  ╚══ StatementPattern [statementOrder: S]  (costEstimate=0, resultSizeEstimate=0, resultSizeActual=14) [right]\r\n   │        s: Var (name=s)\r\n   │        p: Var (name=_const_531c5f7d_uri, value=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows, anonymous)\r\n   │        o: Var (name=s2)\r\n   └── StatementPattern (costEstimate=0, resultSizeEstimate=0, resultSizeActual=5) [right]\r\n         s: Var (name=s2)\r\n         p: Var (name=_const_44b0da67_uri, value=http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment, anonymous)\r\n         o: Var (name=o3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Two issues are causing this, the first is that the `txnLockManager` can't be forcefully unlocked by another thread, the second is that the `txnLockManager` is being locked without support for interruptions.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to track the owner thread of the connection and interrupt that thread. Since connections shouldn't be shared between threads we can assume that the thread that created the connection is the owner.\r\n\r\n<!-- short description of your change goes here -->\r\n\r\n----\r\nPR Author Checklist (see the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details):\r\n\r\n - [x] my pull request is [self-contained](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/merge-strategy/#self-contained-changes-pull-requests-and-commits)\r\n - [x] I've added tests for the changes I made\r\n - [x] I've applied [code formatting](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting) (you can use `mvn process-resources` to format from the command line)\r\n - [x] I've [squashed](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/squashing) my commits where necessary \r\n - [x] every commit message starts with the issue number (GH-xxxx) followed by a meaningful description of the change\r\n\r\n",

I had initially tracked it back to https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/3601 and reverting the changes to the FilterIterator seemed to fix the issue. However while I was working on the tests to reproduce it locally I managed to accidentally create yet another scoping scenario that was not solved by simply reverting the FilterIterator.",

      "That query is really odd. Does the graph scope apply to **everything** within it? Would the same be the case if it contained something like a FILTER NOT EXISTS? \n\nI assume it's illegal to have two GRAPH declarations, but I kinda wonder what would happen if the inner SELECT contained its own GRAPH declaration. ",
      "I'm actually thinking that it's a variable scoping issue.\r\n\r\n```sparql\r\nprefix ex:  http://www.example.org/schema#\r\nprefix in:  http://www.example.org/instance#\r\n\r\nselect ?x where {\r\n  graph ?g {\r\n    {\r\n      select ?x where { ?x ?p ?g }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince SPARQL has bottom-up semantics the inner SELECT query should be executed without knowledge of the outer variables. It's only when the results from the SELECT query bubble up that they get \"filtered\" by any variables that are bound in the outer scope.\r\n\r\nSince `?g` isn't declared in the projection of the inner SELECT query then it should not be affected by the outer `?g` bound to the named graph.\r\n\r\nConsider the following query:\r\n\r\n```sparql\r\nprefix ex:  http://www.example.org/schema#\r\nprefix in:  http://www.example.org/instance#\r\n\r\nselect ?x ?a ?b ?c where {\r\n  graph ?g {\r\n    {\r\n      select ?x ?g where { ?x ?p ?g }\r\n    }\r\n    ?a ?b ?c.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the inner SELECT produces results for both `?x` and `?g`. The outer `?g` in the graph declaration will be bound by the bindings from the inner SELECT, which in turn will affect the `?a ?b ?c.` line.\r\n\r\nIf we remove `?g` from the projection of the inner SELECT:\r\n\r\n```sparql\r\nprefix ex:  http://www.example.org/schema#\r\nprefix in:  http://www.example.org/instance#\r\n\r\nselect ?x ?a ?b ?c where {\r\n  graph ?g {\r\n    {\r\n      select ?x where { ?x ?p ?g }\r\n    }\r\n    ?a ?b ?c.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen now the `graph ?g` declaration is unbound. Se we would return results for `?a ?b ?c` from all graphs without being affect by the `?g` within the inner SELECT.\r\n",

I don't think we ever use it (or recommend using it) for somehow allowing a _user_ to reference a bnode by id remotely.\r\n> \r\n> Also: we tend to use RDF Binary everywhere else to support this: why choose RDF/JSON in this case?\r\n\r\nI haven't tried using RDF Binary. I'll test it out.\r\n\r\nThe reason I need to preserve blank node identifiers is that this is a transfer of the validation exception from the server to the client. The user would then typically want to find out more about what went wrong by retrieving the full shape from the server. It's common practice to use blank nodes for PropertyShape(s), so that's why we need to preserve the blank node identifiers.",

      "@hmottestad Thank you for your support :-). I'll try to take a look within the next days. The best would be to get rid of shallowClone completely but I am not sure if this is possible.",
      "I think I introduced shallowClone so that I could optimise the close method. Without shallowClone() a Changeset will be used after it has been closed, which really shouldn't be the case anyway. \n\nYou could split out the performance stuff into its own branch/PR and then focus on the close() stuff separately. I still think it's hard to trace down all the places where the Changeset should/shouldn't be closed and that's it's easier to call it best effort and instead use a Java 9 Cleaner (or preferably our own ConcurrentCleaner) to close any overflow model that doesn't get closed correctly by the Changeset.",

They'd basically just need to use those same methods when reading a config model to allow both old and new config files to co-exist.\r\n\r\nIt'll definitely help once I get around to migrating to the new vocabulary. At the moment though I consider it a breaking change that it's not possible to upgrade to 4.3.0 unless that change is used consistently throughout the code.",
      "@abrokenjester I did come up with an idea during the night. We could introduce a setting somewhere (env maybe) that turns off the support for the current (legacy) vocabulary. So users who want to migrate to the new vocabulary and be ready for 5.0.0 can flip that switch.\r\n\r\nIn 5.0.0 we will stop duplicating everything by using both the new and legacy vocabulary. We will also flip over the priority from the legacy vocabulary to the new one in  the Configurations util, and maybe add some assertions to stop conflicts from happening. \r\n\r\nFor anyone who isn't working with the models directly the change should be seamless. If they migrate 4.x.0 -> 5.0.0 they will never see any duplicate use of the new/legacy vocabulary. If they migrate 4.x.0 -> 4.3.0 -> 5.0.0 the config files will have duplicates in 4.3.0, but those will be cleaned up in 5.0.0.",
      "A completely different alternative would be to provide the new vocabulary and Configurations util in 4.3.0, but only start using it in 5.0.0. \r\n\r\nWe would still use the Configurations util when reading the config model to support those who want to start migrating now, but we would only write using the current (legacy) vocabulary.",
      "I should really have gotten more involved when this was still in the PR phase, but I'm not sure I would have seen the issues that I've discovered now.",
      "You're completely right of course that if this breaks existing apps, then we have to rethink it. I think the main thing for me is that I still don't fully understand how this is a breaking change though: any Config class we have is set up to read either old or new properties (so it can deal with legacy data as well as new vocabulary), and the methods that write these configs to file have all been fixed to consistently produce new vocabulary. Can you give a code example of how this is used in existing code (in either GraphDB or somewhere else) that would break with this setup? I must be overlooking some obvious use case.",
      "Here is one place where there is an issue in GraphDB: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1089\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 17 27 30\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/797185/235963630-5dfdb73b-bb20-4946-be69-41cd6919ed41.png\">\r\n\r\nI don't know what this code does, or why it needs to use the vocabulary directly. I don't see anything particularly wrong with this code though. It assumes that the model uses the current (deprecated) vocabulary and fails now that we only use the new vocabulary.",
      "That looks like it might be from a config class in GraphDB itself? Just like our own config classes have a parse method.\n\nIf we stuck with the current approach, this code would need to change to use the Configurations fallback method we are currently using ourselves, or something better/easier to use.\n\nThe question is: do we consider this sufficiently a breaking change to roll it back, or to introduce something that leaves us with ugly config files that duplicate info? Or can we consider this sufficiently niche that providing some upgrade notes to adapt such cases is good enough?\n\nFwiw if we decide it should be rolled back I'd be in favour of just completely removing from 4.3, and adding to the 5.0 branch instead.",
      "It's a kind of breaking change that is really hard to debug because it ends up causing a strange exception way down the line with no indication that it's caused by that code until you look into the deprecation warnings. \n\nStability of namespaces and vocabulary is a big part of the semantic web, so it feels a like more of a fundamental breaking change when we change it up in a minor release. ",
      "Ok - I had originally though that this wouldn't be such a big issue because the use cases of directly interacting with the RDF data for config are vanishingly rare. But I agree that I may have underestimated that and we really should be treating this as a breaking change.\r\n\r\nI suggest that, instead of trying to \"fix\" the change, we just take it out of the 4.3 release, and instead apply it on the 5.0 branch. ",
      "Update: that may not be as simple as I expected. I hadn't realized this was already merged more than 2 months ago. Github won't even let me create a revert PR from the original PR, too much has changed since then.\r\n\r\nOk let's suck it up, and just accept that for 4.3 we'll have ugly config files with duplicate data. I hate it, it's bad design and a bad experience for most of our users, but a breaking change is a breaking change. ",

      "@hmottestad I've just realised that we've already got a milestone out with these changes in, and I think @aschwarte10 has already prepped their product to work with this.\n\nI don't think we can back out anymore. We either go with what we have and provide upgrade guidance, or we go with some halfway approach to make it backward compatible .",
      "Milestone builds are not releases, so we can roll back the changes if we want to. It's not the best thing to do though, in general. \n\nCould you comment @aschwarte10 and let us know if you've already migrated over to the new config vocabulary that was included in the milestone build?",
      " \r\n> Could you comment @aschwarte10 and let us know if you've already migrated over to the new config vocabulary that was included in the milestone build?\r\n\r\nThe change with the repository configuration schema has not been part of 4.3.0 M1 and thus we have not yet done any migration. We required 4.3.0 M1 mostly for the Jakarta changes in the core modules (related to Jaxb).\r\n\r\nAnd even if we already did migrations:  as @hmottestad said - this is milestone releases. For me it is perfectly fine to roll back things if they do not work out. It is just important that the GA releases are in good shape.",
      "Cool, I can live with that: fully agree that we can do this for milestones, just wanted to make sure we weren't creating a heap of extra work for metaphacts. @hmottestad really appreciate you giving a revert a go. Hopefully you can do it in a way that we can merge it into the 5.0 branch instead. Shout if you need a hand. ",

      "Since the old config classes are probably widely in use by users I think it might be a good idea to not remove them in 5.0.0 and leave them around until 6.0.0 so that users have extra long time to migrate their code.",

      "> @abrokenjester I was looking at the new CONFIG class that you introduced and have some suggestions for changes.\r\n> \r\n> I propose we use Config instead of CONFIG. I haven't looked into why you went with CONFIG to begin with, but I was thinking that it breaks with our current naming conventions and I wasn't sure why.\r\n\r\nWe discussed this when I put up the original change - see https://www.eclipse.org/lists/rdf4j-dev/msg02136.html. The consensus was that we'd stick with all capitals because although that breaks with our general class naming conventions, it aligns it with the convention that we use for all other vocabulary classes. They're all named for their prefix name, in all caps.\r\n\r\n> I also noticed that there are some new abbreviations that I think will be confusing to users. I propose using the class names for the classes that the configs apply to. So `Config.CustomGraphQueryInferencer` instead of `Config.Cgqi`. I see that it messes a bit with the IntelliJ autocomplete, so maybe we could go with a suffix of sorts?\r\n\r\nTwo things:\r\n\r\n1. the abbreviations align with what is used in the actual URIs - so ideally if you want to change these abbreviations you'll have to adapt the actual URIs as well (and make sure that all templates are adapted, too);\r\n2. I chose the abbreviations based on brevity, both from a Java point of view _and_ for the actual RDF vocabulary itself. I agree that some, like `Cgqi` and `Ca`, are not the most intuitive, so happy to discuss alternatives, but I'd rather not go with the full class name as that makes it all _very_ verbose.\r\n\r\n",
      "Sorry for not following along when this was being discussed. \n\nThe main issue with the abbreviations is that they are really hard for users to discover. They have to read the Java docs to understand that the config for the ElasticsearchStore is now in ess.\n\nI really believe we need to help users with discoverability. Maybe we could add a constant to all the main classes that point to the relevant vocabulary. For instance ElasticsearchStore.CONFIG would be equal to CONFIG.ess, and that way we would still maintain the vocabulary in a single location without any duplication. ",
      "> The main issue with the abbreviations is that they are really hard for users to discover. They have to read the Java docs to understand that the config for the ElasticsearchStore is now in ess.\r\n\r\nYMMV, but I don't find that \"hard to discover\". The IDE warns if a class or field is deprecated when you use it, as soon as you hover over it the javadoc tells you where to look for the replacement. \r\n\r\nThat said, anything we can do to make it even easier is welcome of course :) \r\n\r\n> I really believe we need to help users with discoverability.

      "I think I'll just leave things as they are here and instead look into adding some way to link to the relevant vocabulary from within the different sails and repos. Hopefully it's as easy as introducing a constant.\r\n\r\nI'll think about the abbreviations for a bit and see if I can come up with anything that is cleared without being too long."

Could you perhaps add some review comments inline yourself to explain what this is doing and why? \r\n\r\nEDIT - I took another look and I think that jogged my brain into gear a little. As I understand it, this PR tries to achieve two things:\r\n\r\n1. remove all existing dependencies on java EE modules (the reason we want this is to enable us to switch to Jakarta later on?)\r\n2. add something in the enforcer plugin to make sure we don't accidentally put them back in?\r\n\r\nMore generally though I am still a little lost in the various Java EE / Jakarta-related PRs that have been put up, which ones depend on which, and which ones are on the critical path. It would really help if you linked each PR with a concrete issue that describes what needs solving. \r\n",

      "Changed it to all caps. This entire module is marked as experimental, so we can easily change it later if we want. \n\nWe use all caps for the core data types too. That's a bit late to change now I think, but it would have been a lot more concise if we had used the exact same case as the local names. E.g. CoreDatatype.XSD.gMonthDay instead of CoreDatatype.XSD.GMONTHDAY. Also sometimes we use underscore and sometimes we don't, e.g. NON_POSITIVE_INTEGER but not with NORMALIZEDSTRING. It's inherited from the original XSD vocabulary naming, so at least it's consistent. "

      "Thanks, @erikgb, for approaching this so quickly!\r\nI like your approach, using the JDK where possible and Apache Commons Codec is a good approach for this. As @aschwarte10 mentioned, we might rather target 4.3.0 as this now requires a new (or different) dependency which was not used for this module before.\r\n\r\n@hmottestad @abrokenjester any chance of getting this into a 4.3.0 branch and milestone build rather sooner than later?",
      "> You are currently targeting the `main` branch (i.e. a patch release like 4.2.x). I am not sure whether we can add a new dependency to one of the modules in a patch release. We for instance do resolution of transitive dependencies manually by listing them explicitly (i.e. we do not rely on the modules POM). Maybe it would be better to target the develop branch and go for a 4.3.0 release?\r\n\r\nI see. I am happy to do whatever the maintainers think is best. To avoid the new dependency, it should be pretty straight-forward to write a custom method to do hex-encoding.\r\n\r\n> In addition: did you check that unit test cases exist? At least for `AbstractRDFParser#createNode(String nodeID)` it should be straight forward to create them (to check before / after)\r\n\r\nNo, I did not, but good point. I assumed this piece of code had test coverage. Ideally, tests should be added before this PR. Anything you could contribute? I am not sure how the tests would look like....",

That way you can also track the reason _why_ you're fixing these more easily: presumably it is because you want to upgrade to a version of that library that no longer supports the deprecated pattern.

As far as I can tell the problem is that the join optimizer calculates an initial cost for the `(?child, type, ?type)` pattern that is lower than it should be due to its base cardinality being lower than that of the `(?child, subClassOf, ?parent)` pattern. I'm struggling to see how to accurately compensate here though, to be honest. How can we inform it at the time of cost calculation that `?type` is different from `?parent` because the former is set by a BSA? "

From high level skimming the changes make sense. Regarding whether the queryInfo needs to be closed as well, I would need to double check - can't remember this from the back of my head.\r\n\r\nMay I ask in which scenario you discovered the unclosed connections?

      "> May I ask in which scenario you discovered the unclosed connections? Or was it by going through the code.\r\n\r\nIn the past the AbstractSailConnection used to track all iterations and close them automatically when the connection was closed. I found this to be a bit of a resource hog, so instead I updated it in 4.1.0 to use a Cleaner to close them during GC. Since this doesn't guarantee that iterations are actually closed in a timely manner I've chosen to implement a counter of active iterations and then throw an exception if there are any open iterations when the connection is closed. I then ran into issues when integrating RDF4J 4.1.0-M1 with GraphDB where a test was complaining about my new exception.",

I think this is a good way ahead and I am good to go once this is ready and all tests are passing.\r\n> \r\n> Would it be possible to have another 4.1 Milestone build after this one is merged? Error handling in federation is quite difficult and even subtle changes may cause issues at runtime. With a milestone build we would be able to test this alongside our development and have even more confidence.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks @hmottestad for taking the efforts 👍\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to not have to create another milestone build. It'll still be at least another week before 4.1 is out the door, maybe you can start testing the snapshot build? If you find any critical issues we can push the release date. "

If you add this in main first (which is fine for these kinds of internal tasks), it automatically also gets added to develop when the branches sync, but if you merge to develop first, you'll have to cherrypick it to get it into main also (and in some cases you may have to deal with merge conflicts later on when main and develop sync).

Your code would be simpler and probably safer if you could always assume the prefix map to exist.

I don't know if this is something that we modified ourselves or if it's a change in JavaCC. I haven't put any effort into figuring it out either. \n\nWhen generating the java code there were also a couple of AST* classes that were not generated by JavaCC. That makes me wonder if maybe they were added manually instead. \n\nI also think that I should try to contribute some of the performance optimizations back to JavaCC, that way we don't need so many git patch files. \n\n\n",

We register the iterations with the [Java Cleaner](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html) (introduced in Java 9 as a better alternative to finalize) together with a Runnable that closes the iteration. The Cleaner executes the runnable when the iteration has become phantom reachable (e.g. eligible for GC). We use our existing ConcurrentCleaner which wraps an array of Cleaner instances to spread the load when objects are registered from multiple threads.\r\n\r\nI've retained the tracking functionality for debugging purposes and it can be enabled the same way as we would previously have enabled tracking with stack traces.\r\n\r\nA change for users will be that a connection will now `throw new SailException(\"Connection closed before all iterations were closed.\")` if there are unclosed iterations.

      "So there is a bunch of stuff in this branch now. I'll have to at least split things into separate commits. \n\nComparing performance against the current state of the main branch is pretty cool. With all the performance improvements currently on develop together with the improvements in this branch the overall query performance is often around 2x better and more importantly a bit over 2x for concurrent queries.\n\nI have long intended to create some reusable benchmarks so we can compare the NativeStore, LMDB Store and the MemoryStore. The overhead of disk access will probably reduce the performance impact, but there should still be some improvements. \n\nI also want to post some ShaclSail benchmarks, since the validation typically generates a lot of queries many of which take more time to optimize than to evaluate. \n\n",

Would that make a difference in this case? \n\nOriginally I also wanted to loosen up on some of the source compatibility restrictions for minor releases to allow me to change the super class for the optimizers instead of duplicating and deprecating.

benchmark. That's why there are some benchmarks that seem to be significantly slower. I reran the ones that had gotten slower and they all look pretty much identical to the \"before\" numbers once they run them for more than a few iterations.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR was to improve the QualifiedValueShape benchmarks, which I succeeded in doing. Performance for that benchmark is now in line with the performance in RDF4J 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                      Score (before)    Score (after)   Units\r\nQualifiedValueShapeBenchmarkEmpty.shacl             14618.53           7758.16   ms/op\r\n```"

On my home machine I have a benchmark run with great results, but that is with the enabling of the lazy mapdb mode. On the other hand the sync setting is not passed on so we always use an in memory hashmap. Quite a lot to still to be fixed. Especially around the setup of these collection factories. ",

The benefit of these is that you can enable various levels of tracking, logging and automatic unlocking if the lock gets garbage collected. ",
      "@hmottestad The lock is a StampedLock and it existed already in the last version. Let me know if the other locks are faster. In this case we could simply switch to another implementation.\r\n\r\nThe lock is only required for autogrow to stop any read and write transactions while changing the map size.",

      "The ReadPrefReadWriteLockManager is faster than a plain stamped lock, but there is a small overhead because of the lock object. It uses a combination of a StampedLock and two LongAdders to achieve faster read locks than just using the StampedLock. I also intend to switch it over to using a boolean and VarHandle instead.\n\nThe biggest reason to use the lock managers is that they make debugging locking bugs easier because they can be configured to detect abandoned locks and also possible deadlocks. \n\nWe use these for transaction management and iterators that are user facing. So that if a user forgets to close the iterator for a query result then the lock is automatically released when it becomes phantom reachable. \n\n\n\n\n",
      "The current implementation uses only one lock instance for the whole triple store. The lock itself is acquired while fetching data within the iterators next() method and is released immediately afterwards. Therefore it cannot happen that the user forgets to free the lock. I am unsure if it is really helpful to use ReadPrefReadWriteLockManager in this case as the locks are very short-lived and also guaranteed to be freed.",

I don't think it will, but it's hard to be sure.\r\n\r\nThe problem might be that a partially applied transaction cannot be rolled back when the record cache (some kind of WAL) is missing.",
      "I can't see that it ever gets read back in again. \n\nThe WAL seems to based on editing the B-tree and adding a flag to denote that a statement was removed or added. And then during commit the status file is updated to \"committing\" and each statement that is flagged for removal is removed and those flagged as added statements just have their flag cleared. \n\nDuring recovery the transaction status file is read and if it's in  the commit phase then it just resumes iterating over the statements and doing what the flag says. If it's not in the commit phase then it assumes that no action has been taken based on the flags and essentially just resets  them. \n\nThe recovery mechanism just calls the commit and rollback methods. The updatedTriplesCache is used to track which statements have been updated during the transaction, so that commit and rollback only need to iterate over affected statements instead of all the statements. When the recovery mechanism invokes the commit and rollback methods there isn't an updatedTriplesCache so it instead needs to iterate over all the statements in the indexes. \n\nIt looks like the updatedTriplesCache is kept in a specific file, but I can't see how it is used during recovery and it makes me wonder if it too could be  kept in memory.

If the variable is not null, then we can safely use. If it is null then it could either be uninitialized or a stale read. So then I do a volatile read to be sure it's not stale, and then if it's still null I initialize the variable using compare and set.\n\nI don't think I'll keep this code. It's a bit overkill and I don't really need to lazily initialize the variable. I might pick it up again somewhere else where locking or synchronization adds a lot of overhead. \n\nCan I propose using volatile and double checked locking for your code?

Could it be targeted at 4.1.0? Or maybe deprecate some stuff now so that it's easier to remove in 5.0.0?\n\nI've got a lot of breaking changes in my performance branch, so I'm fairly eager to work towards 5.0.0 sooner rather than later. ",
      "It's package reshuffling, so kind of a pain to do in a minor release (you'd have to introduce deprecated duplicates of the moved classes in the old location, which is annoying when using code completion), but not impossible. But my main thing is really that I'm not convinced this refactor really gains us anything. The basic idea (have all parser-specific stuff in that parser's package/module instead of in the generic rio api module) is sound enough but it ignores the fact that a lot of this is still shared between multiple parser implementations.\r\n\r\nAnd you're right: it's rather close to release. Perhaps it's better to just park this for now, then do a more comprehensive reorg (including some of the shared stuff) later, for 5.0. "

Pretty sure it is, but never hurts to double-check.",
      "@jeenbroekstra the parsing works good (which is what we are expecting with this change)\r\n\r\nThe query renderer in `org.eclipse.rdf4j.queryrender.sparql.experimental.SparqlQueryRenderer.SparqlQueryRenderer()` however seems to produce a slightly different query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFILTER (!EXISTS {\t?s <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> ?o . } ) \r\nBIND (<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean>(?o)  AS ?o2) . \r\n }\r\n GROUP BY ?s ?o ?o2\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. it moves the function call as a BIND into the WHERE clause\r\n\r\nI think this should be fine though (and if at all it is orthogonal to this fix)"

In the mean time, we need to put reliability over performance and merge this as a short term fix.\r\n> \r\n> Just wondering if maybe there is some underlying issue that is causing collisions to be more frequent?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, most likely. I suspect that it has to do with how we calculate combined hashes. I _think_ we're following the letter of the algorithm as outlined in the technical paper there, but perhaps I've missed something. Certainly, in theory 128 bits should be enough to not cause collisions in graphs of this size (or any practical size, really). Yet clearly we do get a collision of sorts, and clearly using a larger hash size mitigates the issue. Perhaps there's an overflow in the hash combination algorithm that makes it collapse to a smaller value space? The trouble is that I can't quite put my finger on it, and I've not been able to reduce the example - as soon as I take even a few triples out the isomorphism consistently succeeds.\r\n ",

      "@jeenbroekstra and @barthanssens this PR is massive and I don't expect you to read through everything. I've made some comments to highlight some of the changes that might be worth looking at. In the beginning I created support for allowing shapes to be stored in any graph, then later I added a config option where the graphs have to be listed. During this time I found out that I would run out of memory with some of my multithreaded stress tests that used SERIALIZABLE isolation. This led me to optimize the ChangeSet implementation and fix some bugs where change sets where closed too early or not closed at all. This could be extracted into it's own PR with it's own issue if you guys think it's strictly necessary.",
      "Thanks @hmottestad , looks impressive. I'll try and review in a bit more depth this weekend. Don't know yet if you should break into separate PRs, but it would be good if you could at least clean up the commit history a bit.",
      "My browser crashes when trying to open the \"Files changed\" view. I can't verify, but I suspect that a large part of why this touches so many files is that you made fixes in cross-cutting concerns like the locking and ChangeSet implementations.

      "I got curious about LMDB because of this implementation, and it seems client-side caching is not required because lookups are so fast. If you don't mind me asking: Is the value cache really needed? It could actually slow things down or become a bottleneck due to locking...\r\n\r\nFor example, https://github.com/lmdbjava/lmdbjava states as one important advantage of LMDB: \"Freedom from application-side data caching (memory-mapped files are more efficient)\". ",
      "@fkleedorfer This is an interesting question and not easy to answer.\r\nLMDB is fast if the relevant pages can be kept in memory which is the case when your db's size is not very larger than the available RAM size.\r\nFurthermore, when searching for a value the RDF4J LMDB store first needs to convert it to a byte array and then uses this byte array as key for the lookup.\r\nThis conversion involves memory allocations and multiple operations for translating the data. Due to the B+-Tree the lookup within LMDB also has the complexity of log(n).\r\nI also think that locking may not be an issue because the caches are using ConcurrentHashMap that relies on multiple locks (> 16) for different hash segments.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it may be worth to test the performance of the LMDB store without caching to finally answer your question."

No, it is just a temporary set used within ONE transaction.\r\n2. They don't get GCed. But as unusedIds is only temporary this should not matter here at all.\r\n3.

But I also read that someone has managed to corrupt the underlying LMDB of the Monero blockchain...\r\n   Maybe it would be good to use some threshold here and sync from time to time to disk as it is done by the MapDB-backed set.

The transactions are completely serialized.",

      "Benchmarking locking is really hard. I've tried to create some benchmarks that combine various locking/releasing patterns back to back. The best benchmarks are those that do real world things and measure just the overhead that locking adds, but those are hard to create. In the SHACL benchmarks we have `ComplexLargeBenchmark.noPreloadingNonEmptyParallel` which is a decent benchmark that shows some of this overhead, but I don't know how to isolate the overhead other than to profile the running code. So that leaves us with the benchmarks I've created here for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nReadWriteLockManagerBenchmark.mixed                      avgt    5  4.820 ± 0.548  ms/op\r\nReadWriteLockManagerBenchmark.mixedReadHeavy             avgt    5  4.566 ± 0.011  ms/op\r\nReadWriteLockManagerBenchmark.onlyReadLocksNoContention  avgt    5  4.425 ± 0.021  ms/op\r\nReadWriteLockManagerBenchmark.onlyWriteLocks             avgt    5  1.814 ± 0.052  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nReadWriteLockManagerBenchmark.mixed                      avgt   10  0.614 ± 0.026  ms/op\r\nReadWriteLockManagerBenchmark.mixedReadHeavy             avgt   10  0.535 ± 0.041  ms/op\r\nReadWriteLockManagerBenchmark.onlyReadLocksNoContention  avgt   10  1.709 ± 0.034  ms/op\r\nReadWriteLockManagerBenchmark.onlyWriteLocks             avgt   10  0.112 ± 0.002  ms/op\r\n```",
      "Since the WeakObjectRegistry now supports concurrent reads (and writes for that matter) we can now better see the overhead that the old LockManager code was causing. The new locks don't implement all the tracking that the old locks had, so it's not apples to apples at the moment, but the difference in performance is quite stark with more than a 2x improvement with a mixed read-only query load.\r\n\r\n## Before\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                             Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nParallelQueryBenchmark.mixedWorkload  avgt    3  398.387 ± 89.162  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n## After\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                             Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nParallelQueryBenchmark.mixedWorkload  avgt    3  151.281 ± 21.076  ms/op\r\n```\r\n",
      "@jeenbroekstra So I've still got some tests to figure out. Essentially just an issue with differences in performance of my machine vs the CI server. Might move those tests into a benchmark or something instead. \n\nPerformance in general though is much improved with this new way of locking. I've still got some work to do on updating all the java docs and comments, but it would be great if you could take another look at this and maybe give it a try on your own machine if you have a chance. ",
      "It's a bit tricky to get the right balance of read priority vs write priority. ",
      "All the tests are passing now and I'm generally happy with the code.  I've also fixed a bunch of the java docs and updated the copy right headers and authors where I've essentially replaced the all the code. \n\nWould be nice to have some mixed read/write benchmarks to check that kind of performance too. At the moment I've just done benchmarks directly on the overhead of the locks and on concurrent read operations against the MemoryStore. \n\nTODO\n- [x]  clean up commits by moving benchmarks to a single commit at the start of the branch, squash the rest of the commits \n\n",

For each phase of the query evaluation we attempt to resolve all \"constants for the life time of the query\" and use them in java lamba's to do the actual evaluation.\r\n\r\nIt does so by introducing query evaluation steps. These are constructed once for the query and do the actual evaluation.\r\nThis logic allows us to reuse objects like lamba's which are relatively expensive to construct per invocation but should only be created once per query evaluation. For example we can now construct a near space optimal ArrayBindingSet, where we use lamba's to change lookups into direct index based array accesses.\r\n\r\nThis is the foundational feature with more improvements coming after it.\r\n\r\n----\r\nPR Author Checklist (see the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details):\r\n\r\n - [x] my pull request is [self-contained](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/merge-strategy/#self-contained-changes-pull-requests-and-commits)\r\n - [x] I've added tests for the changes I made\r\n - [x] I've applied [code formatting](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting) (you can use `mvn process-resources` to format from the command line)\r\n - [x] I've [squashed](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/squashing) my commits where necessary \r\n - [x] every commit message starts with the issue number (GH-xxxx) followed by a meaningful description of the change\r\n\r\n",

This `StatementPatternIteration` implements the interface `QueryEvaluationStep`. A lot of work\r\nthat is otherwise evaluated per invocation of evaluate is now done in the constructor. For example determining if the query needs to look into the Sparql Dataset can be done once instead of at each invocation. I also used this for effect in two join operators.\r\n\r\nThis allows for performance improvements.

Before we have\r\nseen situations where there were resource leaks and blocked threads.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n\r\n* ParallleTaskBase has now performTaskInternal to remember the reference\r\nto the closable iteration. Upon cancel() the closable iteration is also\r\nclosed. Subclasses of ParallelTaskBase now override performTaskInternal\r\n* Scheduler classes that make use of a phaser (e.g.\r\nControlledWorkerJoin) now explicitly force termination of the phaser\r\nupon close. This potentially unblocks running threads\r\n* Close dependent connection now also handles unexpected error cases\r\n(e.g. interrupts)\r\n* Generally more safe-guards are added and inner iterations are closed\r\nas early as possible\r\n\r\nNote: MediumConcurrencyTest now has a helper method for executing queries partially. If this is used, the canceling case can be simulated due to partial consumption of query results.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPR Author Checklist (see the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details):\r\n\r\n - [x] my pull request is [self-contained](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/merge-strategy/#self-contained-changes-pull-requests-and-commits)\r\n - [x] I've added tests for the changes I made\r\n - [x] I've applied [code formatting](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting) (you can use `mvn process-resources` to format from the command line)\r\n - [x] I've [squashed](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/squashing) my commits where necessary \r\n - [x] every commit message starts with the issue number (GH-xxxx) followed by a meaningful description of the change\r\n\r\n",

We also add some code that simplifies nested unions, which also makes it easier to deduplicate. Deduplication makes sh:or faster since we can reduce the number of plan nodes used to calculate the relevant targets for a transaction. #3088 \r\n - Related to #3088 is performance or sh:or during bulk validation. The problem boils down to skipping the target extension phase by being able to detect when we are using bulk validation and retrieving all the targets directly. We introduce a new plan node to signal bulk validation and also add some support for filtering data earlier. #3098 \r\n - Similar to the simplification of nested unions, we can also simplify nested Unique (distinct) plan nodes #3099\r\n - The new XSD enum support allows us to optimise the DatatypeFilter plan node #3100 \r\n - The ListBindingSet mints a new hash set every time the getBindingNames method is called, this is now cached on the first call. #3097 \r\n - Even with the optimisations in #3097 it was still better to be able to provide the binding names as a set, so we introduced a new binding set with this support (in the ShaclSail code base) #3101 \r\n<!-- short description of your change goes here -->\r\n\r\n----\r\nPR Author Checklist (see the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details):\r\n\r\n - [ ] my pull request is [self-contained](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/merge-strategy/#self-contained-changes-pull-requests-and-commits)\r\n - [x] I've added tests for the changes I made\r\n - [x] I've applied [code formatting](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting) (you can use `mvn process-resources` to format from the command line)\r\n - [x] I've [squashed](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/squashing) my commits where necessary \r\n - [x] every commit message starts with the issue number (GH-xxxx) followed by a meaningful description of the change\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "GitHub issue resolved: #2727  <!-- add a Github issue number here, e.g #123. -->\r\n\r\nBriefly describe the changes proposed in this PR:\r\n\r\n- refactor of property path processing to a cleaner tree-visitor approach instead of a massive if-else. \r\n- simplified path modifier processing code (old code was still written for {min,max} syntax which is no longer supported)\r\n- added regression test for GH-2727\r\n\r\nTo explain the main ideas behind the refactor:\r\n\r\nA SPARQL path expression is parsed into an AST tree structure. Each path expression is a PathAlternative, consisting of one more PathSequences. Each PathSequence, in turn, consists of one or more PathElements. PathElements have optional modifiers (?, + and *), and can be either negated or inverted (or both). Note that a PathElement itself can be a nested path expression again.\r\n\r\nIn the previous code, the entire path expression processing was handled in a single visitor method, the `visit(PathSequence)`.  It kept internal state, manually inspected its child elements (instead of letting the visitor pattern handle it), and was generally a mess of if-else conditions and special-case handling. What it also did was manipulate the global GraphPattern field directly, instead of just returning the produced TupleExpr. \r\n\r\nThe refactor splits this out, so that processing logic is more local to the specific element: path sequences deal with introducing intermediate variables, keeping the context of what the \"current\" start and end variables of the sequence are. The details of processing each element of the path are now in `visit(PathElt)`. This checks if the element is nested (and if so defers back to the visitor to handle the nested expression), or negated, or inverse. It also handles all path modifiers. \r\n\r\nThe handling of path modifiers has also been significantly changed. Previously it had convoluted logic that dealt with building up a tree of Unions to handle things like \"at least 2, at most 5\". This was introduced when SPARQL was still in draft and had this `{min, max}` syntax for path expressions. I removed this because the logic was hard to follow, essentially unused, and produced buggy behavior in several cases. \r\n\r\n----\r\nPR Author Checklist (see the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details):\r\n\r\n - [x] my pull request is [self-contained](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/merge-strategy/#self-contained-changes-pull-requests-and-commits)\r\n - [x] I've added tests for the changes I made\r\n - [x] I've applied [code formatting](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting) (you can use `mvn process-resources` to format from the command line)\r\n - [ ] I've [squashed](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/squashing) my commits down to one or a few meaningful commits\r\n - [x] every commit message starts with the issue number (GH-xxxx) followed by a meaningful description of the change\r\n - [x] every commit has been [signed off](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1962094/what-is-the-sign-off-feature-in-git-for)\r\n\r\n",

This allows easier code at the client end, e.g. instead of \r\n\r\n```java\r\n   import org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.impl.SimpleValueFactory;\r\n\r\n   IRI example =    SimpleValueFactory.getInstance().createIRI(\"http://www.example.org/\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can now do \r\n\r\n```java\r\n   import org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.util.Values;\r\n\r\n   IRI example =    Values.iri(\"http://www.example.org/\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   import static org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.util.Values.iri;\r\n\r\n   IRI example =  iri(\"http://www.example.org/\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The utility methods are deliberately quite strict about checking syntactic validity of input arguments (including checks for nulls). \r\n\r\n- Migrated several existing static methods from `Statements` and `Literals` into `Values` for consistency, marked existing methods deprecated.\r\n\r\n- Updated documentation for Model API and Repository API, as well as (part of) the Tutorial\r\n- As a side effect / cleanup thing, made the examples directory a proper maven module so we can more easily keep it up to date (and extend the set of code examples as well) \r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPR Author Checklist (see the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details):\r\n\r\n - [x] my pull request is [self-contained](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/merge-strategy/#self-contained-changes-pull-requests-and-commits)\r\n - [x] I've added tests for the changes I made\r\n - [x] I've applied [code formatting](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting) (you can use `mvn process-resources` to format from the command line)\r\n - [x] I've [squashed](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/squashing) my commits down to one or a few meaningful commits\r\n - [x] every commit message starts with the issue number (GH-xxxx) followed by a meaningful description of the change\r\n - [x] every commit has been [signed off](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1962094/what-is-the-sign-off-feature-in-git-for)\r\n\r\n",

A downside is that if a client receives this config, changes some other property but forgets to re-assert the correct password, the stored password will be overwritten. \r\n\r\nPossible fix for that is to explicitly scan for the password mask when receiving an updated config, and ignoring that property if it is set to the mask value. \r\n\r\n(all of this under the caveat that we do not pretend that RDF4J server is particularly secure when basic http auth is used) \r\n\r\n---- \r\nPR Author Checklist (see the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details):\r\n\r\n - [ ] my pull request is [self-contained](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/developer/merge-strategy/#self-contained-changes-pull-requests-and-commits)\r\n - [ ] I've added tests for the changes I made\r\n - [ ] I've applied [code formatting](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting) (you can use `mvn process-resources` to format from the command line)\r\n - [ ] every commit message starts with the issue number (GH-xxxx) followed by a meaningful description of the change\r\n - [ ] every commit has been [signed off](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1962094/what-is-the-sign-off-feature-in-git-for)\r\n\r\nNote: we merge all feature pull requests using [squash and merge](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-merge-methods-on-github#squashing-your-merge-commits).

Use-cases include injection of\r\nthread-local context variables, or more fine-granular error handling.\r\n\r\nAll sub-queries sent by the federation engine that make use of the\r\nconcurrency infrastructure (e.g. ControlledWorkerScheduler) are passing\r\nthis wrapper.\r\n\r\nThe concrete implementation can be configured using\r\nFedXConfig.withTaskWrapper(TaskWrapper).\r\n\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andreas Schwarte <aschwarte10@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* GH-2366: address review feedback + configurability for FedX repo factory\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andreas Schwarte <aschwarte10@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* GH-2366: refine interface definition\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andreas Schwarte <aschwarte10@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* GH-2366: formatting\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andreas Schwarte <aschwarte10@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n* GH-2366: minor editorial call change\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andreas Schwarte <aschwarte10@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Andreas Schwarte <aschwarte10@gmail.com>"

The setting is ignored by writers that support RDF* natively.\r\n  * Such special IRIs are converted back to triples on parsing.

It is respected by all parsers including those with native RDF* support.\r\n* RDF* support for tuple query results\r\n  * Binary query results supports it out of the box without introducing a new format, much like the binary RDF format.\r\n  * Introduced SPARQL* JSON format based on SPARQL JSON (see `SPARQLStarResultsJSONConstants` for example of triple serialization).\r\n  * Introduced SPARQL* TSV format based on SPARQL TSV. Triples are serialized in their N-Triples form (much like all other values in TSV).\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n* Added another MIME type for Turtle* to better reflect its Turtle origin\r\n* Parser/writer (both RDF and query result) cleanup and contract enforcement, improved tests\r\n  * `AbstractRDFWriter` defines a new abstract protected method `handleStatementImpl` that implementing classes must override instead of `handleStatement`.\r\n  * The sequence `startRDF()` ... `handleXXX()` ... `endRDF()` is now enforced strictly (there were some cases where `handleXXX()` was called before `startRDF()`.\r\n  * `AbstractQueryResultWriter` defines a new abstract protected method `handleSolutionImpl` that implementing classes must override instead of `handleSolution`.\r\n* NTriplesUtil moved outside NTriples module (similar to some other NTriples related classes used in multiple places)\r\n",

My idea was minimal disruptive changes and yet a natural view of RDF* data.\r\n\r\nIt also adds parsers and writers for Turtle* and TriG*. Turtle* extends Turtle to allow for RDF* triples and is the only format mentioned in the RDF* definition document. TriG* extends TriG in a similar manner to allow for RDF* and named graphs.\r\n\r\n## Changes in the basic model\r\n\r\nRDF* extends RDF by allowing _triples_ in the subject and object position. This can be achieved by:\r\n* Adding a new type of ~~Value~~ Resource called Triple\r\n  - Triple has a Resource subject, IRI predicate and Value object.\r\n* ~~Adding a new type of Value called SubjectValue (essentially this could be called NonLiteral too)~~\r\n   - ~~Triple extends SubjectValue~~\r\n   - ~~Resource extends SubjectValue~~\r\n* ~~Statement's subject's type changes from Resource to SubjectValue~~\r\n\r\nNote that Triple is quite different from Statement. A Triple never has a context and it is a ~~Value~~ Resource.\r\n\r\n## ~~Changes in some APIs~~\r\n\r\n~~All API methods that take a Statement provided by its constituent objects (Resource subject, IRI predicate, Value object, Resource... context) change their subject argument to SubjectValue: SubjectValue subject, IRI predicate, Value object, Resource... context.~~\r\n\r\n~~All API methods that return a subject change their return type from Resource to SubjectValue.~~\r\n\r\n## ~~Existing RDF-only code~~\r\n\r\n~~A lot of the existing code expects subjects to be a Resource so I've added SubjectValue.asResource() which will cast its argument to a Resource if it is indeed a Resource. If it's not a Resource (then it must be a Triple) it will throw an exception about trying to handle RDF* data from within an RDF context. This allows existing code to stay RDF-only as long as needed.~~\r\n\r\n## ~~Notes on tests~~\r\n\r\n~~All unit tests (mvn clean install) passed.~~\r\n~~LocalRepositoryManagerTest relies on rdf4j 2.5.2 to satisfy a circular dependency and since the API changed it no longer works. I was able to run it locally by substituting 2.5.2 with a local bootstrap version.~~",

As\r\nthis was not the default, it was not yet discovered. The reason was that\r\nHTTP slots in the background tuple results were not processed in a\r\nsuitable order.\r\n\r\nAs of this change we slightly adopted the evaluation logics: now we\r\nbasically consume the background tuple result and keep it in memory for\r\nupcoming operators, thus process it in order.\r\n\r\nAlso the Bound Join evaluation is now activated by default.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a slight follow up of #1802 is added: the boundJoinBlockSize\r\nis no longer hard-coded in the RepositoryFederatedService, but now uses\r\nthe value from the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways evaluate query in FedX if it contains SERVICE\r\n\r\nIf a query contains a SERVICE clause, it is now always evaluated in the\r\nFedX engine (even if the federation onyl has a single member)\r\n",

But I want to go slow and give our users time to react to this change - there may be legit use cases for direct use of the AST out there that we may still need to accomodate somehow.  I'm also still on the fence over whether it's even a good idea to make this package internal completely. \r\n\r\nIf we agree that this is a good general way to handle the API clarification issue, we can go ahead and do this for as many relevant classes and packages as possible before the 3.0 release. \r\n\r\n",

The longer we wait, the more awkward this becomes.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the new code formatting.

    "body": "Models can only be modified when exactly one thread is accessing it, but can be accessed by multiple threads when no changes are made. The Changesets use Models to store the delta against the finalized state. These are modified by a connection (in a single thread) and when the connection is committed, but not yet finalized (due to other open connections), the changesets are shared among other connections that need access to these changes (via a SailSourceBranch). With large non-finalized changes against the NativeRdfStore a SailSourceModel is used (backed by another nativerdf store). Unlike other in-memory Models, the SailSourceModel delays sink modifications until they are needed. In the event when a nativerdf connection makes bulk changes, but does not do any read operations before commit, the SailSourceModel may have outstanding sink operations that still need to be flushed when it is made available to other connections via a branch. The next connection that does any read operations may force a SailSourceModel to flush and if it two or more connections try to read the non-finalized changes at the same time, a race condition may occur if the SailSourceModel is not correctly synchronized. This PR synchronizes this process so only one connection will trigger the SailSourceModel to flush.\r\n\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: James Leigh <james.leigh@ontotext.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses GitHub issue: #774",

Parser will now block (ie, wait) on their respective handle methods until the queue has the capacity to allow it to go further.\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses part of #738, in that the internal push-based parsing now has an easy to use push-back mechanism to rate-limit and (almost) short-circuit the parsing based on the consumer. In reality, the capacity of the BlockingQueue used imposes a limit on the amount of short-circuiting in play. In this iteration, the capacity is fixed at 1, but QueueCursor has options for various other limits that users can experiment with themselves if 1 doesn't work for them. In the future we can extend the API to customise the capacity or change the default.\r\n\r\nIn terms of paging that was referred to in #738, the functionality already exists in the form of QueryResults.limitResults, which can be chained with the result of QueryResults.parseGraphBackground or QueryResultIO.parseTupleBackground.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for the slightly odd placement of the helper methods relates to the current sub-optimal module layout, where rdf4j-rio-api is a dependency of rdf4j-query and rdf4j-query is a dependency of rdf4j-queryresultio-api.\r\n\r\nIn the QueueCursor case, rdf4j-query is a much better module in terms of dependencies compared to rdf4j-http-client, which should make it slightly more accessible for reuse.\r\n\r\nIn this iteration, ForkJoinPool.commonPool() is used to enable users to configure the maximum number of concurrent threads across calls to the parseGraphBackground/parseTupleBackground methods without having to add a dedicated ExecutorService to rdf4j-query.",

Not clear why the input streams are being closed twice, but the core reason is that HTTPClient is not attempting to be threadsafe and is using a set-to-null pattern that will always be vulnerable to issues without threadsafety wrappers\n- Move almost all internal CloseableIteration implementations to subclasses of AbstractCloseableIteration to standardise the way closure occurs and attempt to prevent multiple calls to close getting anywhere near HTTPClient in future from our control\n- Standardise on the handleClose pattern using try-finally to ensure all resource closures occur properly\n- Add proactive calls to AbstractCloseableIteration.isClosed to exit earlier in cases where we have already called close on objects\n- Adds active closure just before hasNext is about to return false or next is about to throw NoSuchElementException. This has been rebutted with anecdotal arguments in the past, but unless a minimal test case fails due to the changes then I will still be pushing for active closure on exhaustion. The main reason for pushing for it is that the behaviour looks correct. Ie, after-close behaviour is that hasNext returns false and next throws NoSuchElementException the same as just before the close-on-exhaust occurs.\n\nMake sure you've followed the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). In particular (please tick to indicate you've taken care of it):\n- [x] RDF4J code formatting has been applied\n- [x] tests are included\n- [x] all tests succeed\n\nThe volatile closed variable requires double-checked locking to properly operate.\n\nIn particular, we are required by non-threadsafe Apache HTTPClient implementations to not call close multiple times in close succession.\n\nIe, they don't fully comply with the standard java.io.Closeable.close contract but try to release their obligation by declaring their implementations as \"NotThreadSafe\".\n\nThe underlying issue is possibly that the InputStream is having .close called on it directly from another location (thread/connection-pooling cleanup inside of HttpClient is the most likely place), but volatile variables require double-checked locking to operate safely, so there are no downsides to this change, even though I can't see how handleClose could be called twice given the use of AtomicBoolean.compareAndSet to isolate them, assuming there are no bugs with AtomicBoolean.compareAndSet...\n\nThe vast majority of classes with close methods have been audited and their implementations fixed so that all components of the close operations are attempted in a threadsafe manner as far as practical.\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Ansell p_ansell@yahoo.com\n",

This is caused by an unsuitable join order,\nwhere the sub select is processed using the results of a graph pattern\nas intermediate result.\n\nThe simplest fix for this case is to set the cardinality hints for the\noptimizer for SLICE algebra nodes to 1 such that they are executed as\nleft join argument with high probability.\n\nThe full fix (which will be done in another change) could be to use a hash\nbased join strategy.\n",
