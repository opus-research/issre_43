Pytest-asyncio currently assumes that async fixture scope is correlated with the new event loop scope. This prevents fixtures from being evaluated independently from the event loop scope and breaks some existing test suites (see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/706\">#706</a>). For example, a test suite may require all fixtures and tests to run in the same event loop, but have async fixtures that are set up and torn down for each module.

If you wrap an async function in it, `monitor` will only wrap the creation of the coroutine, rather than its execution, which means it'll exit early. It won't capture the actual duration of the execution of the function, and the cron run will always be reported as success.\r\n\r\nTo better illustrate, try this out:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport asyncio\r\nimport sentry_sdk\r\n\r\nsentry_sdk.init(...)\r\n\r\n@sentry_sdk.monitor(monitor_slug='my-slug')\r\nasync def my_cron():\r\n    print('running...')\r\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)\r\n    raise ValueError\r\n\r\nasyncio.run(my_cron())\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you execute this, you'll see multiple fishy things:\r\n* the cron will be green even though it throws an exception\r\n* even if it takes >= 1s to execute, the time reported will be ~0ms\r\n* the \"running...\" message will be printed _after_ the final checkin (you can see this with `debug=True`)\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we need special handling for the async case where we actually execute the coroutine and wait until it's finished before reporting.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Notes\r\n\r\nThis is annoying to implement cleanly because of Python 2 compatibility. Python 2 will throw `SyntaxErrors` when it encounters any `async def`s. We could use an `exec` for the async part, but this is ugly.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'm implementing the Python2+3-friendly part of the decorator in the main `monitor` class and outsourcing the problematic `__call__` definition to version-specific mixins, where the Python 3-only mixin will never get imported on Python 2.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we can get rid of this compat hack with SDK 2.0.",

You should be able, however, to use the type hint in your code by importing `Event` from within an `if TYPE_CHECKING` block, and then enclosing the type in quotes, like so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING\r\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\r\n    from sentry_sdk.typing import Event\r\n\r\ndef before_send(event: \"Event\", _: dict[str, Any]) -> \"Event\":\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Looks like a breaking change.\r\n\r\nI understand your frustration, and while I certainly believe we made a mistake by using a private type on publicly exposed functions, our reasoning with this change is that it is not breaking because it only affects type hints, which are not evaluated at runtime and not enforced by the Python language. The code is fully backwards-compatible at runtime, and the runtime public API has remained the same as previously – any code written before this change will continue to work the same now after the change.

The type can be defined unconditionally, but imported inside `if TYPE_CHECKING` block. This way it won't break in old Python versions, because module is not imported.\r\n\r\nOk, anyway we have to find some workaround.",

    "body": "## tl;dr\r\n\r\nWhen generating the `filename` attribute for stack trace frames, the SDK uses the `filename_for_module` function. When generating the `code.filepath` attribute for query spans, the SDK does _not_ use that function. Because of this inconsistency, code mappings that work with stack frames sometimes don't work with queries that come from the same files.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure that query sources use `filename_for_module`, so the paths are consistent.\r\n\r\n## `filename_for_module`\r\n\r\nThe `filename_for_module` function, roughly, does this:\r\n\r\n- accepts a module (e.g., `\"sentry.api.serializers.base\"`) and a full file path (e.g., `\"/opt/software/sentry/src/sentry/api/serializers/base.py\"`)\r\n- finds the \"base\" module (in this case, `\"sentry\"`)\r\n- looks up the base `\"sentry\"` module in `sys.modules`\r\n- fetches the path of the base module (in this case `\"/opt/software/sentry/src/sentry/__init__.py\"`), and strips the last two segments (in this case, `\"/opt/software/sentry/src/\")\r\n- removes that path from the filename (in this case, it would return `\"sentry/api/serializers/base.py\"`)\r\n\r\nThis has a similar effect to stripping the `project_root` but _even better_.\r\n\r\n## Testing `filename_for_module`\r\n\r\n`filename_for_module` only starts to differ from regular behaviour if a module is manually added to `sys.path`. For example, the Sentry codebase likes to import Sentry modules like `from sentry.x import y`, rather than relative paths. This is possible because `sentry` is added to the module path. In these cases, Python will report the frame's module (`frame.f_globals.get(\"__name__\")`) as `sentry.x` since that's how it was imported.\r\n\r\nIn order to test this behaviour, I added a small helper module to each relevant integration, and added it to `sys.path` manually, so it can be referenced without using relative paths.\r\n\r\nN.B. Python 2 has different behaviour! Even for modules that are added to `sys.path` and imported by name, it _still_ reports the frame's module by it's _full path_, so `filename_for_module` can't remove the extra prefixed path segments. IMO this is fine since it degrades gracefully. The module stripping behaviour is more of an enhancement, since it's possible to work around it with code mappings.\r\n\r\n## `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES`\r\n\r\nWithout this line, a lot of the forked tests don't run on macOS at all. Apparently this is a safe thing to ignore most of the time, but you tell me!\r\n\r\n## Product Context\r\n\r\nWe're seeing an issue in Sentry where query source file paths aren't matched to GitHub URLs because the path prefixes are different from the prefixes generated for stack traces for the same files.\r\n\r\ne.g., in `getsentry/sentry` good path is like `sentry/api/serializers/base.py`, but query sources for that file have the file path `sentry/src/sentry/api/serializers/base.py`:  we're adding an extra `sentry/src` prefix to the path. The existing GitHub file path mappings don't work, and there's no \"Open in GitHub\" link as a result.\r\n\r\nIt _is_ possible to set up more code mappings to resolve this, but I think the inconsistency is worth fixing.\r\n",

      "Heyy @gggritso 👋🏻 The change and the reasoning make sense to me.\r\n\r\nAs for testing this: we usually try to make sure each change is covered by a test. In this case there are already testcases for query source in the three different integrations where we support it, so ideally this should just be a matter of taking an existing testcase, copying it and modifying it slightly to trigger behavior similar to what you're seeing in Sentry.\r\n\r\nI think these specific test cases could be repurposed easily:\r\n* https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/c77a1235f4d4f4d88129c13fa9586840ede48ce4/tests/integrations/django/test_db_query_data.py#L120 for Django\r\n* https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/c77a1235f4d4f4d88129c13fa9586840ede48ce4/tests/integrations/sqlalchemy/test_sqlalchemy.py#L392 for SQLAlchemy\r\n* https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/c77a1235f4d4f4d88129c13fa9586840ede48ce4/tests/integrations/asyncpg/test_asyncpg.py#L549 for asyncpg\r\n\r\nYou'll probably need to add some custom `project_root` to the `sentry_init` and then check that `data.get(SPANDATA.CODE_FILEPATH)` looks the way it should.\r\n\r\nAs for Python 2 support, at this stage we still support it 100%, so ideally after this change you'd get the same filepath regardless of Python version. Verifying this locally is a bit tricky because you need some `pyenv`-like multiple py version setup, but the CI will run all tests suites in Python 2 as well, so as long as you write the new tests cases and they pass the CI, that should be enough to verify that it works in py2 too.",
      "@sentrivana thanks for the hints! I added a unit test for each of the three integrations you mentioned. It was a little complicated, so I updated the PR description to explain everything that's going on (it wasn't a `project_root` thing, it was more of a module import thing).\r\n\r\nAs for Python 2, I'm not sure I can get it to work perfectly. More in the PR, but the behaviour there is different enough that it doesn't really work. You tell me, but since this is an _improvement_ to a feature (Python 2 still has a good graceful fallback!) and I'm not breaking anything existing, it might be worth just merging.\r\n\r\nP.S. Do you know how long Sentry will keep supporting Python 2?",
      "Regarding 2.7 support -- we're actually working on a [new major](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2662) for the SDK where we drop 2.7 support. So coming soon! The target date is end of February.",
      "@sentrivana I added some comments to explain why the `sys.path` editing is there, let me know if you want me to add more, plus a docstring to the tests\r\n\r\nAs for the dir/namespace, I'm a little stuck there. I'd _like_ to rename `sqlalchemy_helpers` to `helpers`, but if the helper directories in `asyncpg`, `sqlalchemy` and `django` are all called `helpers` there will be a conflict at import time, no?\r\n\r\nI thought about it for a while, and tried to re-do the tests so they only edit `sys.path` for the one test, but I couldn't figure out how to do it for Django. There, the app is created as a fixture, so the routes are only imported once. I need a way to change the module search path, import a different URL config, create an app with this different config, run tests, and then clean up the module search path. I couldn't figure out a clean way of doing it. What do you think?",
      "@gggritso I see -- I think in that case it's ok to leave the `*_helpers` dirs as is. There's probably a way around it but I also don't have any ideas atm. Feel free to merge :shipit: (You might need to click the `Update branch` button before you can do that though.)"

      "> I just ran the tests locally and there is no error. Just the `tests/integrations/django/asgi/test_asgi.py` tests in the Django test suite freeze and thus the test suite times out. So something with async stuff is off.\r\n\r\nYeah this. Also works for me locally. Interestingly, it only fails on 3.12, but it's not some dependency issue because it installs the same versions of the same dependencies on both 3.11 (where it's working) and 3.12.\r\n\r\nWill try to bisect a bit what is causing this.",
      "So it works with `tox<4`, but anything higher than that makes the async django tests hang in CI.\r\n\r\nWill spend a bit more time trying to figure this out. But even if I can't and we have to keep tox pinned on 3.12 for now, we can merge this, since it still removes a ton of other pins.",
      "Update on this. Instead of one hanging test we now have three new problems. :)\r\n\r\nSo first of all, even though I removed the pin on tox in the requirements file, it was still limited to `>=3,<4` in the CI yamls. Once you remove that, you end up with three new issues:\r\n1. [FIXED](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/2690/commits/63bf914afbaa7bf26d57088bee99d74737ed50ac): the SQLAlchemy tests on 3.9 will [fail](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/actions/runs/8554859140/job/23441058871?pr=2690) with some threading issue\r\n2. FIXED: the Django tests on older Python versions will [fail](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/actions/runs/8554859141/job/23441069639?pr=2690) because of some test DB setup issues (the DB is not there when it should be, and it is there when it's not supposed to be)\r\n3. and finally, the Django tests will [freeze](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/actions/runs/8554859141/job/23441070488?pr=2690) on 3.12\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNone of these is reproducible locally, only in CI.",
      "Very cool work @sentrivana ! I can also try to spend some time tomorrow to help with this.\r\nBringing our tooling kind of up to date is long time over due :-)\r\n",
      "I just messed around with the Django tests. The problem is the following:\r\n- We have this \"Web Frameworks 1\" test suite that runs multiple test suites in a matrix. \r\n- Every test suite uses the[ service \"postgres\"](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/antonpirker/tooling/.github/workflows/test-integrations-web-frameworks-1.yml#L103-L117) defined in the yaml file. \r\n- And in this postgres service we create one database called \"ci_test\"\r\n- When the first test that is decorator with `pytest_mark_django_db_decorator` is run, the database is filled by running the django migrations. \r\n\r\nAnd my guess now is that when two test suites run at the same time they both want to fill the db by running the migrations and because there is already something in the db, it fails with the `duplicate key value violates unique constraint` error.\r\n\r\nAnd as so often when fixing bugs the question is: How has this ever worked at some point? :-)\r\n\r\nSolution would now be to either have one postgres server by test suite, or one unique database name per test suite. (or maybe create the postgres server in some completely different way)\r\n",
      "I played around more and have this: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/actions/runs/8572070273/job/23493776173?pr=2938\r\n\r\nThe thing now is that in \"Setup Test Env\" i try to delete the uniquely named db name but it does not exist. (which is fine)  Two steps later when running the django tests they fail becaus the db is already existing. So the db is not cleaned up between running different django versions in one call to tox. Not sure why, but this is something for future Anton! ",
      "@antonpirker Maybe this can be somehow combined with `--create-db`/`--reuse-db`? https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database.html#create-db-force-re-creation-of-the-test-database\r\n\r\n```\r\n--create-db - force re creation of the test database\r\n\r\nWhen used with --reuse-db, this option will re-create the database, regardless of whether it exists or not.\r\n```",
      "I think I have solved the problem now in my PR: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/2938\r\nI removed the whole setting of the db name in CI with env variables and just let the django app itself set the database name (including a random number) this way we always have one db with a unique name for a testrun that is also cleaned up by pytest-django. if the tests pass, I will merge my PR into this one\r\n",
      "Ok, the Python 3.12 tests still freeze, but the rest is green so I will merge it into here.",
      "Awesome! The Web Frameworks 1 tests on 3.12 will still time out but that's not a problem with your PR. Everything else seems green so feel free to merge",
      "Regarding the freezing 3.12 tests: the problem goes away as soon as you remove `tox` from `test-requirements.txt`. Which I think we can do -- the purpose of `test-requirements` seems to be to set up the test env after `tox` has already created it.",
      "Marking this as ready for review but we shouldn't merge this until the final release is out."

      "> @n1ngu starting from 6.8 series there is a new log feature, which is used by the tryton server to log events from the user. Maybe you will like to trace such events also in sentry. Do you think this is doable?\r\n\r\nBecause that logging is implemented with a ModelStorage, any `\"ir.model.log\":create` call will get its own span with the present PR! `Model.log` could be instrumented just as create, copy, delete, etc, but there is very few code there. I think it would be more interesting to create spans for `Transaction.commit` or `Transaction._store_log_records` but that can be done out of the box with\r\n```\r\nsentry_sdk.init(\r\n    traces_sample_rate=1/128,\r\n    functions_to_trace=[\r\n        {\"qualified_name\": \"trytond.transaction.Transaction.commit\"},\r\n        {\"qualified_name\": \"trytond.transaction.Transaction._store_log_records\"},\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\nbecause, unlike pool models, Transaction can be statically instrumented. `Transaction.start` is explicitly patched in this PR because I find the whole context manager it creates deserves a span but couldn't figure out how to do that with `functions_to_trace` (I feel I am missing a more obvious solution here)\r\n\r\nI don't know if you meant to capture log events in sentry with [`capture_message`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/usage/#capturing-messages) to send events irrespective of unhandled exceptions and tracing sample rate? That'd be certainly interesting and easily doable! I'll give the idea a try in my staging deployments while this PR settles. I feel the major challenge will be configuring this not to wipe your sentry event ingestion quota :smiling_face_with_tear: ",
      "> Thanks for your contribution, and thanks for your patience as we work through our backlog of community PRs.\r\n>\r\n> Are you finished working on this PR? I noticed that you have added some TODO comments to your code. These should be addressed before we review the changes more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nHi @szokeasaurusrex , thanks for looking into it.\r\n\r\nThose TODOs are more of a wish-list or statement that I believe it'd be worth the effort to work out a better implementation. Definitely not something that prevents this PR from working rather fine as is (we could remove those comments and move on). I recall I had addressed some of them in the implementation I am deploying in production, I should give it some love and update the PR.\r\n\r\nYet,\r\n\r\n1. This integration caused malfunctions under certain conditions which are still under investigation. Because of this and the lack of tests (I'd need your help to address this) I'd flag this PR as experimental. Disabling tracing should keep the integration stable but I'd not feel confident merging this as is.\r\n2. The PR deserves some love and a rebase but we won't be able to work on it in the foreseeable mid-term due to a drift in my organization. So, feel free to close the PR if keeping it open is too noisy for you (unless the Tryton community or the Sentry organization wants to take over the work)\r\n\r\nCheers!",
      "Hey @n1ngu !\r\n\r\nThanks for again for your contribution. I will close this PR for now. \r\n\r\nHope you can pick it up until the waves of your organizations drift have settled. \r\nSentry currently also does not have the resources to pick this PR up. All the best!"

As far as I can tell the problem is we attempt to patch the `RedBeatScheduler` class, but we're not patching it in the right place or at the right time, because when I run this, only the original `maybe_due` is called, but not our wrapped one. Lmk if the code worked for you as is -- in that case it might be something with my setup.",

    "body": "This adds the API for the new Scopes to the code base but does not call/use it. \r\n\r\nThe ideas behind the new Scopes implementation:\r\n\r\n- The current and the isolation scope are saved as `ContextVar`s\r\n- The global scope is a global variable\r\n- In the new context managers `with new_scope()` and `with isolated_scope()` the current and/or isolation scope are forked (meaning copied) and given to the code block wrapped with the context manager. On exit of the code block the current and/or isolation scope are reset to the old value that they had before the with block. (This is basically the same functionality as the push and pop scope of the stack in the current implementation)\r\n- A forked scope holds a reference to the scope it was forked from (the `original_scope`). We need this to implement copy-on-write functionality in forked scopes. As long as you do not change the data in the forked scope, all the data in the forked scope is still the same references as in the original scope. If you manipulate the data, a copy of the data is made and this copy is then changed. (implemented in the `_copy_on_write` decorator, that will be applied to the properties of the Scope when the API is actually implemented. (this [PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/2610)))\r\n- There will always be a client in this implementation. The standard client will be referenced in the global scope. If the SDK is not yet initialized there will also be a client, but it will be a `NoopClient` meaning it can be used as a normal client, but it will not send any data to Sentry. \r\n- There is also the possibility to set a custom client on the Scope (possible on current, isolation and global scope), so one could use multiple clients to send data to different targets\r\n\r\nThere is a follow up PR where the API added in this PR is actually implemented: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/2610",

Would it make sense to differentiate based on which `StatusCode` the `abort` was called with? Let's say we're not interested in `StatusCode.NOT_FOUND`s and would drop those (I'm with you on that), but on the other hand maybe `StatusCode.INTERNAL` or `StatusCode.UNKNOWN` `AbortError`s should be captured by default?\r\n\r\nIf I look at this from an HTTP API point of view, on the server side I wouldn't be interested in client errors, but anything 500+ I'd like to have reported by Sentry.

The two most prominent ones are:\r\n\r\n* creating a dedicated label that, when applied to a PR, triggers a test run\r\n* automatically applying a more restrictive environment to external PRs that requires explicit maintainer approval to run the tests (see https://iterative.ai/blog/testing-external-contributions-using-github-actions-secrets)\r\n\r\nThe former has the potential for race conditions. Since the label is not tied to a specific commit, a malicious code change pushed at roughly the same time the label was applied, but before the workflow has run, could lead to the workflow running unsafe code.\r\n\r\nThe latter (which is the solution in this PR) should not allow this since the test run is directly tied to a specific commit and any new code change invalidates any previous approval.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2487",

I don't think we do tests like this anywhere else; looks like I added them six months ago when I was less familiar with how to best test integrations.\r\n\r\nI think we should just delete the failing tests since they provide little value, but clearly are failing even when they should not.

    "body": "TL;DR: Our way of [parsing](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/085595b5f02931a3268c2de2a58b6986f3766d75/sentry_sdk/integrations/django/transactions.py#L48) named group regexes out of Django URL patterns is [not ideal](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2392#issuecomment-1755797139). If someone is using (Django 2.0+) `<converter:parameter>` `path` patterns, we can parse those directly without turning them into regexes first and potentially hitting our limitations there.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nWhen instrumenting Django for performance monitoring, the Sentry Python SDK will by default name the transactions based on the URL pattern rule that was used to serve the request.\r\n\r\nThere are two main ways of creating a URL pattern in Django: by using regexes in the rule directly, or (since Django 2.0) by using the custom `<converter:parameter>` syntax, like so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nurlpatterns = [\r\n    path('articles/<int:year>/<int:month>/', views.month_archive),\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese `<converter:parameter>` style patterns are also regexes in the background. Each of the converters defines its own regex (see e.g. the [IntConverter](https://github.com/django/django/blob/7bb741d787ba360a9f0d490db92e22e0d28204ed/django/urls/converters.py#L5-L12)) that is then used for matching URLs to the patterns.\r\n\r\nThe SDK is [parsing](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/085595b5f02931a3268c2de2a58b6986f3766d75/sentry_sdk/integrations/django/transactions.py#L48) both types of patterns with the aim of replacing all named groups with placeholders, so that e.g. the URL pattern above creates transactions with the name `articles/{year}/{month}`. To do this, the URL pattern is first turned into its regex form and then parsed with the RavenResolver.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem with the default set of converters Django offers, but if folks define [their own custom converters](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2446) whose regexes don't play nice with our RavenResolver, we fail to extract the transaction name correctly. This can be prevented by parsing the original, simpler URL pattern instead without turning it into its regex form.\r\n\r\nNote that this doesn't solve all transaction name problems as `re_path`s are still vulnerable, but it should make new-style `path`s work.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2446",

If I understood the documentation correctly, you are putting a TCP connection back into the pool while the response body still has to be read.\r\n\r\nI would guess that if you start sending new requests into that connection, the server may choose to terminate the connection because from their POV you're misbehaving. Even if that happens, urllib3 _may_ transparently recover from that scenario by creating a new connection, but I am not sure. You'd have to test what actually happens. I suggest spinning up a http server locally and looking at wireshark (open it, look at loopback device lo0 and apply \"http\" filter)\r\n\r\nI don't exactly understand what `preload_conn` does, but from what I can tell the original `True` value would've prevented this issue because it just behaves like \"draining\".\r\n\r\nThis assumes http1, i have no idea what happens with http2.

When a command is being executed through the cluster instance, the target node(s) will be internally determined. When using a key-based command, the target node will be the node that holds the key’s slot. Cluster management commands and other commands that are not key-based have a parameter called ‘target_nodes’ where you can specify which nodes to execute the command on. In the absence of target_nodes, the command will be executed on the default cluster node. As part of cluster instance initialization, the cluster’s default node is randomly selected from the cluster’s primaries, and will be updated upon reinitialization. Using r.get_default_node(), you can get the cluster’s default node, or you can change it using the ‘set_default_node’ method.\r\n\r\nThis likely means that it is difficult to get the actual node information and the default node will not always be the one used.",

Any feedback is welcome!\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n- The integration, if enabled, will automatically remove the existing Strawberry Sentry tracing extension, if present, to avoid conflicts.\r\n- The error monitoring will only work if folks don't override the default [process_result](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/blob/9c946a2d4f56b81dfb0e58e4a9ed2aa89adfc1c8/strawberry/http/__init__.py#L18-L26). This is not optimal but it was the most straightforward place to hook into.\r\n- I've made some changes to the tracing extension, mostly renaming things (e.g. span `op`s) to comply with [our](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/) and/or [OTel](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/semantic_conventions/instrumentation/graphql/) conventions.

      "I made the changes you suggested @alisoam , thx for raising :+1: :smile: \r\n\r\nStarted writing the unary-stream client interceptor for async also, however, I would need some clarification on this topic. I am not extremely familiar with those functionalities and would rather first coordinate.\r\n\r\nIs the behavior implemented in the sync version for unary-stream the desired one? It creates one span when the request is incoming which ends as soon as the `UnaryStreamCall` object obtained from the `continuation` is returned. However, this is only half the story, because AFAIU later the client will iterate over that object to obtain the individual messages from the server.\r\n\r\nSo I think the solution could be to return a custom `UnaryStreamCall` object which wraps also the `read` method of the underlying object into a span. Due to my atm quite limited understanding of the internals of this, this is mostly guesswork, however.\r\n\r\nIf there's somebody here who can give me a bit more of an insight I can add it to this PR, else I'd suggest opening a follow up issue for the other types of calls (stream-unary and stream-stream were not touched yet at all) :+1: :wink: ",

Will then be two interceptors do the same thing?

There the version is correct: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/ba6de38d915a2d66a7633017306c425ba4b34a72/setup.py#L63",

      "@sentrivana Ah, OK, I was a bit wrong. Here is what happened: I was in the process of packaging the latest version for Fedora (https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-sentry-sdk) and the build failed because of import error in the referenced place. Previously, it worked because all the modules `sentry_sdk.integrations.opentelemetry.*` were importable (I assumed that I can and should check these modules, since `opentelemetry` integration lived there). However, a new module with unsatisfied dependency (Fedora version of `opentelemetry-distro` is lower than `0.40b0`) broke the build. I can of course add this module (`sentry_sdk.integrations.opentelemetry.integration`) to the ignore-list for import checking, however it's likely that other packagers will bump into the same issue (maybe it'll be the problem somewhere else). What do you think?",
      "@rominf Gotcha, thanks for the extra context! 👍🏻\r\n\r\nI'd prefer if we could keep the `opentelemetry-distro>=0.35b0` lower bound as is to not cut off folks with older `opentelemetry-distro` versions. The new module that was added (`sentry_sdk.integrations.opentelemetry.integration`) is part of an experimental opt-in feature, so it shouldn't dictate the lower bound on an actual existing feature/dependency that was there before.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the functions exist almost in the same shape in `0.35b0`, they're just in a different place and one of them is named slightly differently. If we were to do a conditional import in `sentry_sdk.integrations.opentelemetry.integration` like this...\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    # for opentelemetry-distro 0.40b0\r\n    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.auto_instrumentation._load import _load_distro, _load_instrumentors\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    # for opentelemetry-distro versions between 0.35b0 and 0.39b0\r\n    from opentelemetry.old_fun_location import _load_distros as _load_distro, _load_instrumentors  \r\n```\r\n...would that work from a packaging perspective?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, do you see anything else we can do SDK-side to mark the `_load` import or the whole `sentry_sdk.integrations.opentelemetry.integration` module as optional?\r\n\r\nAdding the module to the ignore list for import checks sounds like the way to go to me atm, but would like to have your opinion on the above. ",
      "> I'd prefer if we could keep the opentelemetry-distro>=0.35b0 lower bound as is to not cut off folks with older opentelemetry-distro versions.\r\n\r\nI agree!\r\n\r\n> It seems that the functions exist almost in the same shape in 0.35b0, they're just in a different place and one of them is named slightly differently.

      "So the conditional import won't work since there's some [top level unguarded function running in the original module](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/05e23cd280dfb6cbdc282aac223abc9d4fda2ef4/opentelemetry-instrumentation/src/opentelemetry/instrumentation/auto_instrumentation/sitecustomize.py#L127).\r\n\r\nI think putting `sentry_sdk.integrations.opentelemetry.integration` on the ignore list sounds good for now.",

I am back.\r\n\r\n> I think putting sentry_sdk.integrations.opentelemetry.integration on the ignore list sounds good for now.\r\n\r\nNo, this does not work neither for packaging, nor for end users of `opentelemetry` integration with `opentelemetry-distro` versions between `0.35b0` and `0.39b0` because of this line: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/9bbd480cb6866e5938cc1a853343924248e71169/sentry_sdk/integrations/opentelemetry/__init__.py#L1, which is imported while importing:\r\n```\r\nfrom sentry_sdk.integrations.opentelemetry import SentrySpanProcessor, SentryPropagator\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an issue for Fedora packaging in particular, since there is no `opentelemetry-distro>=0.40b0` for [actual Fedoras](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/python-opentelemetry-contrib/python3-opentelemetry-distro/) (Fedora Rawhide is incubating version of Fedora, all other versions are actual), also I cannot simply drop `opentelemetry` integration from a new version. Currently I am stuck with `sentry-sdk==1.29.2` because of this.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?",
      "Hey @rominf, sorry for the wait, was out of office last week.\r\n\r\nWe can definitely [remove the offending import](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/2379/files) from `__init__.py`. Does that look good to you?",
      "Hey @sentrivana. Thank you! I think it should work fine.",
      "Thanks for checking! Merged it now, it'll be out with the next release, likely next week at the latest."

      "Hey @sentrivana \r\nThanks for bringing this to my attention.\r\nPossible solution I can think of\r\n1. use _importlib.metadata_ and _pkg_resources_ along with a try except block inside the flask.py to get the version. (pkg_resources.get_distribution(\"flask\").version). Similar to the '_generate_installed_modules' function but specifically for flask.\r\n2. Reuse the __get_installed_modules_ as is and extract flask version. also rename the function without the leading underscore\r\n3.  Re-design the '_get_installed_modules' to also fetch the version for a specific module if given an input.\r\n",
      "Hey @vagi8. I'd go with option 2. The `_get_installed_modules` function is set up so that the actual module version collection only runs once the first time it's called and is then cached in a global variable. Any subsequent calls to it will just read the global variable. So calling it from the Flask integration wouldn't mean that it would be gathering info for all modules again, if that's your concern. It's fine to call it as is.\r\n\r\nLet's please keep the leading underscore though, the intention there is to mark it as not part of the public API."

Since my local settings differ from what is stored in the repo, I always need to make sure not to stage my .vscode directory when commuting changes in Git. Since different developers may have different VSCode configurations, I don’t see any reason why we should be tracking this directory in our repo.\r\n\r\nSolution Brainstorm\r\nAdd the .vscode directory to .gitignore. If we implement this change, we should probably also delete the .vscode directory from the GitHub repo.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have successfully deleted the .vscode directory from the project and also added .vscode directory in .gitignore file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I noticed `asyncpg` uses the postgres binary protocol to communicate to postgres. I haven't had any encounter with that yet, but it's making it more challenging to record the creation of cursors, transactions, and prepared statements properly. Do you have a suggestion what to do about this? Keep in mind that all of this is done in Cython, ie we would need to tap into that lower level for recording the exact statements and reverse parsing the binary protocol.\r\n2. For cursors and prepared statements, what is the desired outcome? Should the creation be recorded, and every subsequent use, or just the creation, or just the usages?\r\n3. I've noticed that `tracing_utils:record_sql_queries` checks the `hub.client.options[\"_experiments\"][\"record_sql_params\"]` and strips out the parameters if it's `True`. However, I did not want to rely on it to strip out parameters, as there is a `TODO` right with it, that hints at a future removal of that check. Therefore I strip them out per default, but provide a config option to the integration for recording the parameters. \r\n4. I've noticed that the `test-requirements.txt` doesn't contain `pytest-asyncio`, yet the `pytest.ini` configures the `asyncio_mode` to `strict`. Am I missing something here, or is this on purpose?\r\n\r\n@antonpirker please let me know what you think :) ",

      "> 1. I noticed asyncpg uses the postgres binary protocol to communicate to postgres. I haven't had any encounter with that yet, but it's making it more challenging to record the creation of cursors, transactions, and prepared statements properly. Do you have a suggestion what to do about this? Keep in mind that all of this is done in Cython, ie we would need to tap into that lower level for recording the exact statements and reverse parsing the binary protocol.\r\n\r\nFor the first iteration of the asyncpg support it is enough if we record spans for execute, executemany (and maybe db connect if it is easy) The rest we can ignore for now. This will already give a lot of value to users.\r\n\r\n> 2. For cursors and prepared statements, what is the desired outcome? Should the creation be recorded, and every subsequent use, or just the creation, or just the usages?\r\n\r\nI think we can omit those for now. See above.",

    "body": "For capturing GraphQL responses we're `read()`ing the `HTTPResponse` returned by `http.client.HTTPConnection.getresponse`, which exhausts the payload and it can't be read again by client applications. The original workaround for this was saving the payload in a `BytesIO` and aliasing `HTTPResponse.read` to the `BytesIO`'s `read`. This works when using http.client directly, but stops working with `urllib3`, which tries to determine whether there's anything left to read by checking if the response is closed, which in turn checks the internal `fp` file object. By the time we've `read()` the response, `fp` is `None`, and the response appears closed. This PR patches `fp` to point to the `BytesIO` saved response.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2285",

    "body": "This is a PR for powering our performance monitoring with OTel instead of our custom Sentry instrumentation. Note that this is a proof of concept which we might end up utilizing or not -- depending on how successful this attempt is at addressing the various issues we've identified with regards to our compatibility with OTel.\r\n\r\nSee the [associated issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2251) for more details on the motivation behind this.\r\n\r\n## On OTel's `opentelemetry-instrument`\r\n\r\nAs the goal was to make this work automatically without requiring the user to set anything up, the autoinstrumentation builds on what the official `opentelemetry-instrument` tool does, but without having to actually use it to run a program (`opentelemetry-instrument python app.py`). \r\n\r\nWhat `opentelemetry-instrument` does to make autoinstrumentation work is that it uses the built-in [site](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html?highlight=site#module-site) mechanism to run the instrumentation code before anything else is run. In simplified terms, `site` is a Python module loaded at interpreter start that looks for a file called `sitecustomize.py` in specific locations and if it finds it, it loads and runs it before any user code is run. `sitecustomize.py` is usually meant to be put in `site-packages`. `opentelemetry-instrument` works around this by first doing [some path manipulation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/7603a1fc69474398289c2944796249e70bba0c82/opentelemetry-instrumentation/src/opentelemetry/instrumentation/auto_instrumentation/__init__.py) before [`execl`-ing](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/7603a1fc69474398289c2944796249e70bba0c82/opentelemetry-instrumentation/src/opentelemetry/instrumentation/auto_instrumentation/__init__.py#L115) to force `site` to look at [its sitecustomize.py](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/7603a1fc69474398289c2944796249e70bba0c82/opentelemetry-instrumentation/src/opentelemetry/instrumentation/auto_instrumentation/sitecustomize.py), which does the autoinstrumentation. Being able to ensure that the autoinstrumentation runs before any user code is handy since by the time actual user code is executed, everything necessary has been monkeypatched in the background.\r\n\r\nWe can't use the `sitecustomize.py` hack unless we also want to `execl` the user program, which seems dangerous. This means we need to require folks to `sentry_sdk.init()` before importing any class that's supposed to get instrumented. This PR tries to work around that by looking at `sys.modules` after the autoinstrumentation has finished patching, searching for unpatched classes, and patching them.\r\n\r\n## Differences to `opentelemetry-instrument`\r\n\r\nWe're doing the same things as OTel does for autoinstrumenting, with some differences.\r\n\r\nThe autoinstrumentation itself is taken from [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/7603a1fc69474398289c2944796249e70bba0c82/opentelemetry-instrumentation/src/opentelemetry/instrumentation/auto_instrumentation/sitecustomize.py#L36-L39). We do the same except calling `load_configurators()`, which as far as I can tell does [this](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/blob/c9277ffb137fad999ee14bee4f99bad2d00b8b03/opentelemetry-sdk/src/opentelemetry/sdk/_configuration/__init__.py#L337) in the background. OTel describes configurators as [\"Configurators are used to configure SDKs (i.e. TracerProvider, MeterProvider, Processors...) to reduce the amount of manual configuration required.\"](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/blob/c9277ffb137fad999ee14bee4f99bad2d00b8b03/opentelemetry-sdk/src/opentelemetry/sdk/_configuration/__init__.py#L374-L376) The autoinstrumentation seems to work fine without this, and we do some minimal configuration ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe also don't do any [PYTHONPATH manipulations](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/7603a1fc69474398289c2944796249e70bba0c82/opentelemetry-instrumentation/src/opentelemetry/instrumentation/auto_instrumentation/__init__.py#L112) since these seem to only have to do with making the `sitecustomize` trick describe above work and are then [reverted right away](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/commit/c90935395fb52807490e3d50be58b6133c44b31b).\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2251",

change in the sense that <code>requires-python</code> has been updated, so users using 3.7 should still receive <code>v4.17.3</code> when installing the library.</li>\n<li>On draft 2019-09, <code>unevaluatedItems</code> now properly does <em>not</em> consider items to be evaluated by an <code>additionalItems</code> schema if <code>items</code> is missing from the schema, as the specification says in this case that <code>additionalItems</code> must be completely ignored.</li>\n<li>Fix the <code>date</code> format checker on Python 3.11 (when format assertion behavior is enabled), where it was too liberal (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/issues/1076\">#1076</a>).</li>\n<li>Speed up validation of <code>unevaluatedProperties</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/issues/1075\">#1075</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>jsonschema.RefResolver</code> -- see above for details on the replacement</li>\n<li><code>jsonschema.RefResolutionError</code> -- see above for details on the replacement</li>\n<li>relying on automatic resolution of remote references -- see above for details on the replacement</li>\n<li>importing <code>jsonschema.ErrorTree</code> -- instead import it via <code>jsonschema.exceptions.ErrorTree</code></li>\n<li>importing <code>jsonschema.FormatError</code> -- instead import it via <code>jsonschema.exceptions.FormatError</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Contributors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DanielNoord\"><code>@​DanielNoord</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/pull/1021\">python-jsonschema/jsonschema#1021</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aryanA101a\"><code>@​aryanA101a</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/pull/1063\">python-jsonschema/jsonschema#1063</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jvtm\"><code>@​jvtm</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/pull/1076\">python-jsonschema/jsonschema#1076</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ikonst\"><code>@​ikonst</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/pull/1075\">python-jsonschema/jsonschema#1075</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/compare/v4.17.3...v4.18.0\">https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/compare/v4.17.3...v4.18.0</a></p>\n<h2>v4.18.0a10</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/compare/v4.18.0a9...v4.18.0a10\">https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/compare/v4.18.0a9...v4.18.0a10</a></p>\n<h2>v4.18.0a9</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/compare/v4.18.0a8...v4.18.0a9\">https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema/compare/v4.18.0a8...v4.18.0a9</a></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

      "@goharShoukat It's a great first contribution! Congrats! :)\r\n\r\nThe change I made to the test had to do with the change I made to the behavior of the `get_error_message` function (this line specifically https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/2193/files#diff-e9f88ca6368ce622839e078ed26c741a927752c01ceae64cd504d3ae86de6fd2R689). Before this PR, we were falling back to `safe_str(exc_value)` in case we didn't succeed in getting the `message` attribute, but in the previous version of this PR we would just return an empty string if we didn't find neither `message` nor `detail`, which would have been a breaking change from before. I then had to adjust the test to also check that the fallback is `safe_str(exc_value)` and not an empty string.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense.

Other libraries provide such as [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry) or [Ariadne](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne) provide this integration.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this would help anyone who uses GraphQL under Starlette attribute Sentry events to a GraphQL operation, and it is library agnostic.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be to create a separate integration, which [I implemented here](https://github.com/Pocket/recommendation-api/blob/de445ba76a7950738a7529c166beb5c86a428118/app/graphql/sentry_graphql_middleware.py). The downside is that it duplicates some complex patching logic. Strawberry (our GraphQL library of choice) doesn't support middleware. Could a Sentry integration be created for it nonetheless? Would that be preferable to getting the operationName from Starlette?",

Instead only <code>subjectAltName</code>\nis used to verify the hostname by default. To enable verifying the hostname against\n<code>commonName</code> use <code>SSLContext.hostname_checks_common_name = True</code> (<code>[#2113](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2113) &lt;https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2113&gt;</code>__).</li>\n<li>Removed support for Python with an <code>ssl</code> module compiled with LibreSSL, CiscoSSL,\nwolfSSL, and all other OpenSSL alternatives.

      "Also, just to point out some of the extra work that went into this on the Sentry side, note that an error such as the one shown above will be titled and grouped by the first inner exception:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/assets/1396388/daf05864-756e-4a94-bc72-01ce33e2e136)\r\n\r\nThat's because all exceptions within the group are of the same type and have similar values.   Without this, the error would be titled by the root exception, \"NonBaseMultiError: multiple tasks failed\" - which could make it difficult to distinguish between issues on the issues overview.  Also different quantities of inner exceptions of the same type and similar values will be grouped together, rather than separately. (i.e. having `ValueError:echo` two, three, or four times in the group shouldn't make them different issues.)\r\n\r\nConversely, when the inner exceptions differ significantly - _then_ we'll use the exception group as the title, and group issues based on the combination of the types and values of the inner exceptions.  For example:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/assets/1396388/35cc8dc8-336d-47e3-9037-ce87fbc30a0d)\r\n\r\nWill get titled as:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/assets/1396388/9ebe4eab-7f07-48a5-a3c9-af48979f2a9f)\r\n\r\nIf another of the same exception comes through but the `KeyError` and `IndexError` exceptions are swapped, it will still get grouped together as another occurrence of the same issue."

As supporting evidence, the abstract base class `Span` has `get_span_context` but no `context` defined.\r\n\r\nA small piece of feedback: looking at the tests for `opentelemetry`, in general it seems like they test mock objects rather than than actual objects from the opentelemetry library. Is there a reason for this? Using the underlying objects (span implementations and the like) feels like it would help prevent bugs like this one. At least using the ABC/API interfaces to generate some stubs so we know what we are testing conforms to the interface.

      "Hey @PerchunPak \r\n\r\nI finally had some time to play with this integration. Nice work!\r\n\r\nI create a small test project for testing:\r\n```python\r\nfrom loguru import logger as loguru_logger\r\n\r\nimport sentry_sdk\r\nimport sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru\r\nsentry_sdk.init(\r\n    dsn=\"...\",\r\n    integrations=[\r\n        sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru.LoguruIntegration(),\r\n    ],\r\n    traces_sample_rate=1.0, \r\n    debug=True,\r\n)\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    loguru_logger.debug(\"Guru: I am ignored\")\r\n    loguru_logger.info(\"Guru: I am a breadcrumb\")\r\n    loguru_logger.error(\"Guru: I am an event\", extra=dict(bar=43))\r\n    loguru_logger.exception(\"Guru: An exception happened\")    \r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the `error` log entry creates an \"information like\" event in Sentry and the `exception` log entry creates an exception in Sentry. Very nice!\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 12 03 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/202325/234545424-308a7e3d-81eb-4adc-8777-c11fd997878c.png)\r\n\r\nThe error message contains all the formatted Loguru message with all the information. This is not the best developer experience. Could you please change this, to only contain the message from the call to \"loguru_logger.exception()\"?\r\n\r\nOne other thing I noticed is, that `loguru_logger.exception()` does not attach an exception object, so this code is never reached: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/integrations/logging.py#L209-L213\r\n\r\nIs this just how Loguru works, or am I doing something wrong?",
      "> The error message contains all the formatted Loguru message with all the information. This is not the best developer experience. Could you please change this, to only contain the message from the call to \"loguru_logger.exception()\"?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, looks like no. Loguru parses the message before it is passed to our handler, so we get only a formatted message. We can somehow cut unnecessary parts (e.g. regex or build the unnecessary parts of message by ourselves to cut it) or we can change the format of messages to contain only plain messages (`loguru.add(..., format=\"{message}\")`). The second way will make it impossible to include loguru's data into messages.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68118654/234688570-1efef91a-03eb-4883-b7ea-acbd98bedc92.png)\r\n\r\n> Is this just how Loguru works, or am I doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nBoth, you don't catch any exception, so loguru doesn't provide it. This code works, and also doesn't send formatted messages by loguru in the report name.\r\n\r\n```py\r\ntry:\r\n    1 / 0\r\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\r\n    loguru_logger.exception(\"Guru: An exception happened\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there is no exception, loguru prints `None` to the console (is it a bug?)\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from loguru import logger\r\n>>> logger.exception(\"Guru: An exception happened\") \r\n2023-04-26 21:29:02.780 | ERROR    | __main__:<module>:1 - Guru: An exception happened\r\nNoneType: None\r\n```",
      "> or we can change the format of messages to contain only plain messages (loguru.add(..., format=\"{message}\")).\r\n\r\nWe should not do this. We should never change the behavior of the users code, just add functionality on top of it.\r\nAs the users can set whatever formatting that she likes the regex approach seems not possible. \r\n\r\nCan we \"build the unnecessary parts of message\" with the formatting the users has set so it always works, no matter what the configuration of the user looks like?\r\n",
      "Or one other option: can we hook into something that is run before our handler, where we have access to the raw message?\r\n",
      "`loguru` works different from `logging` module. In `logging`, you can set the format of message globally, while in `loguru` - every handler can have a customized message (handler added with `logger.add`). We can't get the user's message, because the user can configure multiple loggers, that will output to multiple terminals/files. E.g. the user wants to have logs in files too, so they will just do\r\n\r\n```python\r\nloguru.add(\"logs.txt\", format=\"some custom format\")  # and maybe some rotation, doesn't matter\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if we will monkeypatch `loguru`'s global handler - we will get duplicates because\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlogger.info(\"hi!\")\r\n# calls all handlers:\r\n# 0 - default (stderr logger)\r\n# 1 - what we added upper (log into file)\r\n# 2 - sentry's breadcrumb handler   # only if INFO >= logging_level > ERROR\r\n# 3 - sentry's event handler        # only if ERROR >= logging_level\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of them can have custom format, so we can't catch what the user actually sees in the terminal. BUT we can provide configuration options that we will send into `loguru`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, as I understand, all info that provides `loguru` in the console, Sentry provides too in the UI.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import sentry_sdk\r\n... import sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru\r\n... sentry_sdk.init(\r\n...     dsn=\"...\",\r\n...     integrations=[\r\n...         sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru.LoguruIntegration(),\r\n...     ],\r\n...     traces_sample_rate=1.0,\r\n...     debug=True,\r\n... )\r\n [sentry] DEBUG: Setting up integrations (with default = True)\r\n ...\r\n>>> from loguru import logger\r\n>>> import sys\r\n>>> logger.add(sys.stdout, format=\"{time} {level} {message}\")\r\n>>> logger.info(\"hi\")\r\n2023-04-28T09:02:25.169723+0200 INFO hi\r\n2023-04-28 09:02:25.169 | INFO     | __main__:<module>:1 - hi\r\n>>> logger.error(\"test\")\r\n2023-04-28 09:02:36.507 | ERROR    | __main__:<module>:1 - test\r\n [sentry] DEBUG: Sending envelope [envelope with 1 items (error)] project:... host:....ingest.sentry.io\r\n2023-04-28T09:02:36.507423+0200 ERROR test\r\n [sentry] DEBUG: [Tracing] Adding `sentry-trace` header ...-...- to outgoing request to https://....ingest.sentry.io/api/.../envelope/.\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68118654/235079241-4a6d0023-5373-4692-b6fa-dd307a99c2c5.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> can we hook into something that is run before our handler, where we have access to the raw message?\r\n\r\nI did this via appending this code to the end of our loguru integration module\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport loguru._simple_sinks\r\n\r\nclass PatchedStandardSink(loguru._simple_sinks.StandardSink):\r\n    def write(self, message):\r\n        parsed_record = None\r\n        actual_message = message.record[\"message\"]\r\n\r\n        def handler_hande(record):\r\n            nonlocal parsed_record\r\n            parsed_record = record\r\n\r\n        original_handler_handle = self._handler.handle\r\n        self._handler.handle = handler_hande\r\n        original_write(self, message)\r\n\r\n        parsed_record.message = actual_message\r\n        parsed_record.msg = actual_message\r\n\r\n        original_handler_handle(parsed_record)\r\n\r\n\r\noriginal_write = loguru._simple_sinks.StandardSink.write\r\nloguru._simple_sinks.StandardSink.write = PatchedStandardSink.write\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this gives absolutely the same result as just setting `format=\"{message}\"`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68118654/235085472-30fd9236-06af-4443-87eb-b04902e1e60d.png)\r\n",

This would give the correct thread ID in the context for other functions bar route handlers.\r\n\r\nI did consider that at one point but I noticed that `ensure_async` is called by more than just the route handlers. And if I understood it correctly, that means after setting the thread ID for the handler, other methods can happen and change the thread ID. Is this correct? If so, I don't think patching `ensure_async` is the right thing to do here.",

(As the total time to respond will include these). If not I think what is in this PR does make the most sense.\r\n\r\nSo even if the other calls to `ensure_async` are also captured in the same transaction, I think the justification here is that these other calls are not the \"core\" work done for that transaction. So if one of these calls happens after the request handler, we'd end up showing a different thread as the active thread for the profile which can be misleading to the end user. So while this approach will only correctly show the right thread for some requests, I think it's better the result is predictable rather than relying on how other code calls `ensure_async` to not change the active thread id.",

      "Hey @rynmlng !\r\nI had a look at your contribution, and I am afraid I can not merge this. This adds to much overhead in maintaining and also maintaining the documentation.\r\n\r\nBut there is a solution for your problem, you can add the method in a `before_send` hook. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sentry_sdk\r\n\r\ndef add_method_to_transaction_name(event, hint):\r\n    # modify event here\r\n    event[\"transaction\"] = f\"{event[\"request\"]['method']} {event[\"transaction\"]}\"\r\n    return event\r\n\r\nsentry_sdk.init(\r\n    dsn=\"...\",\r\n    before_send=add_method_to_transaction_name,\r\n)\r\n```",
      "The solution above is for error events. (And there is a small bug `\"request\"` in the f-string should be `'request'`.",
      "If you want to change the transaction name for all kind of events (errors and transactions (the stuff ending up in the \"performance\" main menu item on sentry.io)) you can write an `event_processor`.\r\n\r\nThis is a little bit more complicated, because you first have to fetch the HTTP method in a Django middleware because the `event_processor` has no access to the Django request:\r\n\r\n1: Middleware to save the http method:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# middleware.py\r\nimport sentry_sdk\r\n\r\ndef sentry_middleware(get_response):\r\n    def middleware(request):\r\n        with sentry_sdk.configure_scope() as scope:\r\n            # Saving HTTP method into Sentry scope\r\n            scope.set_extra(\"http_method\", request.method)\r\n        \r\n        response = get_response(request)\r\n        return response\r\n\r\n    return middleware\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add the event processor:\r\n```python\r\nsentry_sdk.init(\r\n    dsn=\"...\",\r\n)\r\n\r\ndef make_nice_transaction_name(event, hint):\r\n    # Get HTTP method from Sentry scope\r\n    event[\"transaction\"] = f\"{event['extra']['http_method']} {event['transaction']}\"\r\n    return event\r\n\r\nwith sentry_sdk.configure_scope() as scope:\r\n    scope.add_event_processor(make_nice_transaction_name)\r\n```",

Moreover, we added support for asdf format as Node.js version file <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/373\">actions/setup-node#373</a>. Besides, we introduced new output <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/534\">node-version</a> and added <code>npm-shrinkwrap.json</code> to dependency file patterns: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/439\">actions/setup-node#439</a></p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 2.0.2</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes related to GHES 3.5 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/460\">actions/setup-node#460</a>)</p>\n<h2>v3.0.0</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we changed version of the runtime Node.js for the setup-node action and updated package-lock.json file to  v2.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the update to Node 16 in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/414\">actions/setup-node#414</a>, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.</li>\n<li>We removed deprecated <code>version</code> input (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/424\">actions/setup-node#424</a>). Please use <code>node-version</code> input instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fix logic of error handling for npm warning and uncaught exception</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we fix logic of error handling related to caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/358\">actions/setup-node#358</a>) and (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/359\">actions/setup-node#359</a>).</p>\n<p>In the previous behaviour we relied on <code>stderr</code> output to throw error. The warning messages from package managers can be written to the stderr's output. For now the action will throw an error only if exit code differs from zero. Besides, we add logic to сatch and log unhandled exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <code>node-version-file</code> input and update <code>actions/cache</code> dependency to the latest version.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>The new input (<code>node-version-file</code>) provides functionality to specify the path to the file containing Node.js's version with such behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the file does not exist the action will throw an error.</li>\n<li>If you specify both <code>node-version</code> and <code>node-version-file</code> inputs, the action will use value from the <code>node-version</code> input and throw the following warning: <code>Both node-version and node-version-file inputs are specified, only node-version will be used</code>.</li>\n<li>For now the action does not support all of the variety of values for Node.js version files. The action can handle values according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node#supported-version-syntax\">documentation</a> and values with <code>v</code> prefix (<code>v14</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - name: Setup node from node version file\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n    with:\n      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'\n  - run: npm install\n  - run: npm test\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Update actions/cache dependency to 1.0.8 version.</h2>\n<p>We updated actions/cache dependency to the latest version (1.0.8). For more information please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md\">toolkit/cache</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add &quot;cache-hit&quot; output</h2>\n<p>This release introduces a new output: <code>cache-hit</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/327\">#327</a>).</p>\n<p>The <code>cache-hit</code> output contains boolean value indicating that an exact match was found for the key. It shows that the action uses already existing cache or not. The output is available only if cache is enabled.</p>\n<h2>Support caching for mono repos and repositories with complex structure</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/305\">#305</a>).</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (<code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code>) in the repository root. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories. This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Doing this is likely\nnot something most users, even metaschema authors, may need, but occasionally\nwill be useful for advanced use cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v4.12.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix some stray comments in the README.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v4.12.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Warn at runtime when subclassing validator classes. Doing so was not\nintended to be public API, though it seems some downstream libraries\ndo so. A future version will make this an error, as it is brittle and\nbetter served by composing validator objects instead. Feel free to reach\nout if there are any cases where changing existing code seems difficult\nand I can try to provide guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v4.11.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the rendered README in PyPI simpler and fancier.

In other words, they may use draft2020-12 to define\nwhich schemas are valid, but the schemas themselves use draft7 (or a custom\ndialect, etc.) to define which <em>instances</em> are valid. Doing this is likely\nnot something most users, even metaschema authors, may need, but occasionally\nwill be useful for advanced use cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v4.12.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix some stray comments in the README.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v4.12.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Warn at runtime when subclassing validator classes. Doing so was not\nintended to be public API, though it seems some downstream libraries\ndo so.

In other words, they may use draft2020-12 to define\nwhich schemas are valid, but the schemas themselves use draft7 (or a custom\ndialect, etc.) to define which <em>instances</em> are valid. Doing this is likely\nnot something most users, even metaschema authors, may need, but occasionally\nwill be useful for advanced use cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v4.12.1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix some stray comments in the README.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v4.12.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Warn at runtime when subclassing validator classes. Doing so was not\nintended to be public API, though it seems some downstream libraries\ndo so. A future version will make this an error, as it is brittle and\nbetter served by composing validator objects instead. Feel free to reach\nout if there are any cases where changing existing code seems difficult\nand I can try to provide guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v4.11.0</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the rendered README in PyPI simpler and fancier.

There is an extra indirection, however I don't\r\nthink this is on any hot path.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Anton Pirker <anton.pirker@sentry.io>"

      "To validate the profiler, I used [this Flask server](https://github.com/getsentry/apple-system-symbols-upload/tree/szokasaurusrex/flask-profiler-test) (which is just a script used by the profiling team that has been wrapped within a Flask server). To verify profiles were being generated and uploaded, I ran the Flask server in single-threaded mode with `flask run --without-threads`. I then initiated a request to `localhost:5000/` and waited for the request to finish (it took several minutes). The server log output is available [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/files/9204023/stdout.txt). I then opened Sentry and verified that [the profile was uploaded](https://sentry.io/organizations/specto-dev/profiling/profile/python-profiler/7687244f50134736836cdc72cea20fd9/flamegraph/?colorCoding=by+symbol+name&query=&sorting=call+order&tid=4338271616&view=top+down&xAxis=standalone). A screenshot of the profile is provided below.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7881302/181376455-1a451f65-64e8-4514-af05-0d3d7d102f95.png)\r\n\r\nI also validated that a multi-threaded server would not break with the profiler enabled. To perform this verification, I ran the server in multi-threaded mode with `flask run` (without the `--without-threads` flag this time), and I initiated a request to `localhost:5000`. The request was completed successfully without errors; the server log is available [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/files/9204052/stdout-multithreaded.txt). However, as expected, no profiles were generated since the server request was not being processed on the main thread.\r\n"

Please use more specific and flexible syntax to specify a PyPy version:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        python-version:\n        - 'pypy-2.7' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 2.7\n        - 'pypy-3.8' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 3.8\n        - 'pypy-3.8-v7.3.8' # Python 3.8 and PyPy 7.3.8\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - uses: actions/setup-python@v3\n      with:\n        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>See more usage examples in the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-python#specifying-a-pypy-version\">documentation</a></p>\n<h2>Update primary and restore keys for pip</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/303\">include a version of python in restore and primary cache keys for pip</a>. Besides, we add temporary fix for Windows caching <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/332\">issue</a>, that the <code>pip cache dir</code> command returns non zero exit code or writes to stderr. Moreover we updated <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/327\">node-fetch dependency</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 1.0.8</h2>\n<p>We have updated <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md#108\">actions/cache</a> dependency version to 1.0.8 to support 10GB cache upload</p>\n<h2>Support caching dependencies</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/266\">actions/setup-python#266</a>)</p>\n<h2>Caching dependencies.</h2>\n<p>The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring pip/pipenv dependencies. The <code>cache</code> input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.</p>\n<p>Besides, this release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure.</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (requirements.txt for pip or Pipfile.lock for pipenv) in the whole repository. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when you want to override current behaviour and use different file for hash generation (for example requirements-dev.txt). This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Caching pip dependencies:</h3>\n<pre><code>steps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Please use <code>node-version</code> input instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fix logic of error handling for npm warning and uncaught exception</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we fix logic of error handling related to caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/358\">actions/setup-node#358</a>) and (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/359\">actions/setup-node#359</a>).</p>\n<p>In the previous behaviour we relied on <code>stderr</code> output to throw error. The warning messages from package managers can be written to the stderr's output. For now the action will throw an error only if exit code differs from zero. Besides, we add logic to сatch and log unhandled exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <code>node-version-file</code> input and update <code>actions/cache</code> dependency to the latest version.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>The new input (<code>node-version-file</code>) provides functionality to specify the path to the file containing Node.js's version with such behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the file does not exist the action will throw an error.</li>\n<li>If you specify both <code>node-version</code> and <code>node-version-file</code> inputs, the action will use value from the <code>node-version</code> input and throw the following warning: <code>Both node-version and node-version-file inputs are specified, only node-version will be used</code>.</li>\n<li>For now the action does not support all of the variety of values for Node.js version files. The action can handle values according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node#supported-version-syntax\">documentation</a> and values with <code>v</code> prefix (<code>v14</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - name: Setup node from node version file\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n    with:\n      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'\n  - run: npm install\n  - run: npm test\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Update actions/cache dependency to 1.0.8 version.</h2>\n<p>We updated actions/cache dependency to the latest version (1.0.8). For more information please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md\">toolkit/cache</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add &quot;cache-hit&quot; output</h2>\n<p>This release introduces a new output: <code>cache-hit</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/327\">#327</a>).</p>\n<p>The <code>cache-hit</code> output contains boolean value indicating that an exact match was found for the key. It shows that the action uses already existing cache or not. The output is available only if cache is enabled.</p>\n<h2>Support caching for mono repos and repositories with complex structure</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/305\">#305</a>).</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (<code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code>) in the repository root. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories. This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<p>Yaml example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yml\"><code>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

      "I did some refactoring to make the code better readable.\r\nUnfortunately this made the PR more complicated to read..\r\n\r\nHere a tl:dr of what the code change does:\r\n\r\nDropping events decision before:\r\n1. first drop events by `sample_rate`\r\n1. then drop events that are in `ignore_errors` config option.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow changed to dropping events decision like this:\r\n1. first drop events that are in `ignore_errors` config option\r\n1. then drop events by `sample_rate` \r\n\r\nAfter events where dropped (or not dropped) the sessions are counted here:\r\nhttps://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/client.py#L344\r\n(a couple of lines above this the `_should_capture()` is called (that does the dropping decisions mentioned above)\r\n\r\nThe idea (not yet reflected in code) is now that we do not do the dropping first for all events and then update the sessions. But do the session update right before an event is dropped by sample_rate. \r\n\r\nSo that all events that are not  dropped are counted in sessions and also events that where dropped because of the sample rate are counted in the sessions.",
      "@antonpirker the way I understood what we're planning to do is different from what you describe here:\r\n> The idea (not yet reflected in code) is now that we do not do the dropping first for all events and then update the sessions. But do the session update right before an event is dropped by sample_rate.\r\n\r\nEvents dropped by `before_send` or `event_processor` should still not have an effect on session counts. So it's not just a matter of putting the session update a bit earlier in the code.",
      "Ok, so in the `_prepare_event()` the `before_send` and `event_processor` events are dropped:\r\nhttps://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/client.py#L336\r\n\r\nSo if events are dropped in `_prepare_event()`, they should not be counted as sessions.\r\n\r\nSo the solution would be to move the \"sample rate dropping code\" out of `_should_capture()` and put it after the call to `_prepare_event()` and before the call to `_update_session_from_event`.\r\n\r\nThis way we do all the \"dropping events\" stuff first (based on `ignored_errors` option, `before_send`, `event_processor`, recursion prevention.) and the those events still left will be counted towards the sessions and will be then dropped by `sample_rate` (and if dropped by `sample_rate`, they will still be counted towards the session.\r\n\r\nIs this the behavior this should have?\r\n",
      "The initial consensus only specified moving `ignored_errors` before the `sample_rate` check. If we also move `before_send` and `event_processors` we should discuss implications of that and if we are OK with them.\r\n\r\nThings to consider:\r\n* For `before_send` and `event_processors` we can't be certain why a developer dropped the event, so we don't really know whether to count a dropped event or not. My guess is this doesn't really matter since it might be wrong either way (whether we sample before or after).\r\n* Are we OK with `before_send` and `event_processors` being executed for every event where we previously only applied it to sampled events (i.e. events not dropped due to sampling). In other SDKs both can be provided by the developers so we can't predict what exactly they're doing. They might have adjusted their sample rate for a good tradeoff regarding performance and now it would execute more often.",
      "Ok. Now I got it. Thanks for clarification.\r\n\r\nSo I think we can safely deploy this change here because it does not break anything.\r\n\r\nI think we should discuss `before_send` and `event_processors` in a separate issue/pr"

      "@Fofanko if this really fixes the problem, happy to merge it in, but I'm trying to fully understand where the threading problem actually lies.\r\n\r\nIn the original stacktrace on the linked issue, the error occurs in `_after_cursor_execute`, so it seems the `ctx_mgr` variable on `conn` is being acted on by multiple threads, and so the `conn` itself is being used across threads.\r\n\r\nFrom the [`Connection` documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Connection)\r\n\r\n> The Connection object is not thread-safe. While a Connection can be shared among threads using properly synchronized access, it is still possible that the underlying DBAPI connection may not support shared access between threads.

This feels a little bit unstable to check for \"%s\" in the message\r\n\r\nMaybe the intent isn’t clear here, but the check for “%s” is important to this change. Even before this change, logged warnings were always captured by the Sentry SDK — however they are grouped under a single issue due to “%s” **always** being the logged string and the actual message being the first arg (this behavior is within CPython’s logging library). I changed that behavior in an approved change to CPython itself, but this change is a workaround for Python versions that won’t have that change since it likely won’t be backported.",

      "Just to get this right:\r\n* There are some options missing when creating a pool and/or a proxy here: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/transport.py#L436-L441\r\n* Because of the missing options sometimes it fails to send events to sentry backend.\r\n* @sliwinski-milosz added the options (that look indeed a little bit magical) and fixed the problem.\r\n* @sl0thentr0py would like to expose the same socket_options @sliwinski-milosz  creates but create them in `__init__()` and then give them to `self._make_pool(...)` on line 154 here: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/transport.py#L154-L159\r\n\r\nDo I get this right?",
      "> Because of the missing options sometimes it fails to send events to sentry backend.\r\n\r\nI would phrase it slightly differently. It is not because of missing options but because of specific scale behaviours/traffic distributions presumably that this fails. This is fairly non-trivial to repro because it is a low-level problem that only happens on certain systems of a certain size under a certain load distribution.\r\n\r\nThose magical values might work for certain systems but I do not know why precisely those values are selected. It is much better to leave this as a choice for the end-user than making those precise choices ourselves. If these were sane defaults, I would expect an upstream library (urllib3) to have incorporated them themselves, in which case we do not need this fix at all.\r\n\r\n",
      "@sl0thentr0py you have mentioned that you are aware of the issue. Does that mean you have seen it happening on your configurations? If yes, could you please provide more details?\r\n\r\nSo far I was able to reproduce it on `ubuntu:18.04` (Docker). As ERROR logging is disabled by default at the moment I don't know if it fails the same way on other configurations.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if at this stage we can assume that it affects only certain systems.\r\nThe urllib3 default values for pool worked fine for me for all other tools that I used so far. This makes me think that this issue is specific for Sentry. This is why I wouldn't expect urllib3 to have different default options - as maybe those don't apply to other cases.\r\nAlso, initially I raised the issue for the frontend hoping that something can be improved on their side.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the next steps are:\r\n1. Update the code to allow passing those additional socket options through parameter (configuration).\r\nThis is a safe update. It adds some flexibility and doesn't affect current users at all.\r\n2. Test extra options on multiple configuration where we face the issue.\r\n3. Try to find the configuration which is not affected by the issue (where we cannot reproduce it).\r\n\r\nIf it fails the same way on all systems and after testing it will turn out that the fix works properly - then I would use those extra options as default (still leaving the option to override them).\r\n\r\nLets check also if other sdk clients use the keep-alive option or not.\r\n\r\nShort term I think we should:\r\n1. Fix https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/1191 so people are aware if their integration is reliable.\r\n2. Allow passing extra socket options through configuration.\r\n3. Update documentation mentioning about the issue and possible solution (extra socket options through configuration).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nCould you please also help in fixing the failing `ci / lint (pull_request)` check? How can this be fixed?",
      "> Does that mean you have seen it happening on your configurations?\r\n\r\nNo I just meant the previous issues here.\r\n\r\n> Lets check also if other sdk clients use the keep-alive option or not.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any low level TCP settings in any of the other SDKs.\r\n\r\n> Could you please also help in fixing the failing ci / lint (pull_request) check? How can this be fixed?\r\n\r\nI don't think we'll be merging this PR in its current form. I think exposing `socket_options` is a better option here and I can make a PR next week or so with tests etc.\r\n\r\nTangentially, I'm still not convinced tweaking TCP settings is the right thing to do here. Network failures can happen due to whatever reason and that's not the abstraction layer the SDK should care about. What it should do is handle network failures gracefully/retry if possible etc. I will think more about this and see what to do here.",

    "body": "Granted, this is a bit of an edge-case, but I'll explain the rationale.\r\n\r\nIn our Django application, we define `MERCURIAL_TAG` in our settings. To compute this we subprocess out to `hg`. As you can imagine, this is quite expensive and has a significant impact on application startup time. So we've wrapped this in `django.utils.functional.lazy()` so that it's only evaluated when it's needed, not every time the app starts or every time a uwsgi worker is recycled.\r\n\r\nThe issue is, we primarily use this setting by passing it to `sentry_sdk.init()`. When the Sentry SDK goes to report an error, `compute_tracestate_value()` calls `json.dumps()` which blows up with a whole stack of `TypeError: Object of type __proxy__ is not JSON serializable` as the `_got_request_exception` signal fires over and over.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/193906/150870192-3ff59955-10f6-4ebf-ab6c-0eb66df917d0.png)\r\n\r\nI've added a `default=safe_str` to `json.dumps()` to make sure that whatever weird thing some random idiot (read: me) passes to to `sentry_sdk.init()` is properly converted to a string.\r\n\r\nI've left the type hint intact as `(typing.Mapping[str, str]) -> str` as it's probably worth maintaining the expectation that this is the case.",

Looks fine in principle but I'm not sure I understand your usage.\r\nI assume you pass that lazy function to `sentry_sdk.init(release=???)` somehow but I don't see how that would work in general. A lot of other things in the SDK also depend on that `release` config option being a string.",
      "@sl0thentr0py - You are correct, I'm using this lazy string for the `version` argument to `sentry_sdk.init()`. Remarkably, this seems to be the only place where this lazy string object affects things, though we don't use Sentry's performance product so there may be some code paths there I'm not exercising. It basically comes down to `json`'s `_iterencode` doing a bunch of `isinstance` checks while encoding. If you just blindly treat it as a string, it behaves just like a string. \r\n\r\nEg:\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: settings.MERCURIAL_REV\r\nOut[1]: 'da15c89d169f'\r\n\r\nIn [2]: type(settings.MERCURIAL_REV)\r\nOut[2]: django.utils.functional.lazy.<locals>.__proxy__\r\n\r\nIn [3]: \"one\" + settings.MERCURIAL_REV\r\nOut[3]: 'oneda15c89d169f'\r\n\r\nIn [4]: settings.MERCURIAL_REV.encode(\"utf-8\")\r\nOut[4]: b'da15c89d169f'\r\n\r\nIn [5]: isinstance(settings.MERCURIAL_REV, str)\r\nOut[5]: False\r\n```"

They have a dynamically resolved `urlconf` and set `ROOT_URLCONF` to an empty string which [breaks this `get_resolver`](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/urls/resolvers.py#L83) in Django.\r\n\r\nThis results in a silent exception when we try to [update the transaction name](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/2e18af218996cf9214c124457bc384976ed02921/sentry_sdk/integrations/django/__init__.py#L347) and hence they see `Generic WSGI request` for all their requests.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n* https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/urls/#how-django-processes-a-request\r\n* https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/middleware/\r\n* https://getsentry.atlassian.net/browse/WEB-530",

    "body": "_Background for anyone not familiar with Python's internal workings (skip ahead if you that's not you):_\r\n\r\n_Python handles memory deallocation through a combination of reference counting and cyclic garbage collection, the former taking way fewer resources than the latter. Having circular references forces the cyclic garbage collector to run, since anything involved in a reference cycle will never have a refcount of 0, even once everything _outside_ of the cycle is done with all of its members. The `gc` module used in the test mentioned below is a window specifically into the cyclic garbage collector part of the memory deallocation system, and its `collect` method returns the number of objects it was forced to deal with. See https://devguide.python.org/garbage_collector/ and https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html?highlight=gc#module-gc for more info._\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThere are currently a few places in the SDK where we have circular references:\r\n\r\n1) Transaction -> span recorder -> spans including transaction itself\r\n2) Child span -> span recorder -> spans including child span itself\r\n3) Transaction -> span recorder -> spans -> containing transaction\r\n4) In `serializer.py`, `_serialize_node()` -> `_serialize_node_impl()` -> `_serialize_node()`, making each a closure for the other.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses points 1-3*, by making the following changes:\r\n\r\n1) Transaction -> span recorder -> spans ~including transaction itself~\r\n    Transactions are no longer added to their own span recorders. (The SDK doesn't ever use the fact that they're there, and they're stripped out before the event is sent to Sentry.)\r\n\r\n2) ~Child span ->~ span recorder -> spans including child span itself\r\n    Child spans no longer have their own span recorder pointer, and instead access the recorder through their containing transaction.\r\n\r\n3) Transaction ~-> span recorder -> spans -> containing transaction~\r\n    When a transaction ends, after it harvests any completed spans, it now jettisons its link to its span recorder before it (the transaction) goes out of scope.\r\n\r\nIt also adds to/modifies tests covering all three scenarios\r\n\r\n\\*Point 4, which we only discovered in the process of fixing 1-3, concerns a different system than the rest, and therefore will need to be fixed in a separate PR.

More work needs to be done to investigate whether the final transaction name can be set earlier in any/all of the frameworks where this poses a problem.

For reference:\r\n\r\n    Tracestate data:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n        \"trace_id\": \"12312012123120121231201212312012\",\r\n        \"environment\": \"dogpark\",\r\n        \"release\": \"off.leash.park\",\r\n        \"public_key\": \"dogsarebadatkeepingsecrets\",\r\n        \"user\": {\"id\": 12312013, \"segment\": \"bigs\"},\r\n        \"transaction\": \"/interactions/other-dogs/new-dog/\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    `tracestate`  with without either: 196 characters\r\n    `tracestate` with user data: 256 characters\r\n    `tracestate` with transaction name: 264 characters\r\n    `tracestate` with both: 324 characters\r\n\r\n2) This data may change and/or get added to the scope after the tracestate value has been calculated, making it impossible to sample based on those attributes. This is especially a problem for transaction name, which in some frameworks isn't set to its final value until the transaction ends. This poses the added problem that the transaction name in its raw, un-finalized form may contain PII, because it is often the raw URL as opposed to the parameterized one (so, `/users/maisey/tricks/` rather than `/users/:username/tricks/`). More work needs to be done to investigate whether the final transaction name can be set earlier in any/all of the frameworks where this poses a problem. (For instance, it is a known problem in our Express integration, but not yet clear if it is a problem in any Python frameworks.)"

During the migration both Flask and FastAPI are available at the same time, sharing a lot of the code and tests.\r\n\r\nThe Flask app is currently deployed with Gevent, so the tests use Gevent's monkey patching.\r\n\r\nThe FastAPI app uses the `SentryAsgiMiddleware`, which internally uses `contextvars` to store and handle all the Sentry stuff per request. And that in turn uses this utility function to check if the current environment has working contextvars available.\r\n\r\nSo, with Python 3.7+ and a recent installation of Gevent monkey patching stuff, Sentry errors out complaining about broken contextvars, but it seems it's actually just a false positive.",

When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.\n\n\nYou have configured automerging on this repository. There is no automerging support in GitHub-native Dependabot, so these settings will not be added to the new config file.

Our celery tests depend on the `newrelic` package, which just hit v6, [dropping support for py3.5 in the process](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes/python-agent-600154). Fortunately, since the celery tests are the only thing which uses the package, it was possible to move it out of the general test requirements and into celery-specific requirements in tox, allowing py3.5 to use a different veresion of `newrelic` than other Python versions.\r\n\r\n2. Since version 2.0 (4 years ago), Django's `url` function has really [just been an alias](https://github.com/django/django/commit/df41b5a05d4e00e80e73afe629072e37873e767a#diff-318c25772a3e40b833969d2d1c3e1a6f9b2cd23c165bb155e5895c69deca83b6R12) for a new function, `re_path`.

    "body": "This PR is an initial implementation of the official `tracestate` spec (detailed [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-1/)), which specifies a multi-vendor, vendor-neutral method of propagating trace data between services. The basic format of a `tracestate` header is `vendor1=value1,vendor2=value2,vendor3=value3,...`.\r\n\r\n**Key Behaviors:**\r\n\r\n- When starting a transaction representing an incoming request*, the request's `tracestate` header is parsed, and Sentry and third-party portions are stored separately on the transaction\r\n- If no Sentry portion is found, or if a transaction is not being started from headers, a new Sentry `tracestate` value is calculated and stored on the transaction\r\n- Outgoing requests made while the transaction is open contain a `tracestate` header of the form `sentry=sentry_value,vendor1=value1,vendor2=value2` (in other words, wherever the Sentry data was in the incoming list, it's moved to be the first entry)\r\n- Transactions (and errors with attachments** sent while a transaction is open) include data from Sentry's `tracestate` value in their envelope headers\r\n\r\n\\* Now that there's more than one header, the `from_traceparent` method mentioned in an older version of [our tracing spec](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/) (since replaced by `from_sentrytrace` in the spec, but not the SDK) is deprecated in favor of two new helper functions called from `continue_from_headers`.\r\n\\** Error events with attachments just because those are the only ones currently sent in envelopes.\r\n\r\n**Sentry's `tracestate` Value:**\r\n\r\n- The value in the HTTP header is the result of taking data of the form `{ \"trace_id\": ... , \"release\": ... , \"environment\": ... , \"public_key\": ... }`, base64-encoding it, and stripping off any trailing `=`. (`release` and `environment` reflect the values set in `sentry_sdk.init()`, and `public_key` comes from the part of the DSN between the `https://` and the `@xxx.ingest.sentry.io`.)\r\n- The value in the envelope header is that same data, but without any encoding.\r\n\r\n**Known Limitations:**\r\n\r\nCompared to the spec, this does not handle:\r\n\r\n- Multiple incoming `tracestate` headers\r\n- Incoming third-party values which are empty (not not-there, but rather empty like the second entry in `x=y,,z=w`)\r\n- Whitespace in the incoming `tracestate` header value\r\n- Limiting the length of either the Sentry `tracestate` value or the overall `tracestate` header\r\n\r\nIt also does not consume, create, or propagate `traceparent` headers. (We continue to use our own similar `sentry-trace` header.)\r\n\r\n**Follow-up Tasks**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Decide if we like the new `continue_from_headers`/helper function model, and update dev docs\r\n- [ ] Decide which, if any, of the known limitations listed above are worth fixing\r\n- [ ] Update JS SDK to consume incoming `tracestate` headers and handle third-party `tracestate` values\r\n- [ ] Sort out whether and how to include end-user data",

It's important to publish layer to every region the user might want because layer region and lambda function region must match.\n\nTo run the publish script, it's required to set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables that `boto3` library understands.\n\nFor each Python version, publish-script prints a list of obtained ARNs. Having an ARN for the region, user could just paste it in the settings and the package will be available to the runtime.\n\nSo it's necessary to put the list with latest ARNs somewhere in documentation.",

The `_is_databag()` helper function wasn't adjusted accordingly, however, resulting in `MAX_DATABAG_BREADTH` being applied to the list of breadcrumbs rather than the data inside each breadcrumb itself. In practice, this meant that no event could have more than 10 breadcrumbs.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the check in `_is_databag()` to look one level deeper for breadcrumbs.

A test that creates 1m items takes 10 seconds to terminate, going much lower than 10m makes the test flaky (in the sense that the bug is not hit every time)\r\n\r\nThe concern about RLock-vs-signals is not important as it only happens with the Python impl of RLock, and we have not been able to repro any of this with signals either, so I suppose it's harder to hit.\r\n\r\nAlternate proposal would be to use `gc.callbacks` to figure out when GC is running, and disable event submission in those situations. Armin's concern was that gc.callbacks may run too often and us hooking into it is likely a performance issue.\r\n\r\nsqlalchemy's workaround has been working since forever, so that speaks for that",

The default for search list behavior can be set at in the resolver object with the <code>use_search_by_default</code> parameter. The default is False.</li>\n<li>DNS-over-TLS is supported with <code>dns.query.tls()</code>.</li>\n<li>DNS-over-HTTPS is supported with <code>dns.query.https()</code>, and the resolver will use DNS-over-HTTPS for a nameserver which is an HTTPS URL.</li>\n<li>Basic query and resolver support for the Trio, Curio, and asyncio asynchronous I/O libraries has been added in <code>dns.asyncquery</code> and <code>dns.asyncresolver</code>. This API should be viewed as experimental as asynchronous I/O support in dnspython is still evolving.</li>\n<li>TSIG now defaults to using SHA-256.</li>\n<li>Basic type info has been added to some functions.

    "body": "Having the sentry integration enabled with Sanic results in a 10x reduction in requests per second to `@app.exception` routes, even when those route exceptions are ignored.\r\n\r\nThe main function we're trying to avoid is `exceptions_from_error_tuple`, as illustrated in the flamegraph in #650. In a relatively simple world, the sentry-python package shouldn't execute anything if the error is in the `ignored_exceptions`.\r\n\r\nIdeally this change would live inside of `event_from_exception` [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/b7679a50f31ef63614da21a6ecda9e4ff43a5754/sentry_sdk/utils.py#L671), but I wasn't sure what would happen in the scenario that either no exception was returned or a mock exception was returned.\r\n\r\nIn theory every integration should ignore the exception passed back from `event_from_exception` and simply use the `hint` to assess whether or not `_should_capture_exception`, but since `hint` has a default value of `{}` it's possible that some cases might not actually be passing the `hint` correctly.\r\n\r\nFixes #650 \r\n\r\nTLDR: This fixes it for Sanic. It would be nice to fix this generally, but I don't have enough context to know whether the change is safe.",

Generally it's nice if people have to think about as little as possible (so, not about which integrations are necessary) when enabling the SDK.\r\n\r\nThe semver compatibility is another thing. Yes, you could upgrade to a new version of the SDK and just get more integrations enabled automatically. Similar effects were already observable to some degree as we added more features to integrations that the user already explicitly enabled (breadcrumbs for django sql queries for example). I think we will just avoid this problem and make sure that new integrations or changes to existing ones don't break fundamental things like grouping, ever (like we already do)"

(1478)</li>\n<li>Remove code that issued deprecation warnings in version 0.15. (1477)</li>\n<li>Remove most top-level attributes provided by the <code>werkzeug</code> module in favor of direct imports. For example, instead of <code>import werkzeug; werkzeug.url_quote</code>, do <code>from werkzeug.urls import url_quote</code>. Install version 0.16 first to see deprecation warnings while upgrading. 2, 1640</li>\n<li>Added <code>utils.invalidate_cached_property()</code> to invalidate cached properties. (1474)</li>\n<li>Directive keys for the <code>Set-Cookie</code> response header are not ignored when parsing the <code>Cookie</code> request header. This allows cookies with names such as &quot;expires&quot; and &quot;version&quot;. (1495)</li>\n<li>Request cookies are parsed into a <code>MultiDict</code> to capture all values for cookies with the same key. <code>cookies[key]</code> returns the first value rather than the last. Use <code>cookies.getlist(key)</code> to get all values. <code>parse_cookie</code> also defaults to a <code>MultiDict</code>. 1562, 1458</li>\n<li>Add <code>charset=utf-8</code> to an HTTP exception response's <code>CONTENT_TYPE</code> header. (1526)</li>\n<li>The interactive debugger handles outer variables in nested scopes such as lambdas and comprehensions. 913, 1037, 1532</li>\n<li>The user agent for Opera 60 on Mac is correctly reported as &quot;opera&quot; instead of &quot;chrome&quot;. 1556</li>\n<li>The platform for Crosswalk on Android is correctly reported as &quot;android&quot; instead of &quot;chromeos&quot;. (1572)</li>\n<li>Issue a warning when the current server name does not match the configured server name. 760</li>\n<li>A configured server name with the default port for a scheme will match the current server name without the port if the current scheme matches. 1584</li>\n<li>~exceptions.InternalServerError has a <code>original_exception</code> attribute that frameworks can use to track the original cause of the error. 1590</li>\n<li>Headers are tested for equality independent of the header key case, such that <code>X-Foo</code> is the same as <code>x-foo</code>. 1605</li>\n<li>http.dump_cookie accepts <code>'None'</code> as a value for <code>samesite</code>. 1549</li>\n<li>~test.Client.set_cookie accepts a <code>samesite</code> argument. 1705</li>\n<li>Support the Content Security Policy header through the Response.content_security_policy data structure. 1617</li>\n<li><code>LanguageAccept</code> will fall back to matching &quot;en&quot; for &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;en-US&quot; for &quot;en&quot; to better support clients or translations that only match at the primary language tag. 450, 1507</li>\n<li><code>MIMEAccept</code> uses MIME parameters for specificity when matching. 458, 1574</li>\n<li>If the development server is started with an <code>SSLContext</code> configured to verify client certificates, the certificate in PEM format will be available as <code>environ[&quot;SSL_CLIENT_CERT&quot;]</code>. 1469</li>\n<li><code>is_resource_modified</code> will run for methods other than <code>GET</code> and <code>HEAD</code>, rather than always returning <code>False</code>. 409</li>\n<li><code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> returns 404 rather than 500 when trying to access a directory instead of a file with the package loader. The dependency on setuptools and pkg_resources is removed. 1599</li>\n<li>Add a <code>response.cache_control.immutable</code> flag. Keep in mind that browser support for this <code>Cache-Control</code> header option is still experimental and may not be implemented. 1185</li>\n<li>Optional request log highlighting with the development server is handled by Click instead of termcolor. 1235</li>\n<li>Optional ad-hoc TLS support for the development server is handled by cryptography instead of pyOpenSSL. 1555</li>\n<li><code>FileStorage.save()</code> supports <code>pathlib</code> and 519 <code>PathLike</code> objects. 1653</li>\n<li>The debugger security pin is unique in containers managed by Podman. 1661</li>\n<li>Building a URL when <code>host_matching</code> is enabled takes into account the current host when there are duplicate endpoints with different hosts. 488</li>\n<li>The <code>429 TooManyRequests</code> and <code>503 ServiceUnavailable</code> HTTP exceptions takes a <code>retry_after</code> parameter to set the <code>Retry-After</code> header. 1657</li>\n<li><code>Map</code> and <code>Rule</code> have a <code>merge_slashes</code> option to collapse multiple slashes into one, similar to how many HTTP servers behave. This is enabled by default. 1286, 1694</li>\n<li>Add HTTP 103, 208, 306, 425, 506, 508, and 511 to the list of status codes. 1678</li>\n<li>Add <code>update</code>, <code>setlist</code>, and <code>setlistdefault</code> methods to the <code>Headers</code> data structure. <code>extend</code> method can take <code>MultiDict</code> and kwargs. 1687, 1697</li>\n<li>The development server accepts paths that start with two slashes, rather than stripping off the first path segment. 491</li>\n<li>Add access control (Cross Origin Request Sharing, CORS) header properties to the <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code> wrappers. 1699</li>\n<li><code>Accept</code> values are no longer ordered alphabetically for equal quality tags. Instead the initial order is preserved. 1686</li>\n<li>Added <code>Map.lock_class</code> attribute for alternative implementations. 1702</li>\n<li>Support matching and building WebSocket rules in the routing system, for use by async frameworks. 1709</li>\n<li>Range requests that span an entire file respond with 206 instead of 200, to be more compliant with 7233. This may help serving media to older browsers. 410, 1704</li>\n<li>The ~middleware.shared_data.SharedDataMiddleware default <code>fallback_mimetype</code> is <code>application/octet-stream</code>. If a filename looks like a text mimetype, the <code>utf-8</code> charset is added to it. This matches the behavior of ~wrappers.BaseResponse and Flask's <code>send_file()</code>. 1689</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Version 0.16.1</h1>\n<p>Released 2020-01-27</p>\n</tr></table> ...

As Mike says, you can leave Sentry, but you can never leave open-source.\r\n\r\nAlright so this PR primarily addresses #568, specifically the problem with initializing Sentry after creating a `SparkContext`\r\n\r\nProblem: When using Databricks shell (kinda like a running a Jupyter notebook on top of a Spark cluster), the SparkContext is already instantiated. This means that we can't monkey patch SparkContext init anymore.\r\n\r\nFix: I now check to see if an active spark context exists, if it does, I forgo monkeypatching the init and just use that active spark context\r\n```python\r\nsparkContext = SparkContext._active_spark_context\r\nif sparkContext:\r\n    _set_sentry_metadata(sparkContext)\r\nelse:\r\n    patch_spark_context_init()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, `patch_spark_context_init` patches spark's `_do_init` function -> https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/context.py#L129\r\n\r\ncc @kutny @andyzzhao",

    "body": "~This is draft PR for the purposes of reviewing the work I have so far. Much of this is still in flux, and has to be extensively tested on different executions env like Databricks/Dataproc/YARN.~\r\n\r\nWe make available the integration for both the Spark driver as well as Spark workers (which may be in different clusters depending on the execution environment). In order to add the sentry-integration, you must install the `sentry-sdk`. \r\n\r\nIn order to start sending Sentry errors from the main Spark driver, you can simply init Sentry before you init your `SparkContext` when writing your job.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport sentry_sdk\r\nfrom sentry_sdk.integrations.spark import SparkIntegration\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    sentry_sdk.init(\"___PUBLIC_DSN___\", integrations=[SparkIntegration()])\r\n    spark = SparkSession\\\r\n        .builder\\\r\n        .appName(\"ExampleApp\")\\\r\n        .getOrCreate()\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also just use `StreamingContext` in case of SparkStreaming usage or just use `SparkContext`.\r\n\r\nThis will log errors to Sentry, building breadcrumbs using \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/SparkListener.scala#L216\r\n\r\nIn order to instrument workers, additional steps will have to be taken. The configuration options used to instrument the workers are only available in Spark 2.4 and above.\r\n\r\nFirst, you must install the `sentry-sdk` on your workers. This can be done locally be sending the `sentry-python` egg or zip to spark using the `--py-files` cmd line option or with `sc.addPyFile()`.\r\n\r\nNext, we have to monkey patch the spark daemon to initialize Sentry on each worker. This can be done by creating a file with the following code. \r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport sentry_sdk\r\nfrom sentry_sdk.integrations.spark import SparkWorkerIntegration\r\nimport pyspark.daemon as original_daemon\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    sentry_sdk.init(\"___PUBLIC_DSN___\", integrations=[SparkWorkerIntegration()])\r\n    original_daemon.manager()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to tell Spark to replace the daemon, you must set some properties, either with a custom `SparkConf` or using the `--conf` cmd line option. These are `spark.python.use.daemon=true` and `spark.python.daemon.module=sentry_patched_worker_file_name`. You must also use `--py-files` to send `sentry_patched_worker_file_name.py` to each of the workers.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/api/python/PythonWorkerFactory.scala#L56-L63\r\n\r\nBoth the workers and drivers share a common `application_id`, so we can easily filter for which workers are associated with what drivers.\r\n\r\nNext Steps:\r\n- ~Test with Databricks~\r\n- ~Test with Dataproc~\r\n- ~Write tests on this branch~\r\n- ~Update documentation~ https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/pull/1275",

(:issue:`1080`)\n> -   Restore the ``response`` argument to :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized`.\n>     (:pr:`1527`)\n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` doesn't add the ``WWW-Authenticate``\n>     header if ``www_authenticate`` is not given. (:issue:`1516`)\n> -   The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather\n>     than representing them with ``b''``. (:issue:`1502`)\n> -   Fix the filename format string in\n>     :class:`~middleware.profiler.ProfilerMiddleware` to correctly handle\n>     float values. (:issue:`1511`)\n> -   Update :class:`~middleware.lint.LintMiddleware` to work on Python 3.\n>     (:issue:`1510`)\n> -   The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time\n>     out in that case. (:issue:`1536`)\n> -   When running the development server in Docker, the debugger security\n>     pin is now unique per container.\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.2\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-04-02\n> \n> -   ``Rule`` code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore.\n>     The previous value, \"generated\", was causing coverage to fail.\n>     (:issue:`1487`)\n> -   The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted\n>     cookies. This fixes an issue introduced in 0.15.0 where the cookies\n>     from the original request were used for redirects, causing functions\n>     such as logout to fail. (:issue:`1491`)\n> -   The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app, to\n>     prevent in-place modifications from affecting redirect requests.\n>     (:issue:`1498`)\n> -   The ``\"werkzeug\"`` logger only adds a handler if there is no handler\n>     configured for its level in the logging chain. This avoids double\n>     logging if other code configures logging first. (:issue:`1492`)\n> \n> \n> Version 0.15.1\n> --------------\n> \n> Released 2019-03-21\n> \n> -   :exc:`~exceptions.Unauthorized` takes ``description`` as the first\n></tr></table> ...

Here is an integration for exactly that. The testcase is ripped straight from https://sentry.io/organizations/sentry/issues/856036064\r\n\r\nClickHouse calls [`backtrace_symbols`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/backtrace_symbols). It already returns a formatted string/list of strings. ClickHouse then parses this string and [replaces symbols with demangled versions](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/1e22b308d9cd974803920c90d968ca89ad36c84f/dbms/src/Common/StackTrace.cpp). I didn't bother with parsing addresses and offsets as I don't see much value in that information (not sure if it's used in grouping) and some of those return addresses (brackets at the end) seem wrong:\r\n\r\n```\r\n23. clickhouse-server() [0xa3c68cf]\r\n24. /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0(+0x8184) [0x7fdb108c5184]\r\n25. /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(clone+0x6d) [0x7fdb0fee003d]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm open to alternative naming suggestions. As far as I can tell this function has its origins in glibc. `LibExecInfoBacktraceIntegration` seemed bulky. Perhaps `GlibcBacktraceIntegration` to avoid conflict with GDB's output format, which seems entirely different? I'm generally unsure of `backtrace_symbols`'s origin. It seems to have started as a glibc thing but there are ports for BSD and Darwin. It isn't POSIX though.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing the idea of this with @mitsuhiko there was the idea to have a single `NativeStacktraceIntegration` where we would add new kinds of stacktrace formats over time. However, in order to not break grouping between minor versions, we can't actually add new variants to that \"super-integration\" without having the user explicitly opt into each of them (just the same reason why we can't make this a default integration). Therefore I see no point in having one integration for multiple formats, and the naming problem persists.\r\n\r\ncc @alex-hofsteede",

Clearly the code can leak quite badly if used in a project with code generation, but in general the set of tracebacks should be small.\r\n\r\nNote this can be quite awkward as Sentry doesn't really have a means of searching for a capture with locals, though one can normally just hunt backwards for the first instance.",

An example of this, is a case where a client request to a websocket route causes an `InvalidHandshake` exception which in turn, is handled by sanic to raise an `InvalidUsage` exception. These exceptions, if a handler is registered explicitly in the application, should not create an issue event as this can lead to a large number of events generated for a heavily used websocket endpoint. Additionally, in any such scenarios an event can be captured by either explicitly using a `capture_message` or initializing the  logging integration and logging an error.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change retains capturing any errors that may be encountered during the error handler execution.\r\n",
