      "I tried to ask GPT but it couldn't figure out what was wrong. It did suggest to ensure the component exists in Java and it wasn't being removed. I also asked if it matters if I call the super method at the end of the beginning and it said:\r\n\r\n> * Calling super.method() at the beginning: This is useful when you want the behavior of the superclass method to execute first, followed by additional functionality specific to the subclass. This approach ensures that the superclass behavior is preserved and then extended upon.\r\n\r\n> * Calling super.method() at the end: Conversely, placing the call to super.method() at the end allows the subclass to execute its functionality first, followed by the behavior of the superclass method. This is helpful when you want to ensure that the subclass's behavior takes precedence over that of the superclass.\r\n\r\nSo based on the stack trace it just seemed like it was needing to run here after everything else was done and I just tried it out. This seemed easier than a larger refactor. I'm not sure the behavior difference. I was looking through the code for Enclosure and I think this might have been it where there was actually a bug in wicket versions before 7 where the configure method wasn't called, and now when it was called early it didn't work. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/wicket/commit/c97e3f4b0e7c7300c41d4608547d8bd16f37498f\r\n\r\nPossibly doing some splitting and having some of this in the `onInitialize` would also work but I've tested this out and didn't see any problems. \r\n\r\nThere's also an error thrown if you don't call the `super.onBeforeRender()` at all, but as long as you call it it's all good. I don't see any advice on where/when to call it but it does seems to make a difference."

      "These were on https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/issues/SAK-33238\r\n\r\nFrom Wicket 7 on they dropped these tree classes and just have the new AbstractTree that has a NestedTree and TableTree.\r\n\r\n> The old Tree component in wicket-extensions is removed.\r\n> It was based on Swing APIs and many people complained about this. Use the new Tree component introduced in Wicket 6.0.0 instead.\r\n\r\nI believe that TreeTable needed to be converted to one of these. I'm not sure what LinkTree would migrate to maybe NestedTree. It also needed to implement TreeModelProvider. \r\n\r\nI worked on it in 2017 and didn't finish it and didn't get it to work both because I didn't know how Delegated Access fully worked (especially features like the shopping cart) and I also didn't know Wicket enough. I'd have liked to develop a Wicket tool from scratch.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/compare/master...jonespm:DAC-81-treemodel\r\n\r\nThough It _looks_ like someone may have forked this old tree to support the more modern versions of Wicket?

Maybe if that does work it would allow it to more easily upgrade but ideally these components would be migrated.\r\n\r\nhttps://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.wicketstuff/wicket15-tree \r\nhttps://github.com/wicketstuff/wicket1.5-tree."

The approach I took was to add a new parameter “mergeOverride” that the Grader code could explicitly invoke to solve this issue without breaking some other scenario (which I don’t know if such exists, but erring on the side of caution I thought it might).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the introduction of ‘mergeOverride’ exposed another bug where the “grade” value that would be returned is not formatted for displaying to users. I remove this logic (lines 682-685), given that it seems redundant based on the if-else conditional immediately preceding it (unless there’s something subtle here that I’m missing).\r\n\r\nGiven my aforementioned caution regarding scenarios to preserve (i.e., where ‘mergeOverride’ should indeed remain ‘true’), I assume that adding a unit test regarding this and other cases would be warranted. I did not attempt that here but others are more than welcome to push a commit here that would take care of that.\r\n\r\nFinally, I made two fixes here to Grader’s text field. The “id” attribution should be conditional, displaying only for the Grade field, and not also for the grade override fields. Also, I repaired the “class” attribute such that the value of “points-input” will actually render in the DOM for the Grade field. This is important for decreasing that field’s width; otherwise, for peer evaluations, the info popover icon is forced to a new line/row.",

It scares me because I don't understand it. And it seems to touch lots of code. Will it be maintained going forward?\r\n\r\nNote that I also revert a bit of code from Fernando in SAK-47090 Test & Quizzes - Set a bigger number of students in Sakai Pager and set it as default selected value (#10374).

From what I see the only \"revert\" you do is getting rid of the boolean param, but I'm not 100% sure why? Does it fail with it? We can test an alternative proposed solution but just removing that bit is not ideal.\r\n\r\nI also added Jesus as a reviewer as he might know more about Fernando's changes.",

We can test an alternative proposed solution but just removing that bit is not ideal.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look. getAllAgents() is only called once in this new PR code. So there is no real need for the boolean param. I don't know how to test Dynamics Rubrics. Can you have someone test it or let me know how to test it? ",
      "Thing is the questionScores method inside getAllAgents uses that param too and it was the main reason for that override. It was introduced for a specific case within the dynamic rubrics, not sure what would happen now with your change. Let me think about it and I'll come back to you, hopefully we can find a middle point that supports it all. We can do the testing related to S2U-5 ourselves but hopefully we can find a way of solving this without breaking that feature. (We can do a demo of sorts at some point in the future, but I guess it's not worth it for you to delve deeper into it right now.)\r\n\r\nAlso on 22.x you won't find that param, so it might be one of those \"different PR for each version\" situations while we're discussing this...\r\n",

Splitting that between site for permissions and group for gb instance was the hardest bit, deciding where would fit one value or the other on each of the dozens of methods and hundreds of calls.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this development was limited to providing group support to the gradebook tool, but we're already in talks to follow this work for external integrations (assignments, samigo, content-review, webservices, lti...). For that reason we created this different jira:\r\nhttps://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-49493\r\n\r\nThe comments about using the same parameter twice is to keep those integrations working as before (gradebook site instances), while moving the code closer to the future version. Gradebookng has lots and lots of similar methods receiving different arguments, called from many different places and doing similar things but not always the same. That was hard to read and to maintain, so I tried to leave it ready so whoever gets other pieces of work doesn't have to go through that process again.\r\n\r\n",

Anyway, I see two alternatives to this fix that might be unnoticed by the user:\r\n1. Update the data that is used to render the criterions by sorting it based on `sortedIds`.\r\n2. Fetch the sorted criterions again from the backend.\r\n\r\nI would think lit would just update the dom then, based on the new order and things should work. If the confusion of lit goes deeper though, could you clarify more or less what is happening please?",

In the render method you see that the criteria list has been updated with one less after the delete, but the dom is not updated accordingly. It seems that once sortable has moved things around, lit loses awareness of it. The deleted criterion effectively becomes detached.",

It has a lot of different Codecs in it so we could use this in other places. https://github.com/f4b6a3/uuid-creator/wiki/4.0.-Library-codecs#base-62-format\r\n- https://github.com/f4b6a3/uuid-creator",
      "@jonespm , the problem with most Base62 encoders is that they are used for \"longs\" in UUID serialization.   Few actually do string-to-string-back-to-string encoding.  And I do not want to add another dependency to something that receives less open source support than Sakai.  I do not want to repeat the GenericDAO, RSF, reflectutils ... folly.  If you think 15 lines of code in our code base is tech debt, a dependency maintained by a person who has not touched their code in several years - that is real tech debt.",
      "@ern I checked if the java.util.Base-64 url-safe encoding was safe for double encoding - it was not.  I will add a unit test to verify this now and in the future.   I also wrote a unit test to use io.jsonwebtoken.io.Base64 which we both noticed did not add padding and is why JWTs are safe for double URL encoding.  But alas,  the jjwt-api authors fear their fork of Base64 escaping the lab and so made it protected so it is only usable in class-siblings.   I am guessing they did not want anyone mistakenly using it as a generic Base64, being interoperable, and then being later criticised. Methinks they would have been smarter to use Base62 with string method signatures and then making it public so I could have used it :)  I would have loved to be a fly on the while as the jjwt folks debated how to be super safe w.r.t URLs given that there is a Java built in \"safe\" encoder already and an RFC that perfectly demonstrates something that is \"98.4375 percent safe\".",
      "I just offered a few packages as Earle had made the suggestion. I'm fine with what's here but I also generally prefer trying to find a maintained library over adding code that one of us mght have to fix a bug in someday. \r\n\r\nThis has unit tests and I don't have time to test an alternative so seems fine to me.

The default number of announcements is set to a large number (again copied from the home -> dashboard logic) so that **all** viewable announcements should be shown... with paging.

I also believe that switching to `org.apache.http.client.HttpClient` instead of `java.net.http.HttpClient` and using their `response.getHeaders(\"Link\")` [might also be using this same library](https://github.com/apache/httpcomponents-client/blob/9748d1baf825fa525d9dea37fec266d2bda39cc1/httpclient5/src/main/java/org/apache/hc/client5/http/impl/classic/ContentCompressionExec.java#L161C1-L162C1) and produce an expected response.",
      "So @jonespm - I tried both the 4.x and 5.x `BasicHeaderValueParser` and they are both pretty lame.  Their use case is for headers that look like this:\r\n\r\n`param1=value1; param2=value2; param3=value3`\r\n\r\nWhen presented any kind of link header with pretty intricate rules about separators, url encoding, etc, both of these libraries fall flat and get 100% lost and can't even do the basic stuff that Java does until it meets the Canvas variant of the header.\r\n\r\nI dove into the code thinking that to avoid the dreaded regex, I would do some ad hoc parsing.   I started to rough it out and figured that a simple regex is a clearer and safer path.  I suggest merging as it.\r\n\r\nparam1=value1; param2=value2; param3=value3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "This code was written way back in 2012. It was originally contrib'd along with the other joinable site settings in SAK-24423, but the join notification email aspect was rejected at that time due to a cyclical dependency. Now that `EmailTemplateService` has been moved into kernel, we're able to stop sitting on this as a local modification.\r\n\r\nDespite this code working well and not having issues in 10+ years, we have not gone back to refactor this code at all, and it could very well use some updating. However, we have not been given resources to update this code for contribution.\r\n\r\nAs for the new `getUserSites` method, I'm also assuming it's needed but I haven't looked into it further than porting the code. Unfortunately I'm still not able to put resources towards modifying this PR, but if someone wants to make edits, feel free to do so.\r\n\r\nThere also seems to be some support/interest in this feature on the JIRA ticket itself."

    "body": "This proposed PR revises the auto-pinning behavior introduced with [SAK-48809](https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-48809) such that auto-pinning would behave like the auto-favorites behavior before Trinity, except that auto-favoriting / auto-pinning would be enabled for all users (instead of controlled per user preference before Sakai 23). The test plan in [SAK-48948](https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-48948) has been revised to clarify distinctive changes to be fixed with this PR.  What's key though and not necessarily clear in the test plan is that this PR: a) auto-pins sites for instructors regardless of the published/unpublished state of the site, and b) honors unpinning events for all users by not re-pinning sites a user has explicitly unpinned.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in order to retain user preferences when a user unfavorites / unpins a site-- while forgoing continued reliance on XML parsing for this-- I’ve transposed the autoFavoritesSeenSites user preference from SAKAI_PREFRENCES.XML to a new boolean HAS_BEEN_UNPINNED added to the PINNED_SITES table. By default this value is set to false and-- with one exception described below--- is only set to true when a user explicitly unpins a site. The user can subsequently re-pin the site, which toggles the value back to false.\r\n\r\nWhen a site is unpinned, its corresponding POSITION value is set to -1 (whereas positive integers signify an actual position in the site navigation). Logic in PinnedSiteRepositoryImpl and PortalServiceImpl has been accordingly revised to distinguish pinned from unpinned records, distinguished primarily by the hasBeenUnpinned field of the PinnedSite class. \r\n\r\nThe above change to the database schema assumes that the Quartz job described in [SAK-48700](https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-48700) (or a subsequent refinement of it, depending on timing) may accommodate the transfer of autoFavoritesSeenSites values to corresponding PINNED_SITES records when migrating user’s favorite sites to pinned sites. A crucial addendum would be to transcribe sites in the Sites drawer (i.e., non-hidden sites) that are not favorites to have records in PINNED_SITES with HAS_BEEN_UNPINNED set to true; this would prevent all such sites from displaying as pinned sites in the site navigation, which could be in the dozens or even hundreds for some instructors.\r\n\r\nFinally while working on this PR, I observed a new bug affecting the PortalServiceImpl.update method for the handling of EVENT_SITE_PUBLISH (i.e., site.publish). At some recent point between the release of [SAK-48809](https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-48809) and now, e.getContext returns null whereas it used to return the siteId-- at least this was so at the time of the release of SAK-48809. (This behavor is evident in trunk on nightly.) Investigating this further, I observe that the null event context seems to be derived from the current placement’s being null (e.g., returned from ToolComponent.getCurrentPlacement). Though I’m not sure why this is now occurring for (only?) publishing events, I’ve adapted the event handling code in PortalServiceImpl.update to check for a null context and to otherwise parse e.getResource to obtain the siteId. The latter proves to be what is allowing publish events to actually create pinned site records for users. This issue is incorporated into the revised [SAK-48948](https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-48948) test plan.\r\n\r\n[SAK-48809]: https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-48809?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ\r\n[SAK-48948]: https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-48948?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ\r\n[SAK-48700]: https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-48700?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ",

To address this, we need to update the endpoint implementation to filter the submissions based on the access rights of the current user.\r\n\r\n1. The ```getSelectedGroupUsers()``` function has been modified to make it ```public``` and the last parameter type has been changed from ```List``` to ```List<User>```. This change ensures consistency across all usages of the function, as all the places where it is used already pass a ```List<User>``` as the last parameter. \r\n\r\n2. I use ```assignmentService.allowAddSubmissionUser()``` function to fetch the users who are allowed to submit. These users are the same as those displayed in the \"Submissions\" page of the Assignment, which is accessed by clicking the \"grade\" button. (Refer to the screenshot)\r\n\r\n3. Add a filter in ```getGradableForSite()``` to ensure that for the current assignment, the current user can only view submitters who are visible to them.\r\n\r\n4. Add a filter in ```getSubmitterGroupList()``` to ensure that for the group assignment, the current user can only view groups where they have the grading permission.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndividual assignment:\r\n<img width=\"1908\" alt=\"SAK-48969-local\" src=\"https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/assets/102482288/0d885151-e507-4567-af37-287bbdfeb412\">\r\n\r\nGroup assignment:\r\n<img width=\"1910\" alt=\"SAK-48969-local-group\" src=\"https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/assets/102482288/3e64e3de-184d-43b1-b578-c3a2c433850e\">\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So, 5 times less data, and half the http connections when grading. I've added a data loading screen so the user knows what's going on. Also, I've added paging so we can handle large class sizes. On the first load, only the skeletons of the submissions are fetched, apart from the selected submission, which is hydrated together with one either side of it. As the user navigates using the next and previous buttons, the code looks ahead and hydrates the next two unhydrated submissions.",

However It should be the responsibility of the EntityManager to initiate the appropriate action (_EntityManager would need to be informed that such an action is happening likely by the SiteRemovalAdvisor_).\r\n\r\nSo in the end a few adjustments will be needed to properly reflect this chain of command.\r\n\r\nThank you for pointing this out!"

However, unlike ```getTasks()``` which correctly sets the URL, ```updateTask()``` does not, leading to the missing URL problem.\r\n\r\nI extracted some of codes in ```getTasks()``` and created a new function that handles the same logic used in ```getTasks()``` and ```updateTasks()```. This function is designed to ensure that all necessary information, including the URL, is properly updated when a user edits a task's details. By doing so, we were able to resolve the issue of missing URLs that occurred when using the ```updateTasks()``` function.",

      "@jonespm - Thank you for investigating this. What seems to have happened is that I have hidden.jsp in my working directory for work on trunk, but I somehow forgot to add the file to my commit for SAK-48567. The lines you've added in faces-config.xml are not reflected in my work; they technically do not seem to be needed-- I think the mapping already follows JSF's conventions-- but it makes sense to me to be explicit in faces-config in case those conventions ever change. ",
      "@hornersa Thanks! Yeah I didn't try it without the faces xml change but makes sense. It was there before and better to be explicit about it. \r\n\r\nI also removed the duplicate default config value which wasn't doing anything but just wasn't needed. \r\n\r\nThanks for checking. "

      "Thanks @alejandromf for the PR, I was reviewing this PR and I ended up checking it out and made some improvements. If you could give it a test that would be great I believe the NPE was in the method org.sakaiproject.component.section.sakai.SectionManagerImpl#getUserRoleFromSite\r\nThe bulk of the changes are just improvements as that method was pretty old",
      "Hello Earle. I'm sorry but it doesn't work. \r\nWhen getUserRoleFromSite() returns a null, then on line 1010 it does \"if (!(sakaiRoles.contains(userRole))\", it goes in here and throws a RoleConfigurationException stopping the for loop.\r\n\r\nIn my example the group had 12 students, when this happened it left the group with only 4.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35261980/228637591-2a95056e-f7c7-4bef-babd-61a8042c56f1.png)\r\n\r\n",
      "Thanks @alejandromf for looking, much appreciated.\r\nMy apologies for not testing, I will take another stab at it!",
      "After a second look I thought that the user with no role should be a RoleConfigurationException, and I see how you were just logging the issue and skipped adding them so I did the same.",
      "Thanks Earle, it's perfect. Just one thing. In the \"log.warn\"(line 1020) you have written for the Site \"group.getContainingSite()\" this shows something like \"org.sakaiproject.site.impl.BaseSite@452b863c\". I think it would be better to write \"group.getContainingSite().getId()\" to display the SiteId.",
      "I uploaded the changes applying yours before, but I didn't know that the \"push --force\" deletes your commits, sorry",

Earle showed me that using NumberUtils.toLong on the blank value would return 0 in this case, which we can then process much more naturally than the try/catch statement that createLong required, as it would throw an error trying to parse the same blank. This code interprets a rubric ID of 0 as an indication that the existing association for the tool and item should be removed [\"deactivated\"].\r\nI added a couple tests based on Earle's advice, and added another workflow to handle the case of an association that has been removed and needs to be reactivated.",

And also from the Questions ab Published Assessment -> Scores -> Questions `questionScores.jsp`\r\n\r\nItem cancellation works like so:\r\n1. Is called and sets pending cancellation on item (like `ITEM_TOTAL_SCORE_TO_CANCEL`)\r\n2. preparePublishedItemCancellation will set the score to 0 and depending on the cancellation method adjust scores of other items. The sore is set to a cancelled cancellation (like `ITEM_TOTAL_SCORE_CANCELLED`)\r\n3. Regrading will happen when the regrade and republish button is is clicked of for the Questions tab view, right away.

Exceptions are now ValidationExceptions\n(extending IllegalArgumentException). Stack traces do not include the Validate class, to make it simpler to see\nwhere the exception originated. Common validation errors including malformed URLs and empty selector results have\nmore explicit error messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the DataUtil would incorrectly read from InputStreams that emitted reads less than the requested size. This\nlead to incorrect results when parsing from chunked server responses, for e.g.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1807\">jhy/jsoup#1807</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build Improvement: added implementation version and related fields to the jar manifest.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1809\">jhy/jsoup#1809</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [2022-Jul-04]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the ability to track the position (line, column, index) in the original input source from where\na given node was parsed. Accessible via Node.sourceRange() and Element.endSourceRange().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1790\">jhy/jsoup#1790</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.firstElementChild(), Element.lastElementChild(), Node.firstChild(), Node.lastChild(),\nas convenient accessors to those child nodes and elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.expectFirst(cssQuery), which is just like Element.selectFirst(), but instead of returning\na null if there is no match, will throw an IllegalArgumentException. This is useful if you want to simply abort\nprocessing if an expected match is not found.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing HTML, doctypes are emitted on a newline if there is a preceding comment.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1664\">jhy/jsoup#1664</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, trim the leading and trailing spaces of textnodes in block tags when possible,\nso that they are indented correctly.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1798\">jhy/jsoup#1798</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#selectXpath(), disable namespace awareness. This makes it possible to always select elements\nby their simple local name, regardless of whether an xmlns attribute was set.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1801\">jhy/jsoup#1801</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

    "body": "This is **part two** of two rather large changes to enable more reasonable integration/acceptance testing. The first [reimplements the ComponentManager](#10676). The second layers directly upon this one, so both could be merged by way of this one. This PR enables and demonstrates acceptance tests for the Announcements tool with a real, booted kernel and no mocks.\r\n\r\nTo get there, and do some cleanup of the modi branch, this PR:\r\n\r\n- Adds test-helper, which is a \"fat jar\" of the whole kernel, edu-services, and dependencies; used as a test scope dependency\r\n- Moves away from the custom ApplicationContext class to a standard GenericApplicationContext\r\n- Adds convenient base classes for webapp and non-webapp integration/acceptance tests\r\n- Adds the requisite loaders/initializers to get the kernel loaded in test scope\r\n- Moves the implementation of the ToolPortal to portal-util so it can be used for real request handling tests\r\n- Adds a wrapper bean for SakaiProperties to begin normalizing the property loading process\r\n- Demonstrates some tests of the kernel and Announcements tool, using Spring mocks directly and through WebClient\r\n\r\nThe purpose of all of this work is to allow practical, real tests against the Velocity tools and enable refactoring, particularly in service of eliminating session state use. You can test through an entire real stack, including the RequestFilter and ToolPortal, with all of the User, Content, and Security services in place, in addition to the tool-specific service. Other approaches have attempted to mock all of the implied services -- an exercise that has too much overhead and false confidence. There are so many places where request, session, or thread-local attributes are used that this is the only way to have real confidence in refactoring.\r\n\r\nThere is a broader goal of realizing the promise of the kernel operating in a separate application context, with potentially reloadable components/modules in another layer, and then webapps below that, which this work nearly enables. However, there are some straggling issues that come from the safe-until-now assumption that everything is in a shared context. This test infrastructure uses context hierarchies, and lets you load your components within the kernel context or outside -- giving a migration path to better isolated components.\r\n\r\nThis PR would be safe to merge to main as-is. However, there are still a couple of general issues that show up when running multiple of these tests in an IDE. The Ignite and Ehcache configurations have some config/instance caching built in, which causes some trouble with how at least IntelliJ tries to keep things loaded across multiple test classes. There is some related conflict where the `@DirtiesContext` annotation was not creating a new context, but attempting to reuse a closed one. The test files run independently under Maven, so these issues do not come up in a normal `mvn test` run.",

The second layers [acceptance test support](#10677) directly upon this one, so both could be merged by way of that one. This one lays the foundation:\r\n\r\n- A new Launcher, which loads configuration, components, and overrides outside of the SpringCompMgr\r\n- An adapter to bridge the ComponentManager cover to the new, global application context\r\n- A Listener for Tomcat, to load components at startup and fail fast, before webapps start loading\r\n- Inversion of the dependency from the kernel/MessagingService to the components that register bullhorn handlers (a problem that emerged in the next phase, and could be handled outside this PR, if needed)\r\n\r\nThis moves us in the direction of an independently loadable kernel, modules, and apps, with standard Spring classes, conventions and injection, especially child contexts that can use annotations/JavaConfig. I've put everything in a \"modi\" package because I needed a name for the idea and a place for the code. Modi stands for Modern Dependency Injection.\r\n\r\nTo use it, simply add a Listener to your Tomcat configuration (conf/server.xml), probably after the last existing one:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <Listener className=\"org.sakaiproject.modi.TomcatListener\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the listener is not present, the classic ComponentManager will boot on the first use of the cover from the first webapp. If it is present, the Launcher will run and set the GlobalApplicationContext, so the cover will be ready to use with a fully initialized context when webapps load.\r\n\r\nThe commits here are relatively discrete and show the process of change. The implementation is effectively 100% tested (barring transient IOExceptions while reading already-checked directories).",

This really does have to do with the\r\nconcrete directory, so it doesn't hurt to mention it here, and it\r\nremoves some overhead with having the singular and plural classes.\r\n\r\n* Transform SakaiHome into Environment and build it out\r\n\r\n- Move path calculation and enforcement into the Environment\r\n- Handle catalina.base, sakai.home, sakai.components.root and\r\n  sakai.security in the initialization with comprehensive tests\r\n\r\n* Tidy up between the Launcher and Environment\r\n\r\n- Roll back to one exception type\r\n- Remove the Launcher constructor parameter in favor of the Environment\r\n  all of that part.\r\n- Clean up the straggling implementation in the Launcher\r\n\r\n* Move the remaining conventions from Launcher into Environment\r\n\r\nThis is a nice, contained refactoring. It moves the conventions about\r\nthe main config file and overrides folder into Environment. It also\r\nimproves the ergonomics considerably, by having the Environment expose\r\nall of these core settings as Paths.\r\n\r\n* Update Javadoc and test class/jar loading for components\r\n\r\nThis introduces a class and jar within the component fixture structure\r\nand tests that they are loaded properly. This brings the coverage\r\nto very nearly 100%, with only an unlikely in-flight I/O problem untested\r\nwhere a lib directory becomes unreadable after starting. That case is\r\nhandled with an initialization exception and detailed message.\r\n\r\nThe test class and jar are committed directly to avoid the complexity of\r\ncompiling and packaging during the test runs. We really only care that\r\nwe can load things, not build them.\r\n\r\n* Test the Listener and Launcher fully for start/stop\r\n\r\n* Bring testing up to effectively full coverage\r\n\r\nThere are two branches uncovered: catch blocks for IO errors reading\r\ndirectories after we checked that they were okay to read. Both are\r\nlogged with reasonable detail.\r\n\r\nThis also renamed TraditionalComponentTest to ComponentLoadingTest\r\nbecause it is not strictly a class test. I still consider it a unit\r\ntest, but it's a functional unit with a considerable harness.\r\n\r\n* Proofread and run everything through autoformatting\r\n\r\n* Allow MessagingService to do runtime registration\r\n\r\nThe requirement that handlers be set at initialization puts a dependency\r\noutward from the kernel to other components. This allows the service to\r\nstart up empty and then let the handlers register when they come up.\r\n\r\n* Switch bullhorn handlers over to explicit registration\r\n\r\n* Change modi system property to sakai.modi.enabled\r\n\r\n* SAK-43201 - Rename TomcatListener to SakaiStartListener"

The error messaging around this feature is not clear enough to inform the user how to use the autosubmit feature properly with either a due date, or a due date and a late acceptance date.\r\n\r\nIt is also not clear in the UI when using autosubmit which dates take effect, both in the information text around the features themselves, and in the resulting confirmation screen when publishing an assessment.\r\n\r\nThe linked PR address this in the following ways:\r\n\r\n* introduce new wording for the settings UI to explicitly state that students can submit until the later of the two dates\r\n* improve error handling and messaging to provide unique message for the two error cases:\r\n** Late submissions not allowed, auto submit enabled, no due date provided\r\n** Late submissions allowed, auto submit enabled, no late submission date and/or due date provided\r\n* introduce new information on the publish confirmation UI which highlights the autosubmit settings for the quiz:\r\n** Which date is effective\r\n** What the date is\r\n** How extensions interact with the dates/autosubmit\r\n\r\nWe've also addressed some issues on the student side:\r\n\r\n* introduce new honour pledge style confirmation when attempting to begin a resubmission to a quiz that is set to last or average score using autosubmit\r\n** submitting an incomplete quiz in this scenario could have adverse affects on grading for a student, so it's a good idea to make them aware of these consequences up front and make them consciously accept the risks\r\n* disable the \"continue\"/\"begin\" assessment buttons by default if there is either an honour pledge or an \"understand\" (resubmit consequences) pledge on the page, or both\r\n** they must accept the pledge(s) to begin or continue the assessment, so the buttons are only enabled after doing so\r\n* if either of the pledges are not accepted and the user somehow manages to click the button to begin or continue, they will be presented with an appropriately styled error message on the page, rather than in a JavaScript alert\r\n* added effective autosubmit date in the blue info banner on quiz start page, where all other quiz information is displayed",

    "body": "https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-47229\r\n\r\nAutosubmit occasionally fails to process submissions. One of the most common cases we encounter is that the quiz has been deleted (status = 2).\r\n\r\nIn practise we’re not really sure how this happens, because the UI will not allow a user to delete a quiz if it has even one submission (be it in progress, submitted, “invisible”, etc.). However, this remained the most common cause of autosubmit failures at our institution.\r\n\r\nRegardless of how this situation arises, it’s rather trivial to add some support to handle this scenario.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd piece of this ticket deals with \"empty\" submissions. An \"empty\" submission is one where the student began a quiz, but made no progress (no questions were saved). In the event of a quiz that accepts multiple submissions, consider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n    Student takes quiz, receives perfect or near perfect\r\n\r\n        This submission could have been manual, or via auto-submit (if via auto-submit, the quiz would have to have been closed and then reopened for further submissions prior to proceeding to the next step)\r\n\r\n    Student accidentally re-starts the quiz, realizes their error and aborts immediately after begging (either by logging out, or closing their browser after starting the quiz but making no progress)\r\n\r\n    This quiz now has 2 submissions for this user:\r\n\r\n        The originally submitted\r\n\r\n        The empty, non-submitted\r\n\r\n    Autosubmit runs again at quiz due/deadline, and the empty submission is forced through by the job\r\n\r\n    If this quiz is set to record either latest submission, or average submission, the student's grade will be adversely affected by the zero they receive for the \"empty\" submission\r\n\r\n        This scenario can lead to inquiries by both student and instructor as to the discrepancy in grading\r\n\r\nIn order to address this potentially harmful scenario, we should:\r\n\r\n    for re-submission that are empty, do not auto-submit them\r\n\r\n        use two dates, if it has only one date then it's \"empty\"\r\n\r\n            We determine \"empty\" if it has an attempt date but submitted date is null\r\n\r\n            Attempt date is populated as soon as student clicks \"Begin\"; submit date is populated as soon as student makes any progress (next, save, submit)\r\n\r\n            So if there is an attempt date but no submit date, we can safely assume this is a student who began a quiz and did nothing (either walked away, or logged out immediately)\r\n\r\n        set hasAutosubmitRun to true on these so they are removed from the queue for future job runs\r\n\r\n        set status to something other than \"In Progress\" so that instructors do not question what they see in the UI\r\n\r\n            we set it to status 5 (no submission), so that it doesn't confuse instructors in the UI\r\n\r\n* After re-opening a closed auto-submit quiz, the user who has an empty submission will be presented with the \"Continue Assessment\" button (rather than \"Begin Assessment\"), but in actuality they will not be continuing their \"empty\" submission from before: a new row is created for this subsequent attempt\r\n\r\n** This means we don't have to worry about flipping the status of the \"empty\" submissions after auto submit has run and then the instructor re-opens the quiz",

The “Apply this score” component is not rendered on the page, and students who have not submitted do not appear in the “Total Scores” table. This is because the “anonymous” IDs being used are actually the `assessmentGradingID` generated when a student submits, so it’s obvious why non-submitters don’t display in the table: they do not have a submission and thus they do not have a corresponding `assessmentGradingID`.\r\n\r\nThere is also an extremely easy way for instructors to circumvent the anonymity provided for anonymous quizzes: simply visit the “Submission Status” tab, which displays all students within the site, with their real names, and their submission time stamp. It then becomes trivial to match up the anonymous ID’s with the real names keying on the submission time stamp, which is displayed in both the “Submission Status” (non-anon) tab, and the “Total Scores” (anon) tab.\r\n\r\nThe linked PR addresses these issues in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- Don’t show the “Submission Status” tab for an anonymous quiz at all\r\n-- This way we don’t have to worry about anonymizing the data within\r\n-- There’s really no beneficial functionality in this UI anyway, for the context of anonymous quizzes\r\n- In “Total Scores” for an anonymous quiz, show all users:\r\n-- Those with submissions will use their `assessmentGradingID` as their anonymous ID, as they always have\r\n-- In addition, all users in the site who have not submitted should also be shown. They will not have a generated anonymous ID because they don’t have an associated `AssessmentGrading` record yet, so we will just give some static text for these “IDs”, and not make them rendered as links\r\n-- Allow the “Apply this score” component to be rendered for both regular and anonymous quizzes\r\n--- This way “Total Scores” UI consistently displays all users regardless of quiz type, and the wording of the “Apply this score” component does not have to change conditionally",

The whole job is in a single transaction, so any rollback will undo all the processing and effectively reset the queue to its initial state. This can cause the queue to just continue to grow over time. Additionally, each time the queue is reset due to rollback, the autosubmitted attempts that were processed will be processed again and the student will get another email about it.\r\n\r\n   2. Performance can be extremely poor. Job runs can take many hours to complete with large queues or “heavy” quizzes, potentially impacting users if the job runs past its expected window and into peak usage times.\r\n\r\nThe modifications to address these issues are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.  A new class, AutoSubmitFacadeQueries, is created so that Spring can create a separate transaction for each attempt in the queue. This means that any rollback will affect only the attempt that triggered it instead of the entire queue. The body of the queue loop is lifted out and placed into the new class with as little modification as possible to preserve the original logic. A small change was made to delay the email going out until the very end of the processing of the attempt after everything else has succeeded.\r\n\r\n   2. The queue loop is modified to retrieve information about each quiz only once, and only the required information for the job using getPublishedAssessmentQuick(). Previously the full quiz, including questions, was being retrieved each loop iteration even though all the attempts for the same quiz are grouped together.",

The root problem is that the Assignments service will return the String “null” for the assignment id when there is no assignment linked to the Gradebook item, causing it to log a warning when it shouldn’t.

While this causes numerous problems throughout Sakai, one in particular is that in Assignments, student will see a stack trace on the submission page if the assignment has attachments, or if they have previously submitted attachments to the assignment. This happens whether or not they have more submissions for the assignment available.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Sakai, a stack trace would only be shown if the student had previously submitted attachments (due to NullPointerException that is was what I was actually intending to fix here), and any attachments on the assignment itself would simply not be shown. I believe the current manifestation of the problem stems from recent work where a change was made so that empty properties were returned instead of null. Calling code may have been relying on the null check to determine if it was safe to access the properties, as was happening in the Velocity templates here. Some of the getters on ResourceProperties will throw exceptions if the property can’t be found, and this is what happens in Assignments and the uncaught exception is printed on the page instead.\r\n\r\nThis ticket address only the stack trace display issue, and instead will display nothing in the attachments section for the assignment and/or submission.

However, students do not see the late status on any of the UIs (assignment list, nor view submission). This information has meaning for both students and instructors, and should be communicated to both.\r\n\r\nPart of this is a regression: the late status used to be displayed to students in the assignment list table.

Also, if a student or instructor send a picture with Messages Tool, this information should be also private or not easy to know.

Instructors will have a copy of the new task, being able to edit it.\r\n- Students can only edit the description and due dates of their own tasks. This information can't be modified on system-created tasks or tasks delivered to students by instructors.\r\n- The _sakai-editor_ webcomponent can now be initializated with a content attribute.\r\n\r\n**Corrections**\r\n- Internationalization of alert message when hard-deleting task was added. It was hardcoded only in english.\r\n- _Sakai-pageable-element_ webcomponent should not reload data when setting _userId_ or _siteId_ properties. This was causing a double invocation that randomized the initialization of data when both properties where defined. This is changed to do data initialization on _connectedCallback_, that is invoked only once at component creation.\r\n- _Sakai-date-picker_ doesn't implement \"enable\" and \"disable\" at this time, so It was not working properly. This component is replaced to standard input _datetime-local_.",

Since the variable set (cprops) is private we can't set this on the class that already extends this.\r\n` String fontName = ServerConfigurationService.getString(\"pdf.default.font\");`\r\n\r\nThis code was added in [SAM-2276](https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-37252) to support latin characters. However I tested this both with and without this library and it didn't make a difference with latin character. Perhaps it's already supported fine upstream.\r\n\r\n* There was a change on [SAM-2660 ](https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-36424) about external images. But these also don't seem to be an issue as I can add images and the PDF is fine.\r\n\r\n[HTMLWorker](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/blob/master/openpdf/src/main/java/com/lowagie/text/html/simpleparser/HTMLWorker.java) has changed quite a bit since we forked it. I think ideally we'd want to pick up those changes. I created to branches, one that uses HTMLWorker and [one that keeps it with modifications.](https://github.com/jonespm/sakai/commit/66b88c60d5ffdf3c1f1105336e8ba8751d21ca87) I think this is the better one. \r\n\r\nOne thing I did notice is that [Chinese/Japanese characters are still](https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-21908) not supported. I don't see this as a regression. Maybe have to [look more into this later. ](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/wiki/Multi-byte-character-language-support-with-TTF-fonts)",

For the former, the X axis displays the Number of Students. For the former, the Y axis displays the Number of Students. Thus, callback functions for each axis use isNaN() to distinguish whether or not the axis variable is a number. If it is, then the axis is for Number of Students, and for such cases, I filter out all fractional values to display only whole number values in the graph.",

This might not be the best priactice in unit testing and can be improved by leveraging mocking frameworks.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Motivation\r\n\r\n- Decouple test class `MockTimeService` from production interface `TimeService`.\r\n- Remove redundant overridden methods that return `null`.\r\n- Make testing logic more explict and stub logic more explict.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Created mocking object to replace test subclass `MockTimeService`, decoupled test from production code.\r\n * Created method that return the mocking object for code reuse.\r\n\r\n<hr>",

      "SAK-46192 - Refactor Assignments / LTI External Tools For Sakai 21/22 (#9769)\n\nThe LTI support for Sakai 21 - worked, but there are a number of places where the Assignments shows information in the UI or is missing information in the UI that makes it hard to use. The basic problem was that all of the handling of scores in Sakai for LTI tools was handled by the Gradebook.  This made much of the Assignments workflow in Sakai pointless or badly broken for LTI Assignments.\r\n\r\nThe big picture of this change is that for LTI tools placed in Assignments, the grade flow is to/from the Assignments service no longer the grade book service but instead the assignment service and assignments sends grades to the gradebook using its internal logic.  With that change, there are current and emergent LTI grade flow features like activityStatus, gradingStatus, and the submission review launch that Sakai can now support with this change.\r\n\r\nThis is a dramatic improvement of the LTI integration into Assignments but the good news is that there are no data model changes and this should back port to Sakai 21 nicely."

During an investigation into client-side rendering performance I noted that this was taking a long time in Firefox. I found the following MDN article that recommends a different approach for performance reasons:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString#performance\r\n\r\nAnecdotally, after making this change locally I measured a reduction in JS rendering time for a large gradebook of approximately 1000ms, taking the entire time from 2200ms to 1100ms, so this is a noticeable improvement in this scenario. This was in Firefox. There was no real improvement in Chromium, so I assume it already makes this optimization under the hood. Still, for Firefox users with large gradebooks this will be a benefit.\r\n",

However, no such indication is given in the student view, which could be very confusing for students trying to understand how their category score was derived. Equal weight categories are also not indicated for instructors on the category column header itself, only in the item headers. This contrasts with extra credit, which is indicated in both places.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, students are also given no indication that a category is extra credit.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe styling colour changes are needed because by default both the extra credit and equal weight icons are gold. This gold colour is only needed in the grade cells for extra credit, and not needed at all for equal weight, so I refined the styles to only apply the gold colour in the appropriate situation.\r\n",

Despite how many times this has happened at Western, we've been unable to identify exact steps to reproduce. However, all cases have one thing in common: they're sending grades to an existing gradebook item.\r\n\r\nDue to not having solid steps to reproduce, we've historically been in a reactionary cycle, where when this happens it forces us to do a clone and restore to get the grades back into place. This process is extremely cumbersome and time consuming.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we decided to develop a feature to hide the ability for an Assignment to send grades to an existing gradebook item. In this way, we have dramatically reduced the frequency of this issue cropping up.\r\n\r\nNow, we realize that sending grades to an existing gradebook item is a legitimate use case, and some institutions may rely on this workflow. As such, we implemented this feature behind a new sakai.property (`assignment.allowLinkToExistingGBItem`) which defaults to `true` so that original functionality is retained OOTB.",

However, columns which you must scroll to see may exhibit incorrect sorting.\r\n\r\nThis happens because the sorting routine in Gradebook's custom JavaScript is not aware that Handsontable may remove column markup that is not currently visible due to scrolling.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nColumns were sorting using $handle.closest(\"th\").index(). The index() function is jquery that returns the element's position among its siblings. This works fine until you reach the point where Handsontable decides to remove the markup for the columns that aren't shown on screen. I'm not sure what threshold actually triggers this, but if you watch the markup as you scroll a large gradebook to the right, there will come a point where the leftmost columns disappear from the markup. Since they are no longer there, the index that jquery reports is no longer accurate for the overall table data.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an explicit column index into the markup for all column headers, and uses that to sort on. \r\n",

When the date picker opens below the date field, the date/time can be edited directly.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the buttons are injected into the markup after the height calculation of the datepicker is done. This is technically a bug with the timepicker addon that we are using, and was reported to the author in 2013 with no resolution:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon/issues/671\r\n\r\nI fixed it by removing the setTimeout wrapper as suggested in the github issue.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately as a side effect the datepickers in the Wicket SakaiDateTimeField component broke. Both JQuery UI and Bootstrap define a JQuery plugin called \"button\". As Sakai loads both on the page, depending on what code runs and when it runs, button() may be a JQuery UI function, or it may be a Bootstrap function. In this case, the JQuery UI datepicker was calling button() expecting its own version of the function, but instead it was getting the Bootstrap version and failing. The fix for this component is to call the Bootstrap method button().noConflict(), which relinquishes the button() function back to the previous owner, in this case JQuery UI.",

Therefore, in the case of highest submission, if you did worse or the same as your previously recorded score, the quiz will still be marked as modified if you resubmit after the modification.

For some reason, this UI makes use of conditionals on elements which use the boolean value of what amounts to be an unrelated sakai.property (the one from above that defaults to true and we set to false explicitly).\r\n\r\nSo this ended up passing QA because it was only tested in the default scenario: where this property was set to true. However, when this property is set to false you get the blank page with two buttons.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense to have these elements conditional on an unrelated property. The options displayed here are for the CKEditor, and have nothing to do with the ability of users to switch tab text from site title to site short description.\r\n",

It seems common for instructors to think that this is a setting that should be persisted when they save, and they are consistently frustrated and confused when they go back to the resource and their previous selection for the drop down is seemingly not saved.\r\n\r\nIn reality, this was never something that was supposed to be persisted with the resource itself.

This is similar to how in Confluence there is a checkbox allowing you to opt-out of notifying watchers about the modification you made.\r\n\r\nThere are some visual cues to indicate that the drop down is paired with the buttons and not the rest of the form (a horizontal rule), however that clearly gets missed quite easily.\r\n\r\nWe decided to attempt to make this distinction more obvious by:\r\n\r\n* moving the notification controls inline with buttons (drop down with options in Resources, checkbox in Drop Box)\r\n* change the label to read: \"Email notification for this update:\"\r\n* added aria-label and tool-tip on the drop down: \"Notify participants that this resource has been updated?\"\r\n\r\nThese changes should be applied to both Resources and Drop Box.\r\n\r\nBefore and after screenshots on the JIRA ticket.",

Thus, any score passed which is less than 1.0 will always trigger an `IllegalArgumentException`.\r\n\r\nThis was an erroneous implementation decision, as negative scores are perfectly legitimate in both Samigo and Gradebook. Funnily, the JavaDocs for the `LRS_Result` even state that you can pass `null` as the minimum to bypass that check:\r\n\r\n```\r\n         * @param min Minimum score (range) - any number (can be null)\r\n         * @param max Maximum score (range) - any number (can be null)\r\n```",

If you entered, for example \"10\" for the points value, you would only see \"10.\" with a cut-off 0 after the decimal point. The fields should be resized to display 2 digits on either side of the decimal, so 5 characters in total.

In one of the student's attempt, the `submitteddate` and the `finalscore` were both `NULL`. In an Oracle environment this forced the `NULL` score to the top of the query, so that in effect the student got a zero for the quiz instead of their original non-zero attempt.\r\n\r\nAccording to my research:\r\n\r\n> Oracle treats NULLs the same way as PostgreSQL. Specifically, Oracle's documentation states that \"if the null ordering is not specified, then the handling of the null values is NULLS LAST if the sort is ASC, NULLS FIRST if the sort is DESC.\" In effect, Oracle considers NULL values larger than any non-NULL values.\r\n> ...\r\n> ...\r\n> Like SQLite, MySQL considers NULL values lower than any non-NULL value. If you use this database, expect the same treatment of NULL values as illustrated above: NULLs will appear first if the values are sorted in ascending order and last if descending order is used.\r\n\r\nThis explains why the `NULL` floated to the top of the result set in Oracle, but was not reproducible in a MySQL environment.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this, we need to tell Oracle environments to use the same null precidence that MySQL uses, so that results are consistent between the two environments.\r\n\r\nAnother issue here was that the instructor was not able to delete the \"bogus\" attempt from the student because the submission lacked a `submitteddate`, which seems to be an invalid constraint on rendering the anchor to delete a submission through the UI.",

First there's a discrepancy between the permissions across the tool: on some places last visit and number of visits are tied to the same permission check (see RosterSiteEntityProvider), but on the page rendering side they aren't connected in that way. That means the value isn't filled but the field is shown.\r\n\r\nAnd the second problem I find is the visit count is never displayed, even with the right permissions.

    "body": "https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-44657\r\n\r\nWhen a user is deleted in LDAP/AD and not also cleaned up in the Sakai database, Sakai will constantly ask the LDAP provider(s) for the deleted user. It cannot be cached normally, because LDAP doesn't return the user details and thus a `User` object cannot be created for storage in the cache.\r\n\r\nThis can present performance problems on your LDAP server(s) (and consequently may slow down your Sakai nodes) if Sakai is querying constantly for either a lot of deleted users, or the same deleted users repeatedly. In one such instance, our Sakai instance was bombarding our LDAP server with over 75,000 requests per hour.\r\n\r\nOne solution to this is that when a user record is deleted in LDAP/AD, it must also be cleaned up in Sakai. However, this may not be an option for some institutions who have data retention policies in effect: they may not be legally allowed to clean up the user data in Sakai for various reasons.\r\n\r\nAnother more progressive solution is to implement a negative cache in Sakai for the `UserDirectoryProvider`. The way a negative cache works is that if the LDAP provider(s) does not return a result for a particular user, we cache this negative return. If the code recognizes that we've queried for the same user and received a negative result 3 or more times from the provider(s), don't ask the provider(s) for this user again until the TTL (time to live) for the cache expires. In effect, LDAP will only be asked 3 times per TTL per user for deleted accounts, rather than every time.\r\n\r\nThis code was developed by Sam/Longsight.\r\n\r\nSet the cache properties via sakai.properties:\r\n\r\n> memory.org.sakaiproject.unboundid.UnboundidDirectoryProvider.negativeCache=timeToLiveSeconds=86400,timeToIdleSeconds=0,maxElementsInMemory=100000\r\n\r\n**Note:** 20.x has both Unbound and JLDAP. I'll submit a 2nd PR shortly for 20.x JLDAP negative cache exclusively.",

When adding an extended time entry to a draft quiz (validate single entry)\r\n2. When adding an extended time entry to a published quiz (validate single entry)\r\n3. When saving a draft quiz (validate all entries)\r\n4. When saving a published quiz (validate all entries)\r\n\r\nDue to the design of the extended time interface, you must click the \"save\" button for the extension entry before clicking the \"save\" button of the quiz itself. If you save the quiz before the extension entry, the changes to the entry are thrown away.\r\n\r\nSo in effect the validation checks at locations 3 and 4 are duplicates and won't catch anything that wasn't already caught in locations 1 and 2. Further, the checks in 3 and 4 are actually causing the bug described in this ticket.\r\n\r\nI think it's safe to just remove the checks at locations 3 and 4, and that should resolve the issue here while retaining the necessary extended time validation on saving individual entries.",

As an extension, more instructors are delivering quizzes using the published assessment URL. Due to other issues, it can be quite easy for students to get click happy and/or become impatient and refresh the page before it finishes loading. The result is that the students are taken to the \"Data Discrepancy\" page.\r\n\r\nIn a normal situation, this Data Discrepancy page provides the user with a button to return to the samigo landing page (quiz listing UI). However, in the case of a quiz delivered by published URL, this button does not appear (nor should it in this case, the instructor intended for the user to take a specific quiz, not give them the option to take other quizzes in the site as well, plus the tool itself may be intentionally hidden by the instructor).\r\n\r\nSo in the case of a quiz delivered by URL, upon reaching the Data Discrepancy page there is no way for the user to return to the quiz (unless they're critical thinkers and paste in the published assessment URL again into their URL bar). This has lead to a lot of complaints and support calls at our institution, which is becoming burdensome.\r\n\r\nOne way to address this (for quizzes delivered by URL) is to present the user with a link to take them back to the \"Continue Assessment\" page, so they're easily and quickly able to resume their quiz attempt without intervention or support.\r\n\r\nAdditional mitigation (blocking them from getting click happy) is handled in another ticket: SAK-44248.",

    "body": "https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-44305\r\n\r\nIf a user begins to compose a message, specifies the recipient, and all other fields as necessary, and then saves the draft, upon returning to that draft later on, the user will find that the recipient is no longer listed.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFor the recipients, this is what is happening:\r\n\r\nWhen you save a message, the recipients are saved to a table and are assigned a recipient type: received, sent, deleted, draft, custom. For a normal message, the TO and BCC users get the \"received\" type, and the sender gets the \"sent\" type. When you save a draft, the TO and BCC users are ignored, and the sender gets a \"draft\" type.\r\n\r\nThis is important because of how message folders are populated. When you go into the Sent folder, for example, it queries for all messages that you are a recipient of with type \"sent\". Same goes for the other folders. If a saved draft were to retain the TO and BCC recipients, they would need to be assigned a type, so they would obviously get the \"received\" type. However, this will cause the message to appear in their Received folder.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the issue by creating a new recipient type \"draft received\" which is not used to populate any folders. When saving a draft, recipients are given this new type. When opening a draft, this type is searched for and used to pre-populate the TO and BCC fields. Additionally, when opening a draft, the draft's CC email setting is used to pre-populate that option now as well.\r\n\r\nKnown issue: When sending to groups, Messages expands the group members instead of saving a reference to the group. This results in the recipient list only containing individual users when opening a draft. For example, when you select \"All Participants\" for the TO field and save the draft, when you open the draft the TO field will be populated by the individual members of the site at the time of saving the draft.",

This data set is used on the nightly servers, where all community testing is performed.\r\n\r\nThe current demo data creates multiple offerings for multiple terms, and multiple sections within each offering. However, each section is currently limited to 30 students. While this provides a satisfactory test bed for most things, performance and scalability issues are difficult to identify when using small data sets.\r\n\r\nTo better assist with the discovery and reporting of performance and scalability issues, it would be beneficial to have a few of the provided demo sections contain much more than 30 students.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes adding 1 new section to each offering, which will contain 1000 students. Each of these large sections will be the last in the available list (currently number 7), and will be labelled \"Discussion 7 (mega-roster)...\" in the UI to be as clear as possible.\r\n\r\nWhile this does introduce some extra wait time when bringing up a server with `-Dsakai.demo=true` the first time, I think it's reasonable to expect some delays in this situation. I'm of the opinion that the benefits far outweigh having to wait a little more the first time you bring up your server (or the first time after the DB has been wiped).",

Although the UI looks much nicer than before, in terms of code implementation it's actually much worse compared to what we had before.\r\n\r\nIn the old system all you had to do was code your `EntityProvider` and add a tiny string in a message bundle in core Sakai code. Your `EntityProvider` was completely isolated in your tool (even a contrib tool!), and if you didn't deploy that tool to your Tomcat nothing bad would happen. The picker would continue to work with the `EntityProvider`s that were registered on startup.\r\n\r\nIn the new paradigm, you have your `EntityProvider` in your tool code, and then you also need to provide both a `FsItem` and `SiteVolumeFactory` for your entity in the `textarea` project. This introduces functionality duplication between your `EntityProvider` and your `SiteVolumeFactory`, and also between your `Entity` and your `FsItem`.\r\n\r\nNow, if you can ignore the voice in your head yelling at you for duplicating stuff in two places, it's not so bad... right? Well, maybe in the case of core tools. However, in the case of a contrib tool the problems get worse. You need to add dependencies to the contrib tool in core Sakai, and now if you don't actually deploy that contrib tool to your Tomcat, it's going to complain at startup, fail to create the `SakaiFsService` Spring bean and the result is that the `elfinder` plugin will fail to work at all. You can't link to anything, and you'll get an error message when you click \"Browse Server\".\r\n\r\nSo, what can we do about this? We can't just put the dependency inside a build profile, because you can't (as far as I'm aware) specify which classes to selectively include in the compilation, and dynamically alter the Spring bean definition in XML all through a Maven profile selection.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if you could override or add supplemental items to the bean definition from another project (say, the contrib project in question), but I'm not sure if this is even possible. If it is, then you could just move your `FsItem` and `SiteVolumeFactory` into your respective project (be it contrib or core), and everything would be isolated nicely again.\r\n\r\nI don't know of another option to handle this, other than forcing institutions who want this functionality to keep it as a local modification that needs to be applied and ported forwards indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAny input on this would be fantastic, and I thank you all in advance.",

If the external service does not provide some functionality you require, you need to also utilize the (internal) `GradebookService`.\r\n\r\nThe `GradebookService` operates primarily on the (internal) ID of the gradebook item in question, rather than the external ID. This is not so problematic if you either know the internal ID already, or if the \"name\" of the gradebook item corresponds directly with something you already know (for instance in the case of Assignments, the assignment name typically corresponds to the gradebook item name).\r\n\r\nHowever, there could be situations where you only have the external assessment ID, and you know that there's a possibility that the entity's name may not correspond exactly to it's gradebook item's name. In this type of situation, there's no good way to get the gradebook item (or related functionality) you need through the (internal) `GradebookService` by way of the external ID, apart from getting *all* the gradebook items for the site, iterating over them and doing some brittle comparison routine.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, it would be a lot easier and a lot more intuitive to just provide a method in the external service to retrieve the internal ID of the gradebook item, for subsequent use with the (internal) `GradebookService`.",

Unfortunately, we can't just restore this original functionality because that would be defeating the purpose of hardening the system to not expose undue information to a potential attacker.\r\n\r\nTo address this regression, we actually need to change the original implementation to be based off a sakai.property like invalidEmailInIdAccountString, which lists domains which are not allowed to use services like New Account, rather than a list of allowed user types (which forces us to resolve User objects in the back end to identify the user type, and reporting on this finding divulges information about if the account exists or not).\r\n\r\nIn this way, the domain can be checked before trying to resolve the User object, we can display some messaging about the domain being invalid or not allowed, and we don't leak any information about if the account exists or not (either via messaging, or by code analysis).\r\n\r\nThis is a significant change in behvaiour, and will necessitate removing old sakai.properties (\"resetPass.resetAllRoles\", \"accountValidator.accountTypes.accept\", and \"resetRoles\" which is the legacy version of the former), and introducing a new property to duplicate the \"invalidEmailInIdAccountString\" for Reset Password, so that institutions can define two separate lists of allowed domains, one for New Account and one for Reset Password.\r\n",

For Sakai 11+ this means that the SCORM tool IDs need to be added to the following sakai.property to ensure that the portal forces the tool into an iFrame, rather than inlining it:\r\n\r\n> portal.iframesuppress=:all:sakai.scorm.singlepackage.tool:sakai.scorm.tool\r\n\r\nIf the SCORM Player tool IDs are not included in the above sakai.property, the result is that the pop-up window generated when launching a module will be wrapped in the portal navigation markup. See the screenshots on the JIRA for an illustration.\r\n\r\nThe code that decides whether to inline or not lives in core Sakai code, in portal's `SiteHandler`. We need to identify and modify the relevant code here so that the SCORM Player's module pop-up windows are not wrapped in the portal navigation, but are also not embedded in an iFrame.\r\n\r\nThe main reason we want to accomplish this is so we stop having to fight with the iFrame boundaries. For instance, when the tool is embedded in an iFrame, anything inside the iFrame cannot access resources from outside the iFrame. So, things like JavaScript and CSS provided by portal can't be used within the iFrame. This paradigm forces us to then import the JavaScript and CSS resources we need within the iFrame, duplicating these resources which is an efficiency and performance hit.\r\n\r\nBy inlining the tool, we can do away with a lot of code within SCORM Player to add the necessary portal resources within the iFrame.",

Internally, Forums service methods will often cast directly to the appropriate subclass. For example, a Topic object is cast to DiscussionTopic.\n\nWhen these methods are called from SiteStats with the default database setting, Hibernate returns proxy objects instead of the real objects. The proxy objects are for the base class (ie. TopicImpl_$$_jvst4cf_3b), which then cannot be cast to the subclass (DiscussionTopic) and we get a ClassCastException. Interestingly, the same code does not return proxies when called from within Forums, or from SiteStats when it is configured to use an external database.\n\nTo get around this problem, this patch unproxies the objects similarly to SAK-24996. It also fixes some error handling bugs uncovered in SiteStats as a result of this issue.",

However, in the instructor context (where the instructor is viewing the grading UI for a particular student's submission), the `filter` would not find any submission matching the current user because the current user is the instructor, not a student. In this scenario, the code then falls back to the `orElseGet()` routine. This then has it's own `filter`, which in my testing never returns a submission. This results in the `orElse` stipulation returning a `null` `AssignmentSubmissionSubmitter` object.\r\n\r\nAfter the lambda is performed, there is a condition that must be passed before any further processing is performed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (scoringAgentEnabled && submitter != null) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere all the code which needs to be run in order to generate the scoring component icons/links is inside the conditional. If the `submitter` object is null (which is always the case in the instructor context), the conditional never passes and the icons/links are never rendered.\r\n\r\nThe bug was introduced some time after 12.0 (I haven't tracked down exactly what JIRA), but prior to the change the code was much different:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString studentId = submission.getSubmitters().toArray(new AssignmentSubmissionSubmitter[0])[0].getSubmitter();\r\n\r\n            if (scoringAgentEnabled) {\r\n                        // interesting stuff happens here\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that it really didn't care what/who's submission it was dealing with; it just grabbed the first submission object from the array.\r\n\r\nThe linked PR proposes the following changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    protected void setScoringAgentProperties(Context context, Assignment assignment, AssignmentSubmission submission, boolean gradeView) {\r\n        String associatedGbItem = assignment.getProperties().get(PROP_ASSIGNMENT_ASSOCIATE_GRADEBOOK_ASSIGNMENT);\r\n-        if (submission != null && StringUtils.isNotBlank(associatedGbItem) && assignment.getTypeOfGrade() == SCORE_GRADE_TYPE) {\r\n+       if (!assignment.getIsGroup() && submission != null && StringUtils.isNotBlank(associatedGbItem) && assignment.getTypeOfGrade() == SCORE_GRADE_TYPE) {\r\n            ScoringService scoringService = (ScoringService) ComponentManager.get(\"org.sakaiproject.scoringservice.api.ScoringService\");\r\n            ScoringAgent scoringAgent = scoringService.getDefaultScoringAgent();\r\n\r\n            Set<AssignmentSubmissionSubmitter> submitters = submission.getSubmitters();\r\n            String currentUser = sessionManager.getCurrentSessionUserId();\r\n            AssignmentSubmissionSubmitter submitter = submitters.stream()\r\n-                   .filter(s -> s.getSubmitter().equals(currentUser)).findAny()\r\n-                   .orElseGet(() -> submitters.stream()\r\n-                           .filter(AssignmentSubmissionSubmitter::getSubmittee).findAny()\r\n+                   .filter(s -> s.getSubmitter().equals(currentUser)).findAny() // If in student context, get student's specific submission\r\n+                   .orElseGet(() -> submitters.stream().findAny() // If in instructor context, just get the first available submission (group assignments don't show the icon anyway)\r\n                            .orElse(null));\r\n\r\n            if (scoringAgentEnabled && submitter != null) {\r\n                    // Determine if a scoring component (like a rubric) has been associated with this gradebook item\r\n                    ScoringComponent component = scoringService.getScoringComponent(\r\n                            scoringAgent.getAgentId(), gradebookUid, gbItemId);\r\n-                   boolean scoringComponentEnabled = component != null && !assignment.getIsGroup();\r\n+                   boolean scoringComponentEnabled = component != null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, we move the group check to the very beginning for a better short circuit mechanism, and we revert back to the old logic of just grabbing any submission from the list for the instructor context, while retaining the new logic to select only the current user's (student's) submission in the student contexts.",
