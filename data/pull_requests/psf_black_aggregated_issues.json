You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it."

The issue was that the empty last line does not count as a line to `adjusted_lines` because it is not in the list returned by `str.splitlines`. Since `adjusted_lines` is only called on the second pass of `_format_str_once` in `format_str`, the first pass would format the code correctly, then the \"invalid\" line would get removed from `lines`, and the second pass would format the whole code.\r\n\r\nI added a small change to `adjusted_lines` to cap the end value of any line tuple. For example, `--line-ranges 1-100` gets reduced to `(1, 4)` if the code is only four lines long.\r\nOne could change `if end > original_line_count` to `if end == original_line_count + 1` to only allow this one additional line, but I think allowing an oversized range to just cover the rest of the code is not surprising behavior, slices act similarly.\r\n\r\nI also added a call to `adjusted_lines` with the unmodified source code before the first pass of `_format_str_once`.

      "Thanks for tagging, @JelleZijlstra!\r\n\r\n> I also added a call to adjusted_lines with the unmodified source code before the first pass of _format_str_once. This is an additional computational expense but ensures consistency.\r\n\r\nWhy is this still necessary, after the change to adjusted_lines to cap the end value?\r\n\r\nCould you also add a test file next to https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/tests/data/cases/line_ranges_basic.py ?\r\n\r\nThis opens up a question on what happens when you specify a `--line-ranges=` that's outside of the unformatted file. This change makes it valid when you specify a larger `<END>`, but if the entire range is outside then the entire file is still formatted. How about make it format nothing if everything is outside of the range too? The implementation could be, instead of changing `adjusted_lines`, to call a new `sanitize_lines(lines, src_contents)` once in `format_str`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef format_str(...):\r\n    if lines:\r\n        lines = sanitize_lines(lines, src_contents)\r\n        if not lines:\r\n            return src_contents  # Nothing to format\r\n    dst_contents = _format_str_once(src_contents, mode=mode, lines=lines)\r\n    ...\r\n```",
      "Thank you so much for the feedback!\r\n\r\nCalling `adjusted_lines` beforehand is not really necessary. I just used it like one would `sanitize_lines` to make sure that any lines that would be removed on the second pass would already be removed on the first. Writing a new function for that definitely makes more sense!\r\n\r\nThank you also for noticing that moving the entire range out of the file still formats everything, I'll fix that as suggested.",

That was my solution to not duplicate any more code, but that could maybe introduce inconsistencies? I couldn't think of any, but it feels a bit off.\r\n\r\nI'm grateful for any feedback and suggestions!\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add an entry in `CHANGES.md` if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n",

      "Hi @KaiSforza .\r\n\r\nIt works for me in my project. `black` with your changes doesn't report anything where the official/released does.",
      "This would have to go in [the preview style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html#preview-style) since it changes existing formatting. Not sure the best way to go about it though, since it looks like it'd be a lot of duplicated code. It might be better to just remember to rerun the script before each January release",
      "@RedGuy12 I'll see what I can do. Thanks for the input.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, this is a bit of a weird bug, since in #3445 it seems like the `_width_table.py` file was actually generated with a different script than was committed. Originally the script had this if statement:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nif width == 1:\r\n    continue\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the final committed version had a different statement:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nif width <= 1:\r\n    continue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what is really causing the issue. If I hop into the squashed commit (ef6e079) and run the `make_width_table.py` script I get the same exact diff as this commit for the width table.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git status        \r\nHEAD detached at ef6e079\r\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\r\n$ python ./scripts/make_width_table.py\r\n$ git diff --stat\r\n src/black/_width_table.py | 364 +---------------------------------------------\r\n 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 357 deletions(-)\r\n$ git show --oneline --stat kai/uniwidth\r\n46e0a24 (kaictl/kai/uniwidth, kai/uniwidth) Added test for the Khmer language\r\n CHANGES.md                                         |   2 +\r\n src/black/_width_table.py                          | 364 +--------------------\r\n .../preview_long_strings__east_asian_width.py      |  31 ++\r\n 3 files changed, 40 insertions(+), 357 deletions(-)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo me, this kind of says \"it's a bug\" and points to not putting it in `Preview`. From what I can see based on the tests, this shouldn't change anything but a few language strings that are already causing issues in black right now.\r\n\r\n(check the commits in #3445 and note that the final commit doesn't change the `_width_table.py` file, but does change the `make_width_table.py`)",

      "An alternative approach is to detect the Python version in the virtualenv, and if it doesn't match what Vim was built with, then go through these steps:\r\n- inform the user that Vim won't use that virtualenv\r\n- reset `g:black_virtualenv` to its default value\r\n- create the default virtualenv as usual\r\n\r\nThis approach wouldn't enable mixing different Python versions and would use a bit of extra space for a new ~/.vim/black virtualenv, but should still leave the user with a working Black and no chance of confusion.",

I think this PR should be quite safe, but we could also\r\nconsider reverting some of the previous changes; the associated issues\r\nweren't too popular.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I think there's still behaviour that can be improved\r\nand I kind of want to make larger changes, but maybe I'll save that for\r\nif we do something like #3952\r\n\r\nHopefully fixes #4205, fixes #4209, actual fix for #4077"

This was caused by the existing black's logic to determine whether the `base` of the exponential expression is `simple` or not, meaning whether it does not have parenthesis or brackets and such and just accepting naming or dotted lookups. Essentially, the existing logic was to loop over the direction (base backwards, exponential forward) and find whether a bracket or parenthesis existed. This logic worked for the `exponential` case since it doesn't need to care about chained expressions. This PR is to involve checking whether base is a chained expression and check the expression is simple.  \r\n\r\nJust to make sure, I added some more complex cases that would cause the bug other than the case mentioned in the issue. \r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

However, at the only place where `cancel` is (indirectly) \"called\" (via `loop.add_signal_handler`), it is \"passed\" an object (`pending`) that can only be inferred by a type checker to be an iterable of `asyncio.Future`s (`asyncio.Task` is a subclass of `asyncio.Future`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/psf/black/blob/58f31a70efe6509ce8213afac998bc5d5bb7e34d/src/black/concurrency.py#L153-L164\r\n\r\nType checkers must infer `pending` to be an iterable of `Future`s rather than an iterable of `Tasks`, because typeshed annotates `asyncio.ensure_future` as returning an `asyncio.Future` rather than an `asyncio.Task` (and I think it's correct to do so). I think the call to `add_signal_handler` itself is valid here: the annotations for `cancel()` just need to be changed to say that it accepts an iterable of any `Future`: the items in the iterable don't necessarily have to be `Task`s.\r\n\r\nType checkers haven't been complaining about this up to now, because `cancel` is only ever indirectly \"called\" via `loop.add_signal_handler()`. Up till now, typeshed hasn't been able to annotate `add_signal_handler` properly, so mypy hasn't been able to infer that the third argument to `add_signal_handler` needs to be `*args` that would be valid to be passed to the second argument to `add_signal_handler`. If https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/11015 is merged, however, they'll start complaining about this (see https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/11015#issuecomment-1810345635)\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

It uses the diffing algorithm from `difflib.SequenceMatcher`. Unfortunately it could produce undesired results for certain edge cases like a list of unformatted lines with the same content.\r\n\r\nI _think_ we could use a custom algorithm that takes advantage of the diff is produced by a formatter (it rarely adds/removes lines of code, except blank lines, optional parenthesis). But it's complicated so I'm proposing to simply disable the stability check for now to avoid the crash mentioned in #4033.\r\n\r\nThis could still lead to formatting more lines than requested, but it should be very rare in practice. Even when that happens, it usually doesn't hurt too much if a few extra lines are reformatted. Also, if we could get rid of the two-pass formatting, this will no longer be an issue.

    "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nFixes #3850 .\r\n\r\n> This note has been edited for readability and ease of future reference.\r\n\r\nPreviously Black doesn't recognize `case` block as one of the syntax blocks need to be wrapped with invisible parentheses, and hence will also not be splitting the `case` blocks into multiple lines even when it's too long. \r\n\r\nNow with (invisible) parentheses correctly wrapped around `case` blocks, the lines are able to be splitted into multiple lines when needed, this also allows the trailing comma rules to be enabled for `case` blocks. Unit test `pattern_matching_long.py` and ``pattern_matching_trailing_comma.py`` has been added to verify these modifications.\r\n\r\nAt start, a side effect of this update is the altered formatting of `case case:` scenarios, resulting an additional space before the colon (i.e., `case case :`). This is due to Black after this update will treat the second `case` as a distinct block that requires invisible parenthesis. \r\n\r\nNow, a special patch to the `case case:` scenario have been made to preserve consistency of user-visible outputs.\r\n\r\n### A bit of discussion on the side effect prior to the special patch\r\n\r\n#### Some background\r\n\r\nPython 3.10 and later support matching the final case with an undefined pattern (e.g. `_`) as a default when other cases cannot match, this allow code like all following examples to execute and print the \"x\" without error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# E.g.1 the usual way for default case\r\nx = 1\r\nmatch x:\r\n    case 10:\r\n        print(1)\r\n    case _:\r\n        print(\"x\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# E.g.2 the unusual way 1\r\nx = 1\r\nmatch x:\r\n    case 10:\r\n        print(1)\r\n    case xxxxxx:\r\n        print(\"x\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# E.g.3 the unusual way 2\r\nx = 1\r\nmatch x:\r\n    case 10:\r\n        print(1)\r\n    case case: # note that here the second \"case\" is an undefined pattern instead of a Python keyword\r\n        print(\"x\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The side effect\r\n\r\nAfter enabling parentheses to be wrapped around `case` blocks (hence also line breaking), the output of this particular corner case in our unit test will be different:\r\n```\r\nmatch x:\r\n    case case:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously, `case` blocks were not considered for wrapping with parentheses, but now Black treats the second occurrence of \"case\" as an actual `case` block, so **an additional space** will be added between this occurrence and the colon. The underlying representation Black used for the second line is: \"case (case ()):\").\r\n\r\nHence, the output is now:\r\n```\r\nmatch x:\r\n    case case :\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while the consecutive `case` block now facing this additional space, the consecutive `match` block remains unchanged for unit tests like the one below, since the `match` block have no need of line breaking and was not using invisible parentheses.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmatch match:\r\n    case x:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nI was uncertain if it is preferable to add a special patch for this particular `case case:` scenario since this would adds additional complexity to the codebase. Even with Python 3.10+ allowing to treat the second \"case\" as an undefined pattern instead of a keyword, I would doubt developers will intentionally use a Python keyword as a pattern/variable. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, considering that the user-visible output should be left as unchanged as possible, a patch have been made to address this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add an entry in `CHANGES.md` if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add new / update outdated documentation? not necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Addresses #1100\r\n\r\nThe short form of the motivation is that form feeds represent a page break, and \r\nare used by some editors to organize code. Issue #1100 has a little more discussion.\r\n\r\nThis enforces a couple rules: a form feed is only allowed at the module level,\r\non a line by itself. Multiple form feeds in the same prefix are merged with each\r\nother. Any form feed is moved to the last empty line of the prefix it's in,\r\nwhich just seemed tidy to me.\r\n\r\nBlack already retained form feeds in two situations: internal to a comment,\r\nor in a string. I didn't change either of those, so that this MR won't actually change any code\r\nalready formatted with black. I went back and forth a couple times on whether to\r\nremove form feeds inside a comment: it'd probably be reasonable to do so?\r\n\r\nA form feed literal inside a string is probably better off as '\\f', but I figured that that's\r\nout of line for what black wants to do. Let me know if the snark in the documentation\r\nis too much.\r\n\r\nThe biggest change here if you don't care about form feeds is that I reworked comment\r\ngeneration so that generate_comments() will actually consume the prefix of leaves passed to it.\r\nDoing so simplifies normalize_prefix(), and I verified that there are no code paths to normalize_prefix()\r\nthat don't go through LineGenerator.visit_default() and generate_comments() first.\r\n\r\nI pulled in the _splitlines_no_ff() function from the standard library Lib/ast.py. Diffs that involve a \r\nform feed didn't work right when the splitlines() string function was used. For performance\r\nreasons, it has a compiled regex outside of it's function body, and I wasn't sure whether to keep\r\nthat regex near the function, move it to the top of the file, or maybe the constants file? Or if we're not\r\nthat fussed about performance of diff generation, I can just move the regex into the function body.\r\nI didn't create a test for that change; let me know if one is desired.\r\n\r\nI did have to make a small change to blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py, which I didn't relish, but\r\nit would eat form feeds after a dedent if I didn't. I didn't update the changelog in src/blib2to3/README\r\nfor that: should I?\r\n\r\nI put this behind a preview flag. It doesn't change any code already formatted with black, though.\r\n\r\nFinally, in EmptyLineTracker, I noticed that there's no situation in the test suite where current_line.leaves\r\nis empty. I'm not sure what it would mean if we did end up with a line that had no leaves there.\r\nBut every other time direct access to the leaves was needed had a check for whether current_line.leaves\r\nhad any contents, so I checked too.

      "Well, I can't say I'm too surprised that you feel that way. It's a niche feature, certainly. For languages besides Python, I think it's mostly C and Lisp. There's an open ticket for rustfmt to optionally not strip form feeds, but it hasn't attracted much attention either.\r\n\r\nI worked to keep the implementation as simple and unobtrusive as possible. Looking at it again now, I can simplify a little more, and further limit the number of places in the code where it's necessary to reference form feeds. I think it's an improvement, and I'll push it up. I also think that the complexity issue is not really your main concern, so I don't expect that to move the needle much.\r\n\r\nI think it's worth noting that VSCode displays the character, so most developers these days would be able to see a form feed if they encountered one. I think that's less confusing than it being invisible, at least.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think the change is pretty unobtrusive in regards to both the code and the style, and that out of the people who might be confused by it, only a small number are going to notice that anything's different. But I also understand if it doesn't fit into the Black vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that being said, if it ends up that you don't accept the MR, I think there's a couple bits worth saving:\r\n\r\n - The use of _splitlines_no_ff() in generating the diffs is a bugfix, regardless of the rest of the MR. The diff generated to remove a form feed is incorrect without that change, and not compatible with other diff-related tools.\r\n\r\n - I think some of the refactoring around the normalize_prefix() function is pretty good, and would still be an improvement without the form feed stuff. But that's a matter of taste, so I'm not sure how you or the other maintainers would feel about that part.",
      "Thanks for the explanation!\r\n\r\n@hauntsaninja any opinion on this one? I'm a little hesitant but the change is likely small enough that we can accept it.\r\n\r\n(@tungol could you fix the merge conflict?)",

      "Thanks, it does look like this changes the stable style. The case it changes is rather odd, but we should still follow our policy and make the change only in the stable style.\r\n\r\nSome options:\r\n\r\n- Just wait two months and merge this PR in January so it can go straight into the stable style, without waiting for preview. Seems OK since the change is rather obscure.\r\n- For now, keep formatting f-strings without any placeholders, and turn off formatting for f-strings with placeholders. This would fix the crash while preserving behavior. In the preview style we can also disable formatting for f-strings without placeholders.\r\n- Fix the crash instead by loosening the AST safety check (which already special cases docstrings). I'd rather not do that though.",
      "Option 2 would also change the stable style right?\r\n\r\nI would also like to avoid Option 3. Note afaict that the AST safety check special cases all strings, not just docstrings, which makes me even more loathe to take Option 3.\r\n\r\nSo Option 1 it is?",

      "Oh, it's not any f-string with placeholders. It's f-strings with leading or trailing space with placeholders adjacent to that space.

      "I'm not quite sure about this.

In those cases, I don't think either formatting is clearly better; it looks ugly either way. I'd rather have Black not make a change there, because every time we change the formatting of existing code, that's disruptive to users. I'd want to make changes only if we believe the new formatting is better. Therefore, I'd prefer to stick with the current formatting in those cases.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the rule could be that we split around the RHS if possible, and if that doesn't work, we preserve the current behavior and split around the second assignment target from the left.",

Somehow it feels more natural when as many assignments as possible end up formatted as early as possible. Consider for example this (rather extreme) example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nself.selectable = self.persist_selectable = self.local_table = self.foo_bar = self.foo = self.longlonglong_key = self.another_long_long_long_key = self.yet_again_a_long_key = value\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn current main it becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nself.selectable = (\r\n    self.persist_selectable\r\n) = (\r\n    self.local_table\r\n) = (\r\n    self.foo_bar\r\n) = (\r\n    self.foo\r\n) = (\r\n    self.longlonglong_key\r\n) = self.another_long_long_long_key = self.yet_again_a_long_key = value\r\n```\r\n\r\nand with this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nself.selectable = self.persist_selectable = self.local_table = self.foo_bar = (\r\n    self.foo\r\n) = self.longlonglong_key = self.another_long_long_long_key = (\r\n    self.yet_again_a_long_key\r\n) = value\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think a hybrid model would make sense here: \r\n\r\n```\r\nself.selectable = (\r\n    self.persist_selectable\r\n) = (\r\n    self.local_table\r\n) = (\r\n    self.foo_bar\r\n) = (\r\n    self.foo\r\n) =  self.longlonglong_key = self.another_long_long_long_key = self.yet_again_a_long_key = (\r\n    value\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think there is some inherent value to consistency and easy to follow rules. Thus I feel like we should stick with either splitting early or late, but not make it depend on the case, and in general it seems splitting late >= splitting early. And while I do appreciate avoiding introducing unnecessary diffs, this is quite the corner case and doesn't touch that many lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, as a contributor I trust your view on what is good and desired. Also, even though intuitively I feel consistency should weigh in cases where two formatting options are both ugly, I'm not fully sure if it should be enough to justify changing the formatting.",

      "> Apparently one line in Hypothesis would be changed due to this. Are bug fixes also supposed to go behind `--preview`?\r\n\r\nPart of the point of the stable style is so we don't have to decide whether something is a bug or a feature. When you upgrade from one version of Black 23.* to another, you shouldn't see any formatting changes on already-formatted code. However, in this case it looks like the change is made only in preview style, so you're fine!\r\n\r\nI'll look at the rest of the diff over the next few days.",
      "After looking at the format skipping code for a while now, it is starting to feel like modifying the AST by rewriting nodes to standalone comments might have not been the optimal approach and [PR #3610](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3610/files) might have been a step into problems in the future. Format skipping could instead be a property of the node and leave the tree intact. Then it would be the responsibility of `transform_line` to skip lines that contain nodes that have format skipping enabled.\r\n\r\nThere might be something I still don't understand about the code, but I think giving this change a shot could tell if it's feasible quite fast. Or if you @JelleZijlstra have some insight why the current approach should not be changed, please let me know! 🙏 ",

      "> I'm open to alternative approaches for implementing `# fmt: skip`. We'll just have to try it and see if it works.\r\n> \r\n> Is there a concrete problem that the current approach can't solve?\r\n\r\nI guess the current approach can solve cases, but it leads to the transformation code being contaminated with checks for standalone comment created by `fmt: skip`. Case example (from [issue 3438](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3438)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (\r\n    self.previous_line\r\n    and self.previous_line.is_import\r\n    and not current_line.is_import     <---\r\n    and not current_line.is_fmt_pass_converted(first_leaf_matches=is_import)    <---\r\n    and depth == self.previous_line.depth\r\n):\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be relevant to\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport foo\r\nimport bar  # fmt: skip\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the nodes are not transformed to standalone comments, we wouldn't have to check for it everywhere we might be interested in the fact. Currently there probably are edge cases where the code doesn't check both for node type and standalone comment containing that node type, but those are not tested against and nobody has reported them. And if they surface, I don't think fixing them with the current approach will be a battle that can be won.",

For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoooooooooooooooooooo([{c: n + 1 for c in range(256)} for n in range(100)] + [{}], {size})\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes currently:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoooooooooooooooooooo([\r\n    {c: n + 1 for c in range(256)} for n in range(100)] + [{}], {size\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is clearly very wrong.

The poll is currently 10 to 6 of favor of this style, which certainly isn't a slam-dunk, but enough for me to implement it and we can progress the discussion after seeing impacts on existing code.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty messy implementation, as can be seen by the sheer length and the complexity check having made me reformat my code several times to break out functions.\r\nI don't love the existence of `_split_first_typehint` and feel like that should be handled on a second pass by `delimiter_split` or something. And likewise I ideally wouldn't need any changes in `visit_tname` after #3899 - I don't really remember why I gave up on resolving it while keeping invisible lpars.\r\n\r\nI started out with `append_to_line` being a subfunction like in `delimiter_split` and `standalone_comment_split`, but when the complexity check for good reason wanted me to break up `_split_tname` I ended up having to add some helper functions to `Line` and `BracketTracker`, and while this is not *super* pretty it's probably better than having `append_to_line` repeated three times over in the code - and the other uses of it should probably be changed to use `_append_to_line` as well.\r\n\r\n~~I stumbled upon #3834 just as I thought myself done, and realized that case should clearly also be handled without parentheses. I'm not entirely sure why it isn't, but will probably add that to this PR.~~ derp, it can't use the `nextline` strategy as per normal type hints since they're not inside parentheses and not `tname`s.

But after reading more of the existing source code I started realizing that I was duplicating functionality, and in fact the only real thing that needed fixing was making sure that `right_hand_split` was applied to the function definition first when there's a trailing comma.\r\nI also found a bug in the string splitting of return type and attempted to fix that at the same time ... but I ended up concluding that it's probably better solved in a separate PR (if at all, who even writes their return types like that??) with a very different approach.\r\nI think there's a couple cases that can get improved, mainly cases like:\r\n```python\r\ndef aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa(\r\n    bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb,\r\n) -> list[Ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc, Dddddd]: ...\r\n```\r\nwould look much better if split on the right hand first. Detecting it also isn't terribly complicated (\"split on rhs if the return type is longer than the param list\"), I had it working in my original solution that rewrote left_hand_split.\r\n\r\nEnded up doing some code duplication due to `bracket_split_build_line` having the side effect of normalizing the indent, which led to `foo def() ->int: ...`.

      "Would be great if you could take a look! I have seen a bunch of different failures and I don't have any real idea of how to fix them for now:\r\n\r\n- The builds during the 23.9.0 release mostly failed with errors like `'importlib._bootstrap.FileData\\'>: attribute lookup FileData on importlib._bootstrap failed`. This suggests that mypyc sets the `__module__` attribute wrong on FileData (a NamedTuple in cache.py which was added in your PR), but I haven't been able to reproduce this in a smaller example.\r\n- I tried switching to a plain tuple instead of a NamedTuple (that's the current version of this PR), but some of the tests fail, possibly because the mocking doesn't work properly. (The tests pass without mypyc.)\r\n- If I compile locally on macOS, I get errors about a decorator in `linegen.py`, like `AttributeError: 'split_wrapper_dont_increase_indentation_obj' object has no attribute '__dict__'. Did you mean: '__dir__'?`. This suggests some bug with nested functions, but it's also hard to reproduce in a smaller example.\r\n\r\nUsing mypy 1.3.0 (which black was using until yesterday) or 1.5.1 doesn't seem to make a difference. ",

Did you mean: '__dir__'?`. This suggests some bug with nested functions, but it's also hard to reproduce in a smaller example.\r\n\r\nI managed to find a minimal repro for this one locally using Python 3.12.

It works fine for mypy, that's what I originally used as inspiration. https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/v1.5.1/mypy/fswatcher.py#L10-L13\r\n\r\nWill need to take another look at it tomorrow.",
      "This was interesting 😅 Quite a few surprising issues but I mostly got it working now, except for Python 3.12.\r\nFeel free to cherry-pick my commits from: https://github.com/psf/black/compare/main...cdce8p:ci-wheel-build\r\n\r\nAs for the specific issues:\r\n* `'importlib._bootstrap.FileData\\'>: attribute lookup FileData on importlib._bootstrap failed` this turned out to be a Python 3.8 only thing. It seems mypyc doesn't like it, when `pickle.dump` is used with a compiled `NamedTuple`. It's fine for 3.9 and up though.\r\n* `mocking doesn't work properly`: mypyc doesn't support patching compiled classes, so I had to add `@pytest.mark.incompatible_with_mypyc` for those tests.\r\n* For Python 3.12, I got a few new errors. Some of them I managed to fix already:\r\n  * `ImportError: cannot import name 'Mode' from 'black'` and there like. Those seem to occur if a name is imported from a module that doesn't explicitly reexports it. E.g. `Mode` is defined in `black.mode` originally. Not sure those why it works for 3.11.\r\n  * One new `DeprecationWarning` from aiohttp. It's already fixed upstream but not released yet. Added an ignore for that.\r\n\r\nOpen issues (Python 3.12):\r\n* `AttributeError: 'split_wrapper_dont_increase_indentation_obj' object has no attribute '__dict__'. Did you mean: '__dir__'?` which @AlexWaygood already managed to debug.\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/issues/16077\r\n* `RuntimeError: Please install Black with the 'd' extra`: That's a bit surprising as the `d` extra is already installed. Not quite sure what's up with that.\r\n\r\nAlthough nice, I don't think it's necessary to ship wheels for Python 3.12 just yet. The sdist already works. `23.9.0` would have been to first time those would have been built anyway. Maybe let's skip those for now.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Full cibuildwheel Python 3.12 testing log</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nTesting wheel...\r\n  \r\n      + pip install virtualenv -c

      "Thanks, that's really helpful! Good catch on the NamedTuple thing being an issue only in 3.8.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it's worth always pickling the raw tuples, as it makes the file size a lot smaller:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [78]: len(pickle.dumps(FileData(1, \"x\", 1.0)))\r\nOut[78]: 92\r\n\r\nIn [79]: len(pickle.dumps((1, \"x\", 1.0)))\r\nOut[79]: 29\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough it gets amortized a bit if there are many objects:\r\n```\r\nIn [80]: len(pickle.dumps([FileData(i, \"x\", 1.0) for i in range(100)]))\r\nOut[80]: 2571\r\n\r\nIn [81]: len(pickle.dumps([(i, \"x\", 1.0) for i in range(100)]))\r\nOut[81]: 1518\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought this might be costly because we'd have to convert to `FileData` at unpickling time and that would be slower, but it's actually faster!\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [82]: p1 = pickle.dumps([FileData(i, \"x\", 1.0) for i in range(100)])\r\n\r\nIn [83]: p2 = pickle.dumps([(i, \"x\", 1.0) for i in range(100)])\r\n\r\nIn [84]: %timeit pickle.loads(p1)\r\n66.5 µs ± 101 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [85]: %timeit [FileData(*t) for t in pickle.loads(p2)]\r\n37.3 µs ± 95.6 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPresumably pickle is faster at unpickling tuples than NamedTuples.\r\n\r\nFor the `Mode` thing, I think I'd prefer to explicitly export it from `__init__.py`, since some users are using it: https://grep.app/search?q=black.Mode&case=true. We don't yet define a public API, but if we did `Mode` would probably be in it. I'll do that in a separate PR.",
      "There is no specific need to use `FileData` with `pickle`, so I would be fine with using a raw tuple there. Just though it might not be worth the additional complexity.\r\n\r\nAlthough, a normal tuple will certainly make it easier to manually unpickle these files if one should ever want to inspect it.",

      "No, the call stack isn't automatically compatible with the stack we need here.\r\n\r\nYou need to change how `endprog` in `generate_tokens` works for strings. This is where the new stack needs to be.\r\n\r\nWhen you encounter `f\"` then you switch to string literal tokenizing, looking for either `\"` or `{` as `endprog`. When you encounter `{` you *add* `}` to the `endprog` stack and switch back to regular tokenizing... but since the stack is not empty, you watch out for a `}` to return back to string tokenizing.\r\n\r\nThat way you can encounter another `\"`, switch to string tokenizing, and add a `\"` as `endprog` to switch back to regular parsing. And when you reach *that* `\"`, then you remove it from the stack, switch to regular parsing, but there's still `}` on the stack so you keep looking for that.\r\n\r\nAt no point are you iterating a counter like `curly_brace_level`.

But I agree, it's easy to accidentally forget the read.\r\n\r\n> I think I'd prefer one of:\r\n> a) make `file_data` a property that reads the cache file if `self._file_data` is not set\r\n> b) initialise `file_data` to None, so we get errors if we try to use the Cache without `read`-ing first\r\n> c) revert to before the last commit\r\n\r\nI don't like (a). Doing the `read` when accessing the `file_data` is not something one would expect. It should either be in the constructor or a separate method. That's one thing I liked about the initial implementation `Cache.read(mode)` as classmethod was quite explicit and you immediately knew what would happen.\r\n\r\nI reverted the commit.

    "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nFix #3737 \r\n\r\n### Analysis of this issue:\r\nBlack has no problem parsing multiline *consecutive* magical comments like `type: ignore`, it works fine with these examples:\r\n```python\r\nprint(   \"111\") # type:ignore\r\nprint(   \"111\"                         ) # type:ignore\r\nprint(   \"111\"       ) # type:ignore\r\n```\r\nBut Black encountered issue when parsing multiline **open-parenthesis** *consecutive* magical comments, code like this will cause Black to produce an `INTERNAL ERROR: Black produced code that is not equivalent to the source.` problem:\r\n```python\r\na = (  # type: ignore\r\n    int(  # type: ignore\r\n        int(  # type: ignore\r\n            int(  # type: ignore\r\n                6\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves the issue by adding an additional check, before it try to remove outer parentheses. \r\n\r\nAdditional regression test has been added in `tests/test_black.py`, and the input & desired output has been placed under `tests/data/miscellaneous` folder.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, Black will produce the following output for the example code above:\r\n```python\r\na = (  # type: ignore\r\n    int(  # type: ignore\r\n        int(  # type: ignore\r\n            int(6)  # type: ignore\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the innermost layer remains formatted, despite the presence of a `type: ignore` for that line, the reason is because I find when it comes to the innermost layer, it seem to be a different kind of node (the type of Node would be `322` instead of `267` for outer layers). \r\n\r\nSo in order to change this behaviour, some nuanced modifications on a larger scale seems to be necessary while making sure not breaking any current things, meanwhile, it also makes sense to 'always format the innermost layer' based on examples here and in the original issue ticket. So I'm not entirely clear whether it's a good idea to do so. But for now, it correctly understands this kind of magic comment usage and no longer raises the internal error.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add an entry in `CHANGES.md` if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n\r\nSince it's a bug fixing and not making much enhancement, so I don't think anything is need to be added to documentation.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any changes are needed!",

Here are a few considerations. Most are tradeoffs between accuracy and increased maintenance:\r\n\r\n- Should an exhaustive list of authors be added (and maintained), or Łukasz Langa only, or add \"the Black development team\" as another author, or just have the dev team listed as the author? The latter option seems the most common.\r\n- Should the version number be added (and maintained)?\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

      "Thanks for the PR!\r\n\r\nWe can steal what's in the footer of the documentation: \r\n\r\n> Łukasz Langa and contributors to Black\r\n\r\nAnd I'd discourage maintaining a copy of the version number in the citation file. I recognize it may be helpful for citers, but it would introduce more friction during releases (which I'd like to avoid).\r\n\r\nA changelog entry isn't necessary here, but it would be nice either way. Putting it under `Documentation` would be the way to go.",
      "I think I'd actually prefer a changelog entry, as presumably we want users to know about this. We should omit a changelog entry only if users don't need to know about the change.",
      "I have updated the authorship information and the changelog. Hopefully the authorship information looks okay. If not, I can change it to a single author with the literal string \"Łukasz Langa and contributors to Black\" instead of divided into 2 author fields.\r\n\r\nRegarding version number, I agree, it is much more friction. Also, while version number is important, most citation styles don't include version numbers anyway. So if a user wants to be explicit, they can include that information manually, usually directly in the text.",

      "According to [PEP 597 (motivation)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/#using-the-default-encoding-is-a-common-mistake), UTF-8 is the default encoding on non-Windows systems, so by specifying it, you provide clarity and consistent behavior across platforms. You could specify `encoding=\"locale\"`, but I'd only recommend that if compatibility is essential and the variance is desirable. In my experience, it's almost always the case that using UTF-8 as the specified encoding provides the best experience and rarely leads to surprise. You should ask yourselves, do you expect that users have specifically put non-ascii non-UTF-8 characters in the grammar files and expect those to work only in that locale. If not, you probably want UTF-8. If so, you may want to migrate users away from that assumption.",
      "Users shouldn't put anything in the grammar files, we control all the grammar files and we don't support users providing their own. My hesitation is only about verifying that this codepath is purely about opening the internal grammar files, not user code.",

It looks like you have some special handling for `# type: ignore` comments to avoid moving said comments around due to positional meaning.

      "Should we add this to `black.comments.contains_pragma_comment` instead? I think these pyright comments are more like `noqa` than like `# type:`, which is treated specially by the Python parser.",
      "Ah, my understanding is that the pragma stuff only applies to string concatenation and splitting. I'm really hoping to fix the annoyance of having\r\n\r\n```py\r\nblah_blah_blah = [ # pyright: ignore\r\n    ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nshift into\r\n\r\n```py\r\nblah_blah_blah = [\r\n    ...\r\n] # pyright: ignore\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe behavior in https://github.com/psf/black/blob/de65741b8d49d78fa2675ef79b799cd35e92e7c1/src/black/lines.py#L263 is what I'd love to have, ideally.",
      "Hi! I wanted to see if there any concerns about gettin this merged other than fixing the conflicts?\r\n\r\nIf it isn't clear, we get scenarios where black transform code from this\r\n```py\r\nsome_long_variable_name = some_long_dict_name[0] # pyright: ignore[reportGeneralTypeIssues]\r\n```\r\nto this\r\n```py\r\nsome_long_variable_name = some_long_dict_name[\r\n\t0\r\n] # pyright: ignore[reportGeneralTypeIssues]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere after the transformation, the ignore is no longer being applied to the actual line causing pyright to error. This looks similar to the `# type: ignore` fix and this would helpful to have! Let me know if you have any other questions!\r\n\r\nOur current solution is use cast or do a rename that looks like this\r\n```py\r\na = some_long_dict_name[0] # pyright: ignore[reportGeneralTypeIssues]\r\nsome_long_variable_name = a  # pyright: ignore[reportGeneralTypeIssues]\r\n```\r\n which are both not ideal scenarios and is very tedious and adds unnecessary bloat to the codebase.\r\n\r\nAlso using `# fmt: skip` doesn't work because sometimes it is ignored and moves the comment anyways.",
      "@JelleZijlstra \r\nIn this case, is it better to do change it in the `contains_pragma_comment` to get the intended behavior or does it make sense to keep it in `is_type_comment`?",
      "I need to look more into this to figure out exactly how we use these, but a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I think we should treat the pyright comments more like the pylint comments than like the `# type: ignore` comments. `# type:` comments are extra special because they are treated specially by the Python AST, so it makes sense to be even more conservative with them. \r\n- I'd prefer to find a solution that avoids Black having too much knowledge of magic comments used by specific tools, since that's bad for long-term maintainability.",
      "Would it make more sense to add a Black configuration option opting certain types of patterned comments into the unsplittable behavior, then?",
      "Would love to see this feature, it's much needed.",
      "> type: comments are extra special because they are treated specially by the Python AST, so it makes sense to be even more conservative with them\r\n\r\nFor my education, can you please elaborate how they are treated differently?",
      "Looks like the best path forward for our company at the moment is to fork black and apply this patch. We really need this functionality soon. This is very unfortunate, I hope there is a path forward in upstream to resolve this.",
      "Actually just tried applying the patch on `23.3.0` with python 3.9 and it doesn't seem to change anything... Maybe that's what you referred to @JelleZijlstra ?"

One problem of it was that, for a requires-python value of \">3.X\" (which means the same as \">3.X.0\"), it concluded that target version 3.X is not supported although Python versions >= 3.X.1 are included in the version specifier. I found the old approach hard to reason about and hard to fix.\r\n\r\nTo correctly check whether a target version 3.X is supported, the algorithm must check if 3.X.* overlaps the version specifier in the requires-python project metadata. Checking only specific versions (like 3.X.0) is not sufficient in general. The `packaging` library, which implements the logic for (PEP440-compatible) versions and version specifiers, doesn’t implement checking for overlap of two version specifiers, however.\r\n\r\nThe new algorithm works by converting the version specifiers to interval sets, which are then checked for overlap.\r\n\r\n<!-- Good things to put here include: reasoning for the change (please link\r\n     any relevant issues!), any noteworthy (or hacky) choices to be aware of,\r\n     or what the problem resolved here looked like ... we won't mind a ranty\r\n     story :) -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

      "> Hm, this seems a little complicated. I wonder if this is something that could be upstreamed to packaging.\r\n\r\nI tried several approaches to solve the problem fully, and all other approaches were both incomplete and more complicated. Mapping the specifiers to interval sets first made it much easier to reason about, even though the total amount of lines is longer. First I used some library for the interval set, but replaced it to simplify packaging (not the library that you are referring to ☺).\r\n\r\nI don’t know if the `packaging` library would accept something like this. Checking for overlap of two version specifiers or emptyness of a version specifier is probably too niche. But I guess that if it can replace the current implementation for checking whether one version is contained in the specifier by something simpler, there would be a good chance.\r\n\r\n> Note that if black maintainers want something closer to the old approach, here's a diff that is 98% of the way there and passes almost all of the excellent tests in this PR (it fails `==3.3.0,==3.3.1`, which is invalid / quite contrived and also maybe the \"fail\" behaviour is desirable. I also had to disable the versions that packaging emits DeprecationWarnings on):\r\n\r\nAfter I implemented the approach in this PR, I also implemented a similar approach as in your diff, except that it checked for 3.X.0 or 3.X.99 (that shouldn’t matter, though) and got rid of `strip_specifier_set` completely. But at this time, I had already implemented the “full” solution, so I submitted only that.\r\n\r\nI think that either approaches would be fine. But if it doesn’t recognize all Python patch versions, it should be transparent in the documentation. By the way, the reason why I found this bug was that the phrase “Black will to infer this from the project metadata” didn’t assure me, so I looked in the code.",
      "> Hm, this seems a little complicated.\r\n\r\nI had the same initial thought when looking at this PR. A fix for the concrete issue (`>3.7` doesn't include `py37`) could be much simpler as you've noted.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's up to the `black` maintainers how they decide to weigh in the complexity here."

      "I added the changelog entry. I'm marking this as ready for review though I'd like to point out that I have not updated integration documentation yet because I'm not sure what parts of it you would want me to update if any. Arguably, the `version` input is still preferable since it allows matching stability policy with a specifier such as `~= 22.0` The main benefit of this change is avoiding confusion when someone specifies *only* the action version. But perhaps you would want me to change that whole document such that it recommends using the action version for pinning and `version` input for version ranges. Such a case could require significant document restructuring, so I'm holding off on that for now."

But as far as I can tell, this didn't have user visible impact (until this PR).\r\n\r\nI added a dedicated test data folder `preview_context_managers`, because this relies on the version detection logic when `--target-version` is not explicitly specified.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

    "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a few documentation changes for the Vim plugin. I included them in the same PR to avoid clutter and because they're all pretty minor and easily reviewed together. I also made a commit for each thematic change, so feel free to look at specific commits if you want to see the changes in isolation. I didn't think this was a substantial enough change to warrant a `CHANGES.md` entry, but am happy to add one if maintainers disagree.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 main changes in here:\r\n\r\n#### Formatting and Organization\r\n\r\nCommit: https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3468/commits/26c56f2a902dc59690a6526d9fd7e5d369f57b5b and https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3468/commits/197edbd58a55b8e9446a61bd8e1ff2d8b26b32bd\r\n\r\nCurrently there are no sub-headers under the Official Plugin section, which can make it a bit tough to read and especially to hyperlink to. Organized it into Installation, Usage, and Troubleshooting as felt appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Add missing configuration options\r\n\r\nCommit: https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3468/commits/9929893e57154e4b4d4707feeba7376039286056\r\n\r\nA few configuration options exist but weren't mentioned with their defaults at the top of the Vim plugin documentation section, so I added those.\r\n\r\n#### Add plugin documentation for Arch Linux\r\n\r\nCommit: https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3468/commits/bb0f44602edb0215159cb232ea4fede4f84d14ce\r\n\r\nRefer to this issue on the Arch Linux `python-black` package: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/73024\r\n\r\nSince earlier this calendar year, the Black package distributed on Arch Linux ([`python-black`](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/python-black/)) also ships the Vim plugin, so I added a section to the Installation section mentioning that Arch Linux users need no further steps to use the plugin than installing Black.\r\n\r\n#### Fix the vim-plug installation recommendation\r\n\r\nCommit: https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3468/commits/1a73b724677ebf54894a238172b6074d950ea8cc\r\n\r\nRefer to this discussion on the `vim-plug` repo: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/pull/720#issuecomment-1105829356\r\n\r\nUsing the `stable` tag as a `branch` in `vim-plug` is a bit of an antipattern that doesn't work correctly, as it doesn't always re-resolve the SHA when the `stable` tag is moved. According to the maintainer, using the `tag` key with a shell wildcard is the better way to go. I selected `'*.*.*'` as the wildcard since it matches [Black's documented versioning scheme](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/release_process.html\\#cutting-a-release) and will not match on the current standard for Alpha versions (which only have one dot). You can see how this works in the image below; it matches on `22.12.0` (the latest stable release) even though the latest version overall at time of writing is `23.1a1`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4631191/208765802-0671e82c-c230-4e1d-85d1-6efe0c0eca5b.png)\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [X] Add an entry in `CHANGES.md` if necessary? (Seems a small enough change to not need an entry, do maintainers agree?)\r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary? (just docs, not necessary)\r\n- [X] Add new / update outdated documentation?",

      "Vim plugin docs improvements (#3468)\n\n* Organize vim plugin section with headers to separate out Installation, Usage, and Troubleshooting for readability and easy linking\r\n\r\n* Add missing plugin configuration options, with current defaults\r\n\r\n* Add installation note for Arch Linux, now that the plugin is shipped with the python-black package (ref: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/73024)\r\n\r\n* Fix vim-plug specification to follow stable releases. Moving the same tag is an antipattern that doesn't re-resolve with vim-plug, see this discussion for more detail (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/pull/720\\#issuecomment-1105829356).

Each transform will create a new `line` with 1) one group of strings merged; 2) one group of strings' parens stripped. This new `line` is then re-checked by those transformers. This is `O(n^2)` complexity.\r\n\r\nSince these transformers won't cause line breaks, the same transforms can be done at one pass, and it only creates one new `line`. The new approach is `O(n)`.\r\n\r\nTested on the example from #3340 (not compiled, since I'm failing to use cibuildwheel to compile with mypyc on my machines):\r\n\r\n1. Before this change, it took ~111 seconds to finish after I increased the recursionlimit to 1M\r\n2. After this change, it took ~3.7s\r\n3. In the stable style without ESP, this file takes ~2.5s.

This PR creates a new tag to be pushed to Docker Hub going forward (`latest_prerelease` which will be updated with every alpha version release.\r\n\r\n**I do have another change to request along with this...**\r\n\r\nIf someone comes across the official Black image on Docker Hub, the description is a shortened version of the README with a link to the full docs. There isn't an obvious pointer to the documentation of which Docker image tags are in use and for what purpose. I don't think duplicating the information there is necessarily the right way to go (unless it's sourced in this repository), but having another explicit link to that specific docs page would grease the wheels just a bit for folks discovering it on Docker Hub.\r\n\r\nI don't see where in the source code that Description on DockerHub is maintained, and so I think it's probably been manually set by a maintainer. Linking to Black's Full Documentation still makes sense to me, but I think an additional line just above that would be helpful, something like the following:\r\n\r\n> Official Docker Image Documentation: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_and_configuration/black_docker_image.html\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [X] Add an entry in `CHANGES.md` if necessary?\r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary?

Unfortunately pyright doesn't support stringified annotations that span multiple lines, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef something(\r\n    arg,\r\n) -> (\r\n    \"VeryLongClassNameWithAwkwardGenericSubtype[int] |\"\r\n    \"VeryLongClassNameWithAwkwardGenericSubtype[str]\"\r\n):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though other type checkers (mypy, pytype, pyre) do support them. To be safe, we can choose to exclude them from ESP for now. Note we _could_ technically choose to try merging them into a single string when the result fits in the line-length, but this would be more complicated than simply excluding them from ESP.\r\n\r\n2. The crash is because of unmatched brackets. In ESP, it can process lines continued from earlier line breaks, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef something(\r\n    arg,\r\n) -> \"VeryLongClassNameWithAwkwardGenericSubtype[int] | VeryLongClassNameWithAwkwardGenericSubtype[str]\":\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe line can be `) -> \"VeryLongClassNameWithAwkwardGenericSubtype[int] |VeryLongClassNameWithAwkwardGenericSubtype[str]\":` while processing.

If you are not familiar to CJK languages it is not clear immediately.  Let me elaborate with some examples.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, East Asian characters (including punctuations) have taken up space twice than European letters and stops when they are rendered in monospace typeset.  Compare the following characters:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcdefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe characters at the first line are half-width, and the second line are full-width.  (Also note that the last character with a small circle, the East Asian period, is also full-width.)  Therefore, if we want to prevent those full-width characters to exceed the maximum columns per line, we need to count their *width* rather than the number of characters.  Again, the following characters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are just 4 characters, but their total width is 8.\r\n\r\nSuppose we want to maintain up to 4 columns per line with the following text:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcdefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow should it be then?  We want it to look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcd\r\nefg.\r\n글、\r\n字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, Black currently turns it into like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcd\r\nefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's because Black currently counts the number of characters in the line instead of measuring their width.  So, how could we measure the width?  How can we tell if a character is full- or half-width?  What if half-width characters and full-width ones are mixed in a line?  That's why Unicode defined an attribute named `East_Asian_Width`.  Unicode grouped every single character according to their width in fixed-width typeset.\r\n\r\nSo, this patch tried to change how Black measure line widths using `East_Asian_Width` attribute, and I believe it works well with full-width characters now.  However, I am not confident if I implemented things in a proper way, so please let me know if I need to adjust!\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe it partially addresses #1197, but I touched only string splitters.

      "How nice!\r\n\r\nBut I have a question. How about handling for non string literal such as variable name, function name, class name, comment?\r\n\r\nExamples are below\r\n```py\r\n# comment\r\n\r\n# 이 값을 건드리면 당신은 야근을 면치 못 할 것입니다. 이상하게 보여도 절대 수정하지 마세요 모두를 위해 그냥 둡시다. - 전임자 드림\r\nANSWER = 42\r\n```\r\n```py\r\n# function name\r\n\r\ndef 영어주소2한글주소(country: str, province: str, city: str, street_address1: str, street_address2: str, extra_data: dict[str, any]) -> str:\r\n    pass\r\n```",
      "@item4 Other than string literals are not covered by this patch.  I would appreciate if someone works on it further.",
      "Here's also few more points we need to address in the future:\r\n\r\n- There are zero-width characters like U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE.  They are designated `N` (narrow) according to `East_Asian_Width`, which would be counted as a single column.  We need to count them as zero column.\r\n- Multiple code points can be combined together and look like a single character when they are rendered.  They are called combining characters or grapheme clusters.  (E.g., umlaut letters, emoji with skin color.)  Those characters should be counted together.",
      "Also, I'm a little worried about performance here. `char_width()` is obviously going to be slower than `len()`, but will this noticeably affect Black's overall performance?\r\n\r\nPossible optimizations:\r\n- Use a fast path for ascii-only strings (`str.isascii` method), since many programs will contain mostly ASCII-only strings\r\n- Cache the result of the computation per string; this is only helpful if we often re-compute the width for the same string",
      "I added a fast path for ASCII-only strings as well!",
      "Consider using [wcwidth](https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth)? In my experience in other projects this is more accurate for control characters, non-asian characters, etc. (see [this](https://github.com/masaccio/compact-json/issues/4#issuecomment-1357049123))\r\nAlso wcwidth uses `lru_cache` which should be helpful for the performance\r\n\r\n",

      "There also exist packages like [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich/blob/master/rich/cells.py) who generates a table with a tool script depend on `wcwidth` so that the package itself does not need it as dependency. Same strategy can be adopted here as well. I personally prefer using existing packages instead of copying the code though",
      "Looks like `wcwidth` is a pure-Python package with no further dependencies, so it wouldn't be too bad to add.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am a little concerned about making formatting output depend on a third-party package. Right now if you have the same version of Black installed as someone else, you'll get the same formatting. But with wcwidth, perhaps different versions of the library will count line length differently, which would cause different formatting. That could create a confusing experience for users. We could get around it by pinning wcwidth to a specific version, but that's not great either.",
      "If we want to use wcwidth, I'd prefer using a mechanism similar to rich to avoid the issues Jelle brings up. Otherwise pinning is \"fine,\" but that's not great either (may cause dependency conflicts for some users if they use another tool that uses wcwidth). I'm kinda surprised rich seems to use a binary search instead of a dictionary lookup, but maybe there's some complexity I'm overlooking?",
      "> I'm kinda surprised rich seems to use a binary search instead of a dictionary lookup, but maybe there's some complexity I'm overlooking?\r\n\r\nActually wcwidth itself is already using bisearch. To my understanding the key reason is that the width information is stored as a interval table instead of a full dictionary. A full dictionary for every unicode character would have ~a million records i guess, but the interval table consists of only ~500 records, as a block of  characters tend to have same width.\r\nThe rich implementation differs from the original wcwidth in that it merges bisearch table for 0-width and 2-width into a single, and that it caches width for strings with less then 512 characters for reuse.\r\n",
      "If we decide to generate Black's own table to avoid a runtime dependency on wcwidth, should the generated table be version-controlled, or should it be generated at build time (through a [PEP-517]-style custom build backend or a release script in the CI configuration)?\r\n\r\n[PEP-517]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/",
      "While writing a plugin for Hatchling (our build backend) would be super cool, it's probably not the best idea given it still gives room for install-to-install variability as Jelle brought up. It would be rare given almost no one installs from sdist, but the possibility is still there. Extending our release CD would be nice, but we haven't tried adding any automated source changes before and in general it sounds like it could devolve into a debugging nightmare. Doing it the rich way (feel free to add the new logic in subpackage of the Black package) would probably be best (assuming running the generate table script from time to time is basically we all we need to do).\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd like @JelleZijlstra's input.",
      "Generating a file and checking it in seems like the best way. That way, we can make sure it stays the same for the whole year and keep the stable style stable.",
      "Now `char_width()` depends on the generated `wcwidth()` table instead of `unicodedata.east_asian_width()`, and it's LRU-cached.  I also changed the fast path condition of `str_width()` to address [what @ZeroRin pointed out](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3445#discussion_r1062985596).  The script to generate the table is placed in *scripts/make_width_table.py*, and the generated table is in *black/_width_table.py*.\r\n\r\n@JelleZijlstra Could you take a look again?",

      "Let string splitters respect `East_Asian_Width` property (#3445)\n\nThis patch changes the preview style so that string splitters respect\r\nUnicode East Asian Width[^1] property.  If you are not familiar to CJK\r\nlanguages it is not clear immediately.  Let me elaborate with some\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, East Asian characters (including punctuation) have\r\ntaken up space twice than European letters and stops when they are\r\nrendered in monospace typeset.  Compare the following characters:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcdefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe characters at the first line are half-width, and the second line\r\nare full-width.  (Also note that the last character with a small\r\ncircle, the East Asian period, is also full-width.)  Therefore, if we\r\nwant to prevent those full-width characters to exceed the maximum\r\ncolumns per line, we need to count their *width* rather than the number\r\nof characters.  Again, the following characters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are just 4 characters, but their total width is 8.\r\n\r\nSuppose we want to maintain up to 4 columns per line with the following\r\ntext:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcdefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow should it be then?  We want it to look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcd\r\nefg.\r\n글、\r\n字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, Black currently turns it into like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcd\r\nefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's because Black currently counts the number of characters in the line\r\ninstead of measuring their width. So, how could we measure the width?\r\nHow can we tell if a character is full- or half-width? What if half-width\r\ncharacters and full-width ones are mixed in a line? That's why Unicode\r\ndefined an attribute named `East_Asian_Width`. Unicode grouped every\r\nsingle character according to their width in fixed-width typeset.\r\n\r\nThis partially addresses #1197, but only for string splitters. The other\r\nparts need to be fixed as well in future patches.\r\n\r\nThis was implemented by copying rich's own approach to handling wide\r\ncharacters: generate a table using wcwidth, check it into source\r\ncontrol, and use in to drive helper functions in Black's logic. This\r\ngets us the best of both worlds: accuracy and performance (and let's us\r\nupdate as per our stability policy too!).\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jelle Zijlstra <jelle.zijlstra@gmail.com>"

      "Notes from diff-shades:\r\n\r\n```\r\n             queryset = queryset.extra(\r\n                 select={\r\n                     \"_prefetch_related_val_%s\"\r\n-                    % f.attname: \"%s.%s\"\r\n-                    % (qn(join_table), qn(f.column))\r\n+                    % f.attname: \"%s.%s\" % (qn(join_table), qn(f.column))\r\n                     for f in fk.local_related_fields\r\n                 }\r\n             )\r\n```\r\nNote that both the key and the value in the dictcomp use `%` formatting. Looks a little weird, maybe we should put the key and value on separate lines. Seems out of scope for this PR though.\r\n\r\nPandas has a similarly odd-looking case with a `+` in the key:\r\n```\r\n         tests = [\r\n             (\r\n                 BusinessHour(),\r\n                 {\r\n                     Timestamp(\"2014-07-04 15:00\")\r\n-                    + Nano(5): Timestamp(\"2014-07-04 16:00\")\r\n-                    + Nano(5),\r\n+                    + Nano(5): Timestamp(\"2014-07-04 16:00\") + Nano(5),\r\n                     Timestamp(\"2014-07-04 16:00\")\r\n-                    + Nano(5): Timestamp(\"2014-07-07 09:00\")\r\n-                    + Nano(5),\r\n+                    + Nano(5): Timestamp(\"2014-07-07 09:00\") + Nano(5),\r\n                     Timestamp(\"2014-07-04 16:00\")\r\n-                    - Nano(5): Timestamp(\"2014-07-04 17:00\")\r\n-                    - Nano(5),\r\n+                    - Nano(5): Timestamp(\"2014-07-04 17:00\") - Nano(5),\r\n                 },\r\n             ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise I like the changes from the PR: they make it easier to see when one dict key ends and the next one begins, because values get indented.",

      "I have created a [comment](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3044#issuecomment-1366026400) on #3044, but as this here is the issue that has been merged, I am providing my thought here again.\r\n\r\nAfter going over the issue I am a little bit puzzled now, as I am not really sure what the intended behavior should be.\r\n\r\nMy assumption was that black should not apply reformattings which will introduce new line length violations. In my opinion this sounds reasonable, given that you might have a processing pipeline where e.g. flake8 is doing its job hereafter and would fail (like in my case). But it looks like the resolution for this issue is going in another direction.\r\n\r\nMy view: For the [example](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3044#issuecomment-1364710654) I have provided black needs to take a decision: either reformatting to a one-line string and violating the maximum line length, or, leaving the doc string as it is and keeping the conformity.\r\n\r\nMy preference is clearly to keep the conformity, but if I understand the resolution here correctly, reformatting to a one-line string is given priority. I am not in favor of this as special crafting of the doc string by the developer just to work around this issue would go against the philosophy of black.\r\n\r\nSo would it be reasonable not to reformat the doc string for the example I provided?",
      "The crux of the problem here is that Black shouldn't move quotes that already violate the line length limit onto a new line (it's ugly and isn't compliant with PEP 257), but _also_ shouldn't move quotes that were already on their own line. This is impossible to do w/ Black's philosophy of avoiding looking at the original formatting as much as possible.  \r\n\r\nI agree Black shouldn't cause more violations of the line length limit. Technically this introduces one more situation where Black is dependant on pre-existing formatting, but I don't think docstrings can be formatted in an \"one size for all\" way IMHO.",
      "I do know nothing about black's internals, but for the example I provided would it be possible to implement something like this for one-line doc strings:\r\n\r\nOriginal code (maximum line length not exceeded):\r\n```\r\nclass _YamlBlockStyle(str):\r\n    \"\"\"Class used to indicate that a string shall be serialized using the block style.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat black produces currently (one-line doc string, maximum line length exceeded):\r\n```\r\nclass _YamlBlockStyle(str):\r\n    \"\"\"Class used to indicate that a string shall be serialized using the block style.\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I propose black could produce (multi-line doc string, maximum line length not exceeded):\r\n```\r\nclass _YamlBlockStyle(str):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Class used to indicate that a string shall be serialized using the block style.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that output would comply to the maximum line length as well as to PEP 257. If the latter output would still exceed the maximum line length, then of course there is nothing black can do. ",
      "If I'm understanding correctly, this PR re-introduces the following issues: #1632, #2274, #3331?\r\n\r\nIt's great that we're now PEP 257 compliant, but now black reformats my code such that flake8 complains about line length. What's the suggested approach for users using both black and flake8, to add `# noqa: E501` to every docstring in this situation? I would argue that this is uglier than having the closing triple quotes on a separate line..."

      "This idea can be generalized to other aspects of the mode: run the stability/equivalence tests only while setting some part of the mode to the opposite of what the test normally does. I tried locally and found that every new configuration adds about 4 s to the test runtime. The most interesting configuration was setting line-length to 1, which found #3424, #3425, #3427, and #3428. Setting `is_pyi` to true found #3427.\r\n\r\nI'm going to add a case that does line length = 1, preview = False, because that configuration seems to be good at catching bugs.",
      "> Is it clear when the secondary format runs are the ones erroring out? I just don't want this to confuse contributors unfamiliar with our testing setup.\r\n\r\nI pushed a change that wraps failures from these checks to hopefully make it clear.\r\n\r\n> I'm not happy that this quadruples the runtime of the `test_format.py` tests (12s -> 45s), but c'est la vie.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's going to be quite so bad, where did you get that number from?

When black corrected all my formatting mistakes and then I run it again (just in case) I saw following message (**TRIGGER WARNING**):  \r\n\r\n`All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨`\r\n\r\nAnd I was schocked. I did not even realise how hungry I was, and the cake looked to delicious. I should add that I'm trying to loose weight. This delightful piece of confectionery art woke my deepest and darkest instincts. I relapsed and went to the corner store to buy chocolate.  \r\n\r\nI do not want anyone else to suffer as I did. So I added `--lean` flag which you can use to remove the cake from output.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [X] Add an entry in `CHANGES.md` if necessary?\r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [X] Add new / update outdated documentation?",

      "Can someone verify that the test output is correct? I checked some simplified versions of the test and used that was my reference for what the output should be.",
      "Does this overlap with #3370?",
      "#3370 doesn't fix this issue, though some of the changes should make this easier. It probably has more overlap with #2052.",
      "#2052 does seem to be the same problem, making #3268 a duplicate of it.",
      "So I did some code coverage comparison and lines 207 and 208 in `lines.py` seem to be behind the problem. https://github.com/psf/black/blob/8429ebc2eabdd3ec984505ccff265e692cb49f7d/src/black/lines.py#L195-L210\r\n\r\nI ran two test minimal test cases with code coverage, shown below.\r\n```\r\n# failing\r\n[1,][\r\n    2\r\n](3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# passing\r\n[\r\n    1,\r\n][2]()\r\n```\r\nThe failing test did not run lines 207 and 208, while the passing test did. ~The issue seems to be that parentheses pairs that are empty do not cause the last leaf to be shifted back and for them to be marked as ignored.~ (mixed up the tests)\r\n\r\nSome other test cases which more clearly show the issue are below.\r\n```\r\n# passing\r\n[\r\n    1,\r\n]()()()()\r\n\r\n# passing regardless of which parentheses pair the 2 is in as long as there is only one\r\n[\r\n    1,\r\n](2)()()()\r\n\r\n# failing if two or more of the entries are filled\r\n[1,](\r\n    2\r\n)(2)()()\r\n```",
      "Some other missed lines in the buggy test case are 116 and 216 in `black/brackets.py` and 1162-1163 and 1227-1228 in `black/linegen.py`. It's very interesting how the buggy test case has reduced coverage despite having a single extra character.\r\n\r\n",
      "So a clear point where things go wrong is in `black/brackets.py:116`. In the `mark` function for the buggy test case, `,` never has a depth of 0, which means the comma is never marked as a delimiter with `COMMA_PRIORITY`.",
      "So the problem that I'm finding is that `generate_trailers_to_omit` in `linegen.py` is breaking early after having 2 non-empty pairs of brackets. This is why the test cases in https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3377#issuecomment-1311239582 fail.\r\n```\r\n# passing\r\n[\r\n    1,\r\n]()()()()\r\n\r\n# passing regardless of which parentheses pair the 2 is in as long as there is only one\r\n[\r\n    1,\r\n](2)()()()\r\n\r\n# failing if two or more of the entries are filled\r\n[1,](\r\n    2\r\n)(2)()()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI moved the `yield` to the end of the loop, but this does cause a regression with `trailing_comma_optional_parens2`. It also does not completely fix multiple internal magic commas. Some sample failing cases are below.\r\n```\r\n# input\r\n[1,](3,)\r\n\r\n# expected output\r\n[\r\n    1,\r\n](\r\n    3,\r\n)\r\n\r\n# actual output\r\n[1,](\r\n    3,\r\n)\r\n```",
      "So in general, in the case of several magic commas on the same line, unless there is not enough room on the line, only the rightmost one will be forcefully split. Is this intended behavior? The documentation suggests that *Black* will always expand the collection to fit, but this is clearly not the case.",

      "I looked at a few of the diff-shades changes and I'm unfortunately not a fan; they mostly seem like gratuitous changes that don't make the formatting better. Can this fix be limited to only cases where a magic trailing comma is present?",
      "I'm not sure what changes to make at this point. One problem has to do with sibling-level magic trailing commas. In `right_hand_split`, with something like `[1,][3,]`, it comes out with `head = \"[1,][\"`, `body=\"3,\"`, and `tail=\"]\"`. I think is is going to require a more significant rewrite to handle that possibility, and I'm still not familiar enough with the library to be comfortable doing that.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the \"fix\" that I made changes how long lines are handled by always returning all trailers found by `generate_trailers_to_omit`, which is why there are regressions like below.

      "> Thanks for your contribution!\n> \n> Monkeypatching `sys.stdout` feels quite risky though. A few questions:\n\n> - What will happen on Windows terminals that use an encoding incompatible with UTF-8? I'm worried we'll get mojibake in that case.\n\nThis isn't possible on ~\"modern\" Windows terminals (which I means Windows 10+, even the built in CMD.exe understands utf-8)\n\nAlso from python 3.7+ the output is utf8 when stdout is connected to a TTY, so this disparity only occurs when not in a TTY.\n\nSo in short I think the risk of mojibake is tiny. And whatever risk there is already applies without this change and you'd get an encoding error on trying to convert the extended unicode emoji character into cp1252.\n\nOne option I could do here is to limit this to Windows 10+. They should remove the risk entirely.\n\n> - Could this be fixed in `click` instead? We use `click.echo` to output all emoji, and `click` is supposed to take care of output encoding for us.\n\nIt can, but for some reason it felt like a more disruptive change to make there rather then just to a single project (black) that we know we already expect to be able to print utf-8/high unicode.\n\n> - The `pycln` issue reported getting `UnicodeEncodeError`, while the OP of the Black issue saw literal `\\u1234` output instead. Do you know why that is?\n\nI suspect the Unicode escape is something to do with how the output is captured by pre-commit. I can dig into that more if you'd like confirmation \n",
      "This is funny to even mention but since Black works on Python 3.7+, it will run on Windows 7, ~~8~~, 8.1, 10, and 11. ~~Maybe even Vista 😂~~\r\n\r\nPython 3.9 and newer don't support Windows 7 but still support ~~8~~ 8.1+.\r\n\r\nSo, while decreasingly likely, it is certainly possible for a user of an older Windows to run Black. I would add the version check to avoid regressions. Skipping an emoji and showing `\\Uxxx` is less disruptive than mojibake.\r\n\r\nedit: turns out Python's requirements are [Visual Studio 2017 requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2017/vs2017-system-requirements-vs) which means no Windows Vista and Windows 8 for you. Windows 7 and 8.1 is fine.",
      "So adding a `int(platform..release()) > 10` sounds like a safer way of doing this then?\r\n\r\n```python console\r\n>>> platform.uname()\r\nuname_result(system='Windows', node='sinope', release='10', version='10.0.22621', machine='AMD64')\r\n>>> platform.release()\r\n'10'\r\n```",
      "Ah I've done a bit of digging and technically it's not even all versions of windows 10, but anyone since the Creators update, build 1809, so I'll make the check even more detailed.\r\n\r\n(And I've checked that this will still work on Github Actions too. On Server 2022 it returns `10.0.20348` for the version.",
      "Any other comments or changes requested @ambv @JelleZijlstra?",
      "Coming back to this, I'm not enthusiastic about including this in Black:\r\n\r\n- We're monkeypatching the standard library, always a risky thing to do, and we're doing it only in a particular set of obscure conditions (when pytest is absent and we're on a particular version of Windows). That feels like a future maintainability nightmare.\r\n- Printing unicode isn't a core part of what Black is about. We're using Click to create Unicode-compatible output, so I feel like it should be Click's job to fix Unicode issues here. If Click doesn't think it's worth fixing, maybe that's a hint that we shouldn't either.\r\n- The bug this fixes isn't particularly bad. Emojis get printed as \"\\u1234\" sequences, which is ugly but doesn't make Black unusable.",
      "If we don't accept this (and I entirely understand why) is there perhaps a place in the docs that I could document the work around to users (setting `PYTHONUTF8=1`)?",
      "Mentioning that workaround in the docs seems fine.",
      "One comment on the \"We're monkeypatching the standard library, always a risky thing to do\" -- if that is the only concern then I could replace the `sys.stdout = ...` with [contextlib.redirect_stdout](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.redirect_stdout)",

Trailing comma in a RHS tuple isn't handled:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-        (\r\n-            field,\r\n-            targets,\r\n-            alias,\r\n-            joins,\r\n-            path,\r\n-            opts,\r\n-            transform_function,\r\n-        ) = self._setup_joins(pieces, opts, alias)\r\n+        (field, targets, alias, joins, path, opts, transform_function,) = (\r\n+            self._setup_joins(pieces, opts, alias)\r\n+        )\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. There are some unrelated changes where the RHS of an assignment statement has un-nested pairs of inner parens, example:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n             clone.external_aliases[alias] = (\r\n-                isinstance(table, Join)\r\n-                and table.join_field.related_model._meta.db_table != alias\r\n-            ) or (\r\n-                isinstance(table, BaseTable) and table.table_name != table.table_alias\r\n+                (\r\n+                    isinstance(table, Join)\r\n+                    and table.join_field.related_model._meta.db_table != alias\r\n+                )\r\n+                or (\r\n+                    isinstance(table, BaseTable)\r\n+                    and table.table_name != table.table_alias\r\n+                )\r\n             )\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. This is bad:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n         y_hat_discrete[\r\n             np.arange(y_hat_probas.shape[0]), y_hat_probas.argmax(axis=1)\r\n-        ] = 1\r\n+        ] = (1)\r\n```",
      "I was going to point out 1. but you beat me :)\r\n\r\nI don't think 2. is a problem: the parentheses around each `and` are preserved, it just adds new parentheses around the whole RHS.",
      "I noticed this one:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-    df[\"category\"] = Series(\r\n-        np.array(list(\"abcdefghij\")).take(np.random.randint(0, 10, size=n))\r\n-    ).astype(\"category\")\r\n+    df[\"category\"] = (\r\n+        Series(\r\n+            np.array(list(\"abcdefghij\")).take(np.random.randint(0, 10, size=n))\r\n+        ).astype(\"category\")\r\n+    )\r\n```\r\nwhich I realize is another example of what you meant by 2.",
      "Also wanted to mention that most of the changes in diff-shades are clear improvements. This is going to be a positive change.",
      "Adding a note, looks like the handling of trailing comma on the left side is related to an existing issue:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(\r\n    a,\r\n    b,\r\n    c,\r\n    d,\r\n) = func1(arg1)\r\n\r\n(a, b, c, d,) = func1(\r\n    arg1\r\n) and func2(arg2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[playground link](https://black.vercel.app/?version=stable&state=_Td6WFoAAATm1rRGAgAhARYAAAB0L-Wj4ACwAGtdAD2IimZxl1N_WhQ0lZ8ePG18SrWnqEXm6MEpBB5Xxo7HNC1DU--HVO-aJQWwg_6UCkhbjSObDxvgZLassYf5fne9JNRJzx1OVHomO9iFUp1rOQhdodRYLgcwob9p60Ag9Sxa4HwqP5v4KEoAAAA4Z-SjB7OHFQABhwGxAQAAxZqMWbHEZ_sCAAAAAARZWg==)\r\n\r\nMaybe #1671?",

      "I have to say that adding linting to blib2to3 has raised some pretty egregious code. I think it's worth splitting some of the changes to another PR. So this PR would be adding linting to that dir and maybe fixing just some minor flake8 failures, but anything that requires serious fixing I can add noqa to that line and open separate PRs to remove the noqas so we can discuss the code changes.",
      "The PR seems fine, but I'm not a big fan of the `token` -> `token_mod` changes, it doesn't seem worth it. ",
      "> The PR seems fine, but I'm not a big fan of the `token` -> `token_mod` changes, it doesn't seem worth it.\r\n\r\nLet me give you an example that hopefully convinces you.  The original import is \r\n`from blib2to3.pgen2 import token`\r\n\r\nany code such as this\r\n```\r\ndef printtoken(type, token, xxx_todo_changeme, xxx_todo_changeme1, line):  # for testing\r\n    (srow, scol) = xxx_todo_changeme\r\n    (erow, ecol) = xxx_todo_changeme1\r\n    print(\r\n        \"%d,%d-%d,%d:\\t%s\\t%s\"\r\n        % (srow, scol, erow, ecol, token.tok_name[type], repr(token))\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nhas a `token` argument which is clearly overriding the import `token` name. In fact, when `token.tok_name` is called, attempting to index the `tok_name` dict in token.py, it thinks we're indexing the `token` argument. This is pretty egregious code (no offense to original authors....)\r\n\r\nSo modifying the import is absolutely necessary, though other options could be renaming the variable names instead of the import, changing `token.py` module name to something else, etc. Happy to hear preferred alternatives, but for now an import alias was the easiest to do.",

In all of these cases, we compare the files that\r\nare visible by Black with a known list of paths containing the\r\nexpected values.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix introduced in the previous commit, these tests failed\r\nwhen the .gitignore file was nested (second case).

Commit message of the commit that fixed the bug:\r\n\r\nWhen passing multiple src directories, the root gitignore was only applied to the first processed source. The reason is that, in the first source, exclude is `None`, but then the value gets overridden by `re_compile_maybe_verbose(DEFAULT_EXCLUDES)`, so in the next iteration where the source is a directory, the condition is not met and sets the value of `gitignore` to `None`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem, we set the new value of `exclude` is a new variable (`_exclude`). This prevents entering the wrong condition on the second iteration and also keeps the origina value if the condition is not met.\r\n\r\nAlso, the value of both `_exclude` and `gitignore` is calculated only once by using `None` as default value. This help us to reduce the number of computations (only calculate the value once, if needed), and also retains the original value of `gitignore`, which is then merged with the value of `p_gitignore`. That's why we also define `_gitignore` to contain the result of the merge (add) operation.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

It is also still inconsistent with how `with` statements are proposed to be formatted in the future.\r\n\r\nThis adds to the Vim plugin its own indent script that can be run when the `g:black_indent` flag is enabled. It uses Vim's own Python indent except for cases where it is inconsistent, and sets the configs itself to be as consistent with Black as possible.\r\n\r\nThe flag is disabled by default since I think it's reasonable to assume that many Vim users probably already have a plugin to do this.

      "Thank you for the submission! We're not active with the Vim plugin because none of the current maintainers really use it. So this could take a while since it's actually doing new stuff. Any experts in the ether listening? 😅",
      "Makes sense, I'll admit to definitely *not* being an expert in Vim plugins. I've been testing it on Vim 9.0.354-1 and 8.2.2434-3, and Neovim 0.8.0-3 and 0.4.4-1, just to see if I miss anything version related. I also ran:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nfind -regex \".*\\\\.py\" -exec vim -c \"normal =G\" -c wq \"{}\" \";\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nin `src` to see how it indents which is an okay way to check for holes, which the code still has (indentation breaks if a comment comes after an open parenthesis for example), so this is a lot more of a work in progress than I initially thought making the PR.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I don't think it's a good idea to keep trying to do this by patching the inconsistent parts of the built in `indentexpr` because there are bound to be some non-obvious ones I don't account for like the comments issue I mentioned earlier. It's probably better to just forget about trying to fix what's broken and make a standalone `indentexpr` function. It'll be a bit more effort but nothing that Vim breaks would affect it.\r\n\r\nIf you think that's a good idea, I just want to verify: should it be as opinionated as Black itself? By that I mean should it be written under the assumption that the user is already trying to stick with the style and isn't trying to do things like:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef test(aaaaaaaaaaaa,\r\n         bbbbbbbbbbbb,\r\n         cccccccccccc):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming they won't even try to do things like this should make it simpler to write by just not considering the cases like this, so if they try something like this it might indent *completely* wrong, but as long as they follow the style it would work exactly as expected. How I see it, if they don't want to use the Black format while writing code they shouldn't be using the Black plugin as the indent script and just keep it disabled. Also, if something breaks indentation wise it could be used as a hint that they aren't following the style as they write. That would also include making it to where enabling the plugin's indent would also set `shiftwidth=4` and `expandtab` (indent width and spaces instead of tabs respectively) regardless of user values (Vim does too but gives you the option to disable it, which I don't think would fit).",
      "I've updated the script to use its own standalone `indentexpr` function that assumes the user is going to already be writing in the Black style. This turned out to be a very good idea since:\r\n\r\n1. The original script was a bit more buggy than I originally thought, and hacked together to rely on Vim staying consistent. Rewriting to be self sufficient means only consulting the single script for any issues ran into in the future.\r\n2. The new script is consistent. Running the `find` command from the last comment in `src` with the old script used to reindent a few files, while the new script changes none of them.\r\n1. The new script is *significantly* faster. I'm talking almost an order of magnitude. Running that `find` command in a virtual machine on `src` used to take ~2m20s. The same command with the new script takes less than 15 seconds.\r\n2. I haven't tested it but I'm almost certain the new script works on Vim versions at least as old as 7 like the rest of the Vim plugin requires, and probably much older. The old script I wasn't so sure of.\r\n\r\nI'm still of the opinion that not even worrying about trying to indent code that's inconsistent with the style is beneficial since it keeps the code simpler and if they don't want to write code according to Black they can just keep the flag disabled and use whatever script they typically use. If you disagree then I can try to flesh it out a bit more, but if not I think the script as it is now is perfectly usable.",
      "Maybe it would make more sense to extract this as a standalone vim plugin? It would be easier to install, and the black maintainers don't need to deal with any issues that crops up.\r\n\r\nBTW, I found this existing plugin https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/vim-python-indent-black, but I don't know how it compares to this implementation.",
      "I think making a standalone repo is the way to go. Most (Neo)vim package managers tend to install the entire repository, which means installing Black twice for anyone that wants to use it as a Vim plugin (I don't). A lone plugin like the one you posted makes more sense if someone just wants the indentation.\r\n\r\nAs Felix said, no one officially maintains the Vim plugin (I sure wasn't planning on it), so it would be rarely-useful code that would inevitably go out of date and no one would understand. All that said, it's been open for over a year. There's clearly not enough of a demand for that to be worth it. I'll close this."

      "> would it make sense to consider the comments to be in the block? Instead of having an outer \"semantic comment\" I'm not 100 % sure, but that could simplify things so that we can use ordinary newline rules for the whole block.\r\n\r\nThis is appealing. But I tried and couldn't yet find a way to actually simplify this by considering the comments to be in the block.\r\n\r\nTo decide whether a comment belongs to this block, we have to examine what the block is, as well as [the newlines in the first leaf prefix](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/b60b85b234d6a575f636d0a125478115f993c90c/src/black/lines.py#L488-L493).

      "Just though of something... What if the first line ends with a different character than the second line? For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nLine skipped using -x but ends with \\n\r\n\"First source code line, ending with \\r\\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the `newline` argument for `format_file_contents` is defined according to the first line (`decode_bytes`), and then the first line is skipped. In this example, `decode_bytes` will return `newline = \"\\n\"` (first line) but the first not-skipped line will end in `\\r\\n`. This is what happens in the current implementation. If this is a problem, maybe `decode_bytes` should know if the first line is skipped and define `newline` according to the second line of the file (if present), but I'm not sure what's the expected behavior or even if its relevant enough now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBTW, adding an argument seems a bit too much now, because my current implementation (WIP locally) only uses the `newline` argument when the first line is skipped, but the value is not passed further. Maybe applying the partition on `\"\\n\"` is the best approach at the moment since a line ending in `\\r\\n` should be split too (`\\r` will remain untouched as part of the header)\r\n"

By enabling the\r\nflag, using `-x` or `--skip-source-first-line`, the first line is\r\nremoved temporarilly while the remaining contents are formatted.

First,\r\nBlack is invoked without enabling the flag which should result in an\r\nexit code different than 0.

      "Now I think about it, this PR is effectively proposing the ability to use a single `# fmt: off` to turn off formatting by scope. Not sure about maintainers' opinion, but I think this improves ergonomics a lot. This also matches Pylint's `# pylint: disable=` pragma behavior, so it can be familiar to Pylint users. I do like to see this being supported.\r\n\r\nYou can already use a single `# fmt: off` at the top level to turn off formatting for everything below, though I don't see this explicitly documented.",

    "body": "## Background\r\n\r\nHello there! The Python packaging ecosystem has standardized on the interface for build backends ([PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)/[PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/)) and the format for metadata declaration ([PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)/[PEP 631](https://peps.python.org/pep-0631/)). As a result, the execution of `setup.py` files is now [deprecated](https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html).\r\n\r\nSo, I'm spending my free time updating important projects so that they are modernized and set an example for others 😄\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis implements [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/), obviating the need for `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, and `MANIFEST.in`. The build backend `hatchling` (of which I am a maintainer in the [PyPA](https://github.com/pypa)) is now used as that is the default in the official [Python packaging tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/). Hatchling is available on all the major distribution channels such as [Debian](https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/packages/hatchling), [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-hatchling), [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/python-hatchling/), [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hatchling), [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/python-modules/hatchling/default.nix), [Alpine Linux](https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/blob/master/community/py3-hatchling/APKBUILD), [FreeBSD](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/blob/main/devel/py-hatchling/Makefile)/[OpenBSD](https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/devel/py-hatchling/Makefile), [Gentoo Linux](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/tree/master/dev-python/hatchling), [MacPorts](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/blob/master/python/py-hatchling/Portfile), [OpenEmbedded](https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded-core/commit/846e806181f1349be29cbce78c5041735dfd7e6f), [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/py-hatchling/package.py), etc.\r\n\r\n### Python support\r\n\r\nThe earliest supported Python 3 version of Hatchling is 3.7, therefore I've also set that as the minimum here. Python 3.6 is EOL and other build backends like `flit-core` and `setuptools` also dropped support. Python 3.6 accounted for 3-4% of downloads in the last month: https://pypistats.org/packages/black\r\n\r\n@ichard26 mentioned this was already planned for Soon ™️ so feel free to keep this open until then!\r\n\r\n### Plugins\r\n\r\nConfiguration is now completely static with the help of 3 plugins.\r\n\r\n#### Readme\r\n\r\n@hynek's [hatch-fancy-pypi-readme](https://github.com/hynek/hatch-fancy-pypi-readme) allows for the dynamic construction of the Readme which was previously coded up in `setup.py`. Now it's simply:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.fancy-pypi-readme]\r\ncontent-type = \"text/markdown\"\r\nfragments = [\r\n  { path = \"README.md\" },\r\n  { path = \"CHANGES.md\" },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Versioning\r\n\r\n[hatch-vcs](https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs) is currently just a wrapper around `setuptools-scm` (which despite the legacy naming is actually now decoupled from `setuptools`):\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[tool.hatch.version]\r\nsource = \"vcs\"\r\n\r\n[tool.hatch.build.hooks.vcs]\r\nversion-file = \"src/_black_version.py\"\r\ntemplate = '''\r\nversion = \"{version}\"\r\n'''\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Mypyc\r\n\r\n[hatch-mypyc](https://github.com/ofek/hatch-mypyc) offers many benefits over the existing approach:\r\n\r\n- No need to manually select files for inclusion\r\n- Avoids the need for the current CI workaround for https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc/issues/946\r\n- Intermediate artifacts (like `build/`) from `setuptools` and Mypyc itself no longer clutter the project directory\r\n- Runtime dependencies required at build time no longer need to be manually redeclared as this is a [built-in option](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#dependencies_1) of Hatchling\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- To spot check my work here, there are a bunch of examples linked on the [users page](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/users/). A decent one to look at might be `urllib3` since they just switched.\r\n- `hatch-mypyc` doesn't support env vars for things like the debug level, I can add that soon though.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [X] Add new / update outdated documentation?",

      "Update stable branch after publishing to PyPI (#3223)\n\nWe've decided to a) convert stable back into a branch and b) to update\r\nit immediately as part of the release process. We may as well automate\r\nit. And about going back to a branch ...\r\n\r\nGit tags are not the right tool, at all[^1]. They come with the\r\nexpectation that they will never change. Things will not work as\r\nexpected if they do change, doubly so if they change regularly. Once\r\nyou pull stable from the remote and it's copied in your local\r\nrepository, no matter how many times you run git pull you'll never see\r\nit get updated automatically. Your only recourse is to delete the tag\r\nvia `git tag -d stable` before pulling.\r\n\r\nThis gets annoying really quickly since stable is supposed to be the\r\nsolution for folks \"who want to move along as Black developers deem\r\nthe newest version reliable.\"[^2] See this comment for how this impacts\r\nusers using our Vim plugin[^3]. It also affects us developers[^4]. If\r\nyou have stable locally, once we cut a new release and update the stable\r\ntag, a simple `git pull` / `git fetch` will not pull down the updated\r\nstable tag. Unless you remember to delete stable before pulling, stable\r\nwill become stale and useless.\r\n\r\nYou can argue this is a good thing (\"people should explicitly opt into\r\nupdating stable\"), but IMO it does not match user expectations nor\r\ndeveloper expectations[^5]. Especially since not all our integrations\r\nthat use stable are bound by this security measure, for example our\r\nGitHub Action (since it does a clean fetch of the repository every time\r\nit's used). I believe consistency would be good here.\r\n\r\nFinally, ever since we switched to a tag, we've been facing issues with\r\nReadTheDocs not picking up updates to stable unless we force a rebuild.\r\nThe initial rebuild on the stable update just pulls the commit the tag\r\npreviously pointed to. I'm not sure if switching back to a branch will\r\nfix this, but I'd wager it will.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag#_on_re_tagging\r\n\r\n[^2]: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing/release_process.html#moving-the-stable-tag\r\n\r\n[^3]: https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2503#issuecomment-1196357379\r\n\r\n[^4]: In fairness, most folks working on Black probably don't use the\r\n      `stable` ref anyway, especially us maintainers who'd know what is\r\n      the latest version by heart, but it'd still be nice to make it\r\n      usable for local dev though.\r\n\r\n[^5]: Also what benefit does a `stable` ref have over explicit version\r\n      tags like `22.6.0`? If you're going to opt into some odd pin\r\n      mechanism, might as well use explicit version tags for clarity\r\n      and consistency."

If we fail for whatever reason, we continue without a `target_version`.\r\n* The list of target versions should include all major Python versions allowed by the `requires-python` specifier.\r\n  * `3.8.5` becomes `[\"py38\"]`\r\n  * `>3.6,<3.11` becomes `[\"py37\", \"py38\", \"py39\", \"py310\"]`\r\n  * `<3.7` becomes `[\"py33\", \"py34\", \"py35\", \"py36\"]` (Python 3.3 is the minimal supported version for Black)\r\n\r\n_(for more examples, check the test cases)_\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Updated `parse_pyproject_toml`\r\n  * When reading the TOML file, we check if `target_version` is specified in Black's config. If not, we try to infer it from the project metadata.\r\n  * This seemed like the logical place - since we are reading the file anyway, we might aswell extract the project metadata if we need it.\r\n* Added basic functionality for reading project metadata.\r\n  * Only the PyPA standard is now supported: `project` -> `requires-python`.\r\n  * We could add support for Poetry or other tools later.\r\n* Added parsing of the version / specifier based on `packaging`'s `Version` and `SpecifierSet`\r\n  * There is some black magic (pun intended) going on in the `strip_specifier_set` function that I wrote. Unfortunately, working with these kinds of specifiers is nasty when it comes to edge cases. My implementation satisfies all specifier sets I could come up with, but there are probably some corner cases that I did not cover...\r\n* Added `packaging>=20.0` as a dependency.

    "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the [Pants build system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) to the Black repo, on an experimental basis.\r\n\r\nIt does not change any of the existing build mechanisms for running tests, formatting, linting, \r\ntypechecking, building distributions etc. Developers in this repo can remain unaware of Pants if they choose. \r\nOthers may be  interested in playing around with it.\r\n\r\nFor context: While chatting with @ambv at PyCon 2022 he expressed interest in seeing what using Pants \r\nin the Black repo would look like. This change is a proof-of-concept as a result of that conversation.\r\n\r\nNotes to reviewers: \r\n- This PR consists of several commits that, while not fully independent, are useful to review individually. Each commit's message describes in more detail what it contains. \r\n- My apologies for the size of the diff (8298 lines!). However it's not what it seems: \r\n  - 7232 lines are generated lockfiles. \r\n  - 418 lines are standard Pants runner scripts. \r\n  - 253 lines are \"BUILD file\" boilerplate and metadata, much of it also generated.\r\n  - 244 lines are the new docs/contributing/pants.md documentation file, worth reading for more detail.\r\n  - 151 lines are miscellaneous changes, and these are worth the greatest line-by-line scrutiny.\r\n  - The commit messages will help distinguish which is which.\r\n- Thanks for taking the time to review this. I'm happy to answer any questions, and the [Pants community](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/getting-help) is a good place for any questions or conversation outside the scope of this PR, if needed.\r\n\r\n##### What is Pants, and why might you want to use it? \r\n\r\nPants is a modern build system with a strong focus on Python. It installs, configures and orchestrates \r\nthe underlying tools, such as pytest, flake8, setuptools, mypy, and, of course, Black itself. Pants provides \r\na uniform CLI interface for build actions. It aims to make builds repeatable, stable, fast and secure. \r\nIt achieves these goals via features such as: dependency inference, fine-grained invalidation, caching, \r\nconcurrency, lockfiles, hermetic execution and more.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that this change doesn't require a CHANGELOG entry, since it doesn't modify\r\nBlack itself in any way, and is not user-visible. But please let me know if I am wrong about this!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please use more specific and flexible syntax to specify a PyPy version:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        python-version:\n        - 'pypy-2.7' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 2.7\n        - 'pypy-3.8' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 3.8\n        - 'pypy-3.8-v7.3.8' # Python 3.8 and PyPy 7.3.8\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - uses: actions/setup-python@v3\n      with:\n        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>See more usage examples in the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-python#specifying-a-pypy-version\">documentation</a></p>\n<h2>Update primary and restore keys for pip</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/303\">include a version of python in restore and primary cache keys for pip</a>. Besides, we add temporary fix for Windows caching <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/332\">issue</a>, that the <code>pip cache dir</code> command returns non zero exit code or writes to stderr. Moreover we updated <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/327\">node-fetch dependency</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 1.0.8</h2>\n<p>We have updated <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md#108\">actions/cache</a> dependency version to 1.0.8 to support 10GB cache upload</p>\n<h2>Support caching dependencies</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/266\">actions/setup-python#266</a>)</p>\n<h2>Caching dependencies.</h2>\n<p>The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring pip/pipenv dependencies. The <code>cache</code> input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.</p>\n<p>Besides, this release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure.</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (requirements.txt for pip or Pipfile.lock for pipenv) in the whole repository. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when you want to override current behaviour and use different file for hash generation (for example requirements-dev.txt). This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Caching pip dependencies:</h3>\n<pre><code>steps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n- uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n  with:\n    python-version: '3.9'\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This adds, in my tests, between 35 and 45 ms to Vim load time (which I know isn't a lot but it's also unnecessary). Moving the call to `exists('g:load_black')` to before the call to `has('python3')` removes this unnecessary test and speeds up loading.\r\n\r\nHere is `nvim --startuptime` output for the plugin as written up to loading black.vim (note the 35ms load time due to sourcing python providers):\r\n\r\n~~~\r\ntimes in msec\r\n clock   self+sourced   self:  sourced script\r\n clock   elapsed:

      "Move test for g:load_black to improve plugin performance (GH-2896)\n\nIf a vim/neovim user wishes to suppress loading the vim plugin by\r\nsetting g:load_black in their VIMRC (for me, Arch linux automatically\r\nadds the plugin to Neovim's RTP, even though I'm not using it), the\r\ncurrent location of the test comes after a call to has('python3'). This\r\nadds, in my tests, between 35 and 45 ms to Vim load time (which I know\r\nisn't a lot but it's also unnecessary). Moving the call to\r\n`exists('g:load_black')` to before the call to `has('python3')` removes\r\nthis unnecessary test and speeds up loading.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Richard Si <63936253+ichard26@users.noreply.github.com>"

Reading through the discussion, there seemed (to me, at least) to be general support for normalising this.\r\n\r\nThis does two things. For very short docstrings,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Why is this on its own line?\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"Why is this on its own line?\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nand for docstrings of more than one line, a single newline at the start and (pre-indent) end are enforced, so\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    \r\n    Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nboth become\r\n```python\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Words\r\n\r\n    More words\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nwhich seemed to be the more popular style (compared with having no newline line at the start) in the #144 thread.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, any docstring with only one line of content will be converted to the one-line form. This may be problematic if it is very long, but I'm not sure what the line-length limit should be if this were changed: the normal line length limit, or 72 characters as specified by PEP 8 (which I'm not sure actually applies to single-line docstrings), or something else?\r\n\r\nI changed some tests files where the docstring formatting didn’t seem relevant, so as not to have two copies of too many test files.\r\n\r\nI didn’t reformat Black’s own source code with this change. There are parts of Black’s source that are already affected by `--preview`, so maybe this should change at the same time.\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n",

number of breaking improvements.</p>\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/compare/v0.16.1...v0.17.0\">v0.16.1...v0.17.0</a></p>\n<h3>‼️ Markdown link resolution improvements</h3>\n<p>Markdown links are of the format <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/link)</code>.\nMyST-Parser looks to smartly resolve such links, by identifying if they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A link to an external resource, e.g. <code>[text](http://example.com)</code></li>\n<li>A link to another source document, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.md)</code>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>header-anchors</code> are enabled, anchor links are also supported, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/file.md#anchor)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A link to an internal sphinx cross-reference, e.g. <code>[text](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/my-reference)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>an additional situation is now supported:</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>A link to a source

    "body": "Resolves #2727 \r\n## Core Idea\r\nThe current parser; even when it is backtracking, builds nodes which is a terrible waste of time since every time we see a `match` or `case`, we need to copy the whole stack over and over in order to preserve the actual structure and not do any modifications on top of it. This is obviously not cheap. \r\n\r\nThe following implementation does something very similar to old school state machines, where the parser is temporarily converted into a structure that tells you whether it accepts an input or not. It doesn't build any trees, at all. Which cuts a lot of time (see the benchmarks below). We simply change the parser's mode to accept-only from accept-and-build-tree when we are backtracking, and once we have the rule to follow, we switch back. \r\n\r\nThe implementation is obviously not really straightforward, because lib2to3's code is very old and it is kind of hard to move pieces around. I did not want to make much modification to regular functions, in order to not cause any additional breakage. We simply change `push`/`pop`/`shift` from functions that create / modify nodes to functions that only modify the parser's state/transition table. This way, we don't need to copy the new nodes on each modification.\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\nBenchmarking script is available [here](https://gist.github.com/isidentical/325325766daf7d3588b50704ef7bf064) (thanks to @ichard26 for sharing it with me).\r\n\r\n> It'd be really appreciated if someone can also re-test these and share their results as well, for further verification.\r\n\r\nAn example that doesn't contain any PEP 634 syntax, but contains a lot of `match`/`case` keywords: [example.py](https://gist.github.com/isidentical/76d8b5e1777541d871ef1c4016952681).\r\n```\r\n-t py39 (main):: Mean +- std dev: 7.21 ms +- 0.25 ms\r\n-t py39 (this branch):: Mean +- std dev: 7.25 ms +- 0.27 ms\r\n\r\n-t py310 (main):: Mean +- std dev: 41.7 ms +- 2.5 ms\r\n-t py310 (this branch):: Mean +- std dev: 13.8 ms +- 0.6 ms\r\n```\r\nFrom what I can interpret, this means that for `-t py310` there is a speed-up of ~**4X**.\r\n\r\nAn example that contains 25 non-PEP 634 usages and 25 PEP 634 usages of `match/case`: [example_2.py](https://gist.github.com/isidentical/0bfc74c21d351a87ae933087fd36304d)\r\n```\r\n-t py310 (main):: Mean +- std dev: 1.22 sec +- 0.03 sec\r\n-t py310 (this branch):: Mean +- std dev: 93.0 ms +- 6.8 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd another example is parsing the [`Lib/test/test_patma.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/e6497fe698f6e87344501a68ffdea106eafcb257/Lib/test/test_patma.py), which has all of the pattern matching statement variations known to the humans (I've only run `lib2to3_parse()` once since it takes so much time on the `main`, so assume this is `+/- 20 seconds`):\r\n```\r\nmain: 2 minutes, 33 seconds\r\nthis branch: 2.499 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\nObviously, a change like this, at the core of the parser, should be verified though I do not have many examples of pattern matching myself. My script to parse every variation of pattern matching statements (originating through `Lib/test/test_patma.py`) says it can parse all of the examples. \r\n\r\nI've also taken the diff of the following command and compared it, which yielded no difference in formatting between main/this branch (speed-wise it is like 50X faster):\r\n```console\r\n$ black -tpy310 --fast --diff ~/projects/cpython/Lib/test/test_patma.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther than that, I've also tried formatting the whole stdlib (including tests) and there is also no relevant changes. If you have other ideas to verify this, that would be wonderful.\r\n ",

The other one is a workflow_dispatch, i.e. basically you can run diff-shades against arbitrary revisions/branches/tags (including the latest PyPI release and a PR!).\r\n\r\n![diff-shades-dispatch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63936253/147293901-cc67f42f-d2ae-4b6e-968b-90e4395236a4.png)\r\n\r\nI plan on adding more documentation about this integration eventually but I want to get this landed sooner than later right now.\r\n\r\nI really really hope this doesn't break in production but I guess there's only one way to tell :)\r\n\r\nResolves GH-1390.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary? -> as cool as this is, it's still development only\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary? -> well I tested this manually a bunch\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n\r\n### Review notes\r\n\r\nThis is 500+ lines of code and documentation, I don't expect you to review each line.

To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n## What?\r\n\r\nI've added support for formatting Python Markdown code blocks. \r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThese changes allow the user to format markdown files and strings. In one instance of my own (https://github.com/sunset-developer/sanic-security), I have a plethora of Python examples in my project's README.md. However, none of these examples are formatted with Black and doing so would entail me going through the pain staking process of replacing each code block example. With these changes, black can be used to automatically format all markdown code blocks instantly, and conveniently. \r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nWhen Black is ran, the user would add the --docs flag in order to format any markdown files. Once ran, each code block in the Markdown is retrieved via regex and added to a list. Then, each one of these code blocks is formatted. Once each code block is formatted, the original non-formatted code block is replaced by the formatted code block and the new formatted Markdown string is returned. If no changes are made or the Markdown is empty, a `NothingChanged` error is thrown.\r\n\r\n## Testing?\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been written to make sure all desired functionality works as intended. Test data has also been created to be used as reference. \r\n\r\nFunctionality tested:\r\n\r\n* Empty Markdown raises `NothingChanged` error.\r\n* Markdown without Python code blocks raises `NothingChanges` error.\r\n* Markdown code block formatting cross-referenced with already formatted Markdown code blocks.\r\n* `--docs` flag.\r\n* Formatting Markdown strings and files.\r\n\r\nI am very open to feedback and any changes you would like me to make. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nIf you like these changes, I plan on adding support for .rst  and .tex files as well.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

from <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">myst-parser's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>0.16.0 - 2021-12-06</h2>\n<p>This release contains a number of exciting improvements:</p>\n<h3>Upgrade of Markdown parser</h3>\n<p><code>markdown-it-py</code> has been upgraded to <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py/releases/tag/v2.0.0\">v2.0.0</a>.\nThis upgrade brings full compliance with the <a href=\"https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/\">CommonMark v0.30 specification</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <code>mdit-py-plugins</code> has been upgraded to <a href=\"https://github.com/executablebooks/mdit-py-plugins/releases/tag/v0.3.0\">v0.3.0</a>.\nThis improves the parsing of the MyST target syntax, to allow for spaces and additional special characters in the target name,\nfor example this is now valid:</p>\n<pre lang=\"md\"><code>(a bc   |@&lt;&gt;*./_-+:)=\n<h1>Header</h1>\n<p></code></pre></p>\n<p>Also MyST role syntax now supports unlimited length in the role name and new lines in the content.\nFor example, this is now valid:</p>\n<pre lang=\"md\"><code>{abc}`xy\nnew line`\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Improvements for Docutils-only use</h3>\n<p>MyST now allows for Docutils-only use (outside of Sphinx), that allows for MyST configuration options to be set via the <code>docutils.conf</code> file, or on the command line.</p>\n<p>On installing MyST-Parser, the following CLI-commands are made available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>myst-docutils-html</code>: converts MyST to HTML</li>\n<li><code>myst-docutils-html5</code>: converts MyST to HTML5</li>\n<li><code>myst-docutils-latex</code>: converts

A proposal for this issue was made in the  fmtskip_nospace branch which aims to hard code logic handling this bug within the make_comment function of comments.py. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This does NOT handle arbitrary spacing for the # fmt: skip which should be handled in another pull request. \r\n\r\nIssues with current pull request: Building on different platforms fails due to the unit test fmtskip7.py failing when running pre-config.

Module specific configuration! and a bit of restructuring of code in the `black/__init__.py` file. Mainly shifting all the \"reformatting\" logic to a separate function to increase the readability of code in the click CLI  function. You can go through the code in the commit, code should be self explanatory, though I still need to update the documentation of the code and this feature.\r\n\r\nI haven't aimed at bringing new tests in this commit, if required, I could do that and this rather fixes the tests to work according to the change I have done in this commit.\r\n\r\nSummarising the changes:\r\n- Now, you can support file/module specific configuration in the pyproject.toml config under the section of `[tools.black-module]`. I have added a separate \"key\" for the modules as according to the current code when the module name could clash with a config argument. For example `[tools.black.src]` would clash with `SRC`.\r\n\r\n- Module specific configuration can only some arguments which are listed under a global constant in `config.py` and should agree with the type hint present on them in the class variables, the logic for this functionality can be seen in `cast_typehint` function of `config.py`. At some places I have ignored MYPY errors so as I couldn't change the configuration since they were being used for typing.\r\n\r\n- Added a new class for storing all the parameters, the order of the arguments is as follows:\r\n  * Read global pyproject.toml/specified config config.\r\n  * Read module specific config, which would take the none specified arguments from the global configuration.\r\n  * If value specified through click options/arguments it would be overwritten, this won't happen if the default value of the option is taken.\r\n  * Tada!\r\n\r\nCloses #1370\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n- [ ] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [ ] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n",

Anyway it would've gotten too big to review effectively\r\nif I did continue on this PR.\r\n\r\nCommit history before squash merge:\r\n\r\n* Drop parameterized dep and refactor format tests\r\n\r\nSince the test suite is already using pytest-only features we can drop\r\nthe parameterized test dependency in favour of pytest's own offering.\r\n\r\nI also added an utility function called assert_format that makes it\r\neven easier to verify Black formats some code correctly. We already\r\nhave great tooling if the case is very simple in test_format.py but\r\nany sort of complication makes it hard to use. Also if you're writing\r\na non-standard test case, you have to be careful to include all of\r\nthe steps so issues don't go undetected. assert_format aims to\r\n1) improve consistency, 2) avoid wasted CPU cycles, and 3) avoid\r\nlogical errors that hide issues.\r\n\r\nFinally, quite a few tests were either moved and/or simplified with\r\nthe new setup.\r\n\r\n* Move file collection tests\r\n* Add assert_collected_sources helper function\r\n\r\nTesting source collection involves a lot of repetitive boilerplate,\r\nsomething that black.files.get_sources's signature does not help with.\r\nSo to cut down on boilerplate like `report=black.Report()` I added\r\na convenience function to tests/test_black.py which wraps\r\nblack.get_sources. Its signature is designed to be much more lax to\r\nmake it much easier to use. Somehow this leads to cutting 100 lines!\r\n\r\nAlso IMO the test cases are much easier to read since it's more\r\ndeclarative than really procedural now.\r\n\r\n* Run isort on some test files\r\n* Move cache tests\r\n* Use pytest-style asserts & add parametrization\r\n* Drop now unnecessary test dependencies\r\n\r\n*pytest-cases might be interesting for further refactoring but I\r\nhaven't been able to wrap my head around it for the time being. We\r\ncan always revisit anyway."

If this work doesn't find its way to PyPI eventually, I'll be disappointed :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nI wrote an entire report which can be read here: https://gist.github.com/ichard26/b996ccf410422b44fcd80fb158e05b0d, but the TL;DR is:\r\n\r\n- Formatting _with_ safety checks: **1.93x faster**\r\n- Formatting _without_ safety checks: **2.11x faster**\r\n- Blib2to3 parsing: 1.81x faster\r\n- Import (import black): **1.16x faster**\r\n\r\nWindows numbers are to come later. Unfortunately I probably won't be able to get MacOS numbers (I own no MacOS running machine), but I'll see what I can do.\r\n\r\n### Stability\r\n\r\nI've been running the test suite during the wheel build and as of latest of this branch it's all green. Though it should be noted that the arm64 and the arm portion of the universial2 wheels are completely untested since we don't have access to any M1 CI resources :(\r\n\r\nLocally I've ran [diff-shades](https://github.com/ichard26/black-mypyc-wheels/blob/main/diff_shades.py) (Jelle, it's basically mypy-primer but for black) against the CPython 3.8 manylinux wheel and no difference between interpreted and compiled Black was found (across the same project suite used by black-primer + blackbench :wink:). I plan to also test Windows with diff-shades in the following days. I'll also get Cooper to test Intel MacOS + M1 MacOS for me, but I need to come up with better instructions before that.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, please don't expect this to be fully tested. I plan to ask the wider community to test the experimental compiled wheels (and push any additional fixes) after this PR is merged. \r\n\r\n### Review notes\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a lot of things including QOL improvements, optimizations, compatibility changes, hacks, etc. While the diff isn't that painful, following the commit history should give you some context on why certain changes were made.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that I plan to handle the merge of this PR myself since this project involves a lot of moving parts and I'd like to maintain control for the time being. Thanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated issue: GH-366  \r\nRelated repo: https://github.com/ichard26/black-mypyc-wheels\r\n\r\nAnd if you're some passerby who really wants to try the experimental wheels, checkout the workflows here: https://github.com/ichard26/black-mypyc-wheels/actions.

      "Remove `language_version` for pre-commit (#2430)\n\n* Remove `language_version` for pre-commit\r\n\r\nAt my company, we set the Python version in `default_language_version`\r\nin each repo's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,\r\nso that all hooks are running with the same Python version.\r\n\r\nHowever, this currently doesn't work for black,\r\nas the `language_version` specified here\r\nin the upstream `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` takes precedence.\r\nCurrently, this requires us to manually set `language_version`\r\nspecifically for black,\r\nduplicating the value from `default_language_version`.\r\nThe failure mode otherwise is subtle -\r\nblack works most of the time,\r\nbut try to add a walrus operator and it suddenly breaks!\r\n\r\nGiven that black's `setup.py` already has `python_requires>=3.6.2`,\r\nspecifying that `python3` must be used here isn't needed\r\nas folks inadvertently using Python 2 will get hook-install-time failures anyways.\r\nRemove the `language_version` from these upstream hook configs\r\nso that users of black are able to use `default_language_version`\r\nand have it apply to all their hooks, black included.\r\n\r\nExample `.pre-commit-config.yaml` before:\r\n```\r\ndefault_language_version:\r\n  python: python3.8\r\nrepos:\r\n-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black\r\n    rev: 21.7b0\r\n    hooks:\r\n    -   id: black\r\n        language_version: python3.8\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\ndefault_language_version:\r\n  python: python3.8\r\nrepos:\r\n-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black\r\n    rev: 21.7b0\r\n    hooks:\r\n    -   id: black\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Add changelog entry"

His original commit is till at the beginning of the branch, which I then modified (Thank you for the initial push!)\r\n\r\nA number of non-obvious details and questions:\r\n- As suggested by Richard in the linked issue, I removed the error messages (and a test) for Python 2 parsing\r\n- Previously versions 3.6 and 3.7 were parsed twice, first by the builtin `ast` and then by `typed_ast`. On [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/846434317021741086/850083982459535400) we determined this was an accident so I removed it.\r\n- The parsing was refactored a bit for clearer flow. It's now two functions: one for parsing a single version, and the wrapping function for constructing a list of versions to parse and then doing it. Probably easier to view the source than the diff on that one.\r\n- Mypy linting fails, even though none of the type signatures were changed. Should we ignore it or is there some trickery that could be done to make Mypy recognise the types?\r\n\r\nEverything's in separate commits for an easier review. I'll leave this as a draft at least until the Mypy issue has been resolved.",

      "Reorganize docs v2 (GH-2174)\n\nI know I know, this is the second reorganization of the docs. I'm not\r\nsaying the first one was bad or anything... but.. actually wait nah,\r\n*it was bad*.\r\n\r\nAnyway, welcome to probably my biggest commit. The main thing with this\r\nreorganization was to introduce nesting to the documentation! Having\r\nall of the docs be part of the main TOC was becoming too much. There\r\nwasn't much room to expand either. Finally, the old setup required\r\na documentation generation step which was just annoying.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this reorganization was to:\r\n\r\n1. Significantly restructure the docs to be discoverable and\r\n   understandable\r\n\r\n2. Add room for further docs (like guides or contributing docs)\r\n\r\n3. Get rid of the doc generation step (it was slow and frustrating)\r\n\r\n4. Unblock other improvements and also just make contributing to the\r\n   docs easier\r\n\r\nAnother important change with this is that we are no longer using GitHub\r\nas a documentation host. While GitHub does support Markdown based docs\r\nactually pretty well, the lack of any features outside of GitHub Flavoured\r\nMarkdown is quite limiting. ReadTheDocs is just much better suited for\r\ndocumentation. You can use reST, MyST, CommonMark, and all of their\r\ngreat features like toctrees and admonitions.\r\n\r\nRelated to this change, we're adopting MyST as our flavour of Markdown.\r\nMyST introduces neat syntax extensions to Markdown that pretty much\r\ngives us the best of both worlds. The ease of use and simplicity of MD\r\nand the flexibility and expressiveness of reST. Also recommonmark is\r\ndeprecated now. This switch was possible now we don't use GH as a docs\r\nhost. MyST docs have to be built to really be usable / pretty, so the MD\r\ndocs are going to look pretty bad on GH, but that's fine now!\r\n\r\nAnother thing that should be noted is that the README has been stripped\r\nof most content since it was confusing. Users would read the README and\r\nthen think some feature or bug was fixed already and is available in a\r\nrelease when in reality, they weren't. They were reading effectively\r\nthe latest docs without knowing.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1759\r\n\r\nFYI: CommonMark is a rationalized version of Markdown syntax\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nCommit history before merge:\r\n\r\n* Switch to MyST-Parser + doc config cleanup\r\n\r\n  recommonmark is being deprecated in favour of MyST-Parser. This change\r\n  is welcomed, especially since MyST-Parser has syntax extensions for the\r\n  Commonmark standard. Effectively we get to use a language that's powerful\r\n  and expressive like ReST, but get the simplicity of Markdown.\r\n\r\n  The rest of this effort will be using some MyST features.\r\n\r\n  This reorganization efforts aims to remove as much duplication as possible.\r\n  The regeneration step once needed is gone, significantly simplifing our\r\n  Sphinx documentation configuration.\r\n\r\n* Tell pipenv we replaced recommonmark for MyST-Parser\r\n\r\n  Also update `docs/requirements.txt`\r\n\r\n* Delete all auto generated content\r\n* Switch prettier for mdformat (plus a few plugins)\r\n\r\n  **FYI: THIS WAS EFFECTIVELY REVERTED, SEE THIRD TO LAST COMMIT**\r\n\r\n  prettier doesn't support MyST's syntax extensions which are going to be\r\n  used in this reorganization effort so we have to switch formatter.\r\n\r\n  Unfortanately mdformat's style is different from prettier's so time to\r\n  reformat the whole repo too.\r\n\r\n  We're excluding .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE because I have no idea whether\r\n  its changes are safe, so let's play it safe.\r\n\r\n* Fix the heading levels in CHANGES.md + a link\r\n\r\n  MyST-Parser / sphinx's linkcheck complains otherwise.\r\n\r\n* Move reference docs into a docs/contributing dir\r\n\r\n  They're for contributors of Black anyway. Also added a note in the\r\n  summary document warning about the lack of attention the reference has\r\n  been dealing with.\r\n\r\n* Rewrite and setup the new landing page + main TOC\r\n\r\n  - add some more detail about Black's beta status\r\n  - add licensing info\r\n  - add external links in the main TOC for GitHub, PyPI, and IRC\r\n  - prepare main TOC for new structure\r\n\r\n* Break out AUTHORS into its own file\r\n\r\n  Not only was the AUTHORS list quite long, this makes it easy to include\r\n  it in the Sphinx docs with just a simple symlink.\r\n\r\n* Add license to docs via a simple include\r\n\r\n  Yes the document is orphaned but it is linked to in the landing page\r\n  (docs/index.rst).\r\n\r\n* Add \"The Black Code Style\" section\r\n\r\n  This mostly was a restructuring commit, there has been a few updates but\r\n  not many. The main goal was to split \"current style\" and \"planned\r\n  changes to the style that haven't happened yet\" to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n* Add \"Getting Started\" page\r\n\r\n  This is basically a quick start + even more. This commit is certainly\r\n  one of most creatively involved in this effort.\r\n\r\n* Add \"Usage and Configuration\" section\r\n\r\n  This commit was as much restructuring as new content. Instead of being\r\n  in one giant file, usage and configuration documentation can expand\r\n  without bloating a single file.\r\n\r\n* Add \"Integrations\" section\r\n\r\nJust a restructuring commit ...\r\n\r\n* Add \"Guides\" section\r\n\r\n  This is a promising area of documentation that could easily grow in the\r\n  future, let's prepare for that!\r\n\r\n* Add \"Contributing\" section\r\n\r\n  This is also another area that I expect to see significant growth in.\r\n  Contributors to Black could definitely do with some more specific docs\r\n  that clears up certain parts of our slightly confusing project (it's\r\n  only confusing because we're getting big and old!).\r\n\r\n* Rewrite CONTRIBUTING.md to just point to RTD\r\n* Rewrite README.md to delegate most info to RTD\r\n* Address feedback + a lot of corrections and edits\r\n\r\n  I know I said I wanted to do these after landing this but given there's\r\n  going to be no time between this being merged and a release getting\r\n  pushed, I want these changes to make it in.\r\n\r\n  - drop the number flag for mdformat - to reduce diffs, see also:\r\n    https://mdformat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/style.html#ordered-lists\r\n  - the GH issue templates should be safe by mdformat, so get rid of the\r\n    exclude\r\n  - clarify our configuration position - i.e. stop claiming we don't have\r\n    many options, instead say we want as little formatting knobs as\r\n    possible\r\n  - lots and lots of punctuation, spelling, and grammar corrections (thanks\r\n    Jelle!)\r\n  - use RTD as the source for the CHANGELOG too\r\n  - visual style cleanups\r\n  - add docs about our .gitignore behaviour\r\n  - expand GHA Action docs\r\n  - clarify we want the PR number in the CHANGELOG entry\r\n  - claify Black's behaviour for with statements post Python 3.9\r\n  - italicize a bunch of \"Black\"s\r\n\r\n  Thank you goes to Jelle, Taneli (hukkinj1 on GH), Felix\r\n  (felix-hilden on GH), and Wouter (wbolster on GH) for the feedback!\r\n\r\n* Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into reorganize-docs-v2\r\n\r\n  merge conflicts suck, although these ones weren't too bad.\r\n\r\n* Add changelog entry + fix merge conflict resolution error\r\n\r\n  I consider this important enough to be worthy of a changelog entry :)\r\n\r\n* Merge branch 'master' into reorganize-docs-v2\r\n\r\n  Co-authored-by: Łukasz Langa <lukasz@langa.pl>\r\n\r\n* Actually let's continue using prettier\r\n\r\n  Prettier works fine for all of the default MyST syntax so let's not\r\n  rock the boat as much. Dropping the mdformat commit was merge-conflict\r\n  filled so here's additional commit instead.\r\n\r\n* Address Cooper's, Taneli's, and Jelle's feedback\r\n\r\n  Lots of wording improvements by Cooper. Taneli suggested to disable the\r\n  enabled by default MyST syntax not supported by Prettier and I agreed.\r\n  And Jelle found one more spelling error!\r\n\r\n* More minor fixes"

Reading the changelog I don't think it has, but I haven't been around.\r\n- Doc placement: I think the \"Strings\" section is appropriate for both, unless another section for indentation is created. I appended the text to the section by default, and because \"experimental\" hints that maybe it shouldn't be the first thing to be introduced to the reader. I'm not sure about the docstring paragraph though. It is quite short, so maybe it ought to be merged with some other paragraph.\r\n\r\nI don't think any of the checks apply, and `skip news` could also be added. Pre-commit did line up the text though.\r\n\r\nHappy to make any changes you suggest!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, while running the install stuff, there was some sort of process pool termination when formatting the repository.

So far they've found around 25,000 (!!) bugs in hundreds of open source projects.\r\n\r\nSince I've recently [been asked](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/4121) to [show how to use Hypothesis on OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/4975), and [Black is considered a critical project](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score#public-data), I thought it would make sense to integrate Black with OSS-Fuzz directly.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, OSS-Fuzz also provides a CI action to run fuzzing briefly on each PR (anywhere from six minutes up to the Actions timeout at six hours!) - this is *almost* a duplicate of the existing fuzz job, but integrates with the constant fuzzing so it can replay all known examples first off.  If you think that sounds a lot like vanilla Hypothesis, no coincidence - we've stolen a lot of features from cutting-edge fuzzing workflows, when we didn't independently invent them first!  (and our shrinking is still way better 😤)\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIf interested: merge this, and comment on https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/4977 to confirm that Black maintainers approve.

Originally, the plugin read the string-normalization option,\r\nwhich does not exist in help (--help) and it's not respected by black\r\non command line.\r\n\r\nCommit history before merge:\r\n\r\n* fix string normalization option in vim plugin\r\n* fix string normalization option in vim plugin\r\n* Finish and fix patch (thanks Matt Wozniski!)\r\n\r\nFYI: this is totally the work and the comments below of Matt (AKA godlygeek)\r\n\r\nThis fixes two entirely different problems related to how pyproject.toml\r\nfiles are handled by the vim plugin.\r\n\r\n=== Problem #1 ===\r\n\r\nThe plugin fails to properly read boolean values from pyproject.toml.\r\nFor instance, if you create this pyproject.toml:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[tool.black]\r\nquiet = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe Black CLI is happy with it and runs without any messages, but the\r\n:Black command provided by this plugin fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 102, in Black\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 150, in get_configs\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 150, in <dictcomp>\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/distutils/util.py\", line 311, in strtobool\r\n    val = val.lower()\r\nAttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'lower'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's because the value returned by the toml.load() is already a\r\nbool, but the vim plugin incorrectly tries to convert it from a str to a bool.\r\n\r\nThe value returned by toml_config.get() was always being passed to\r\nflag.cast(), which is a function that either converts a string to an\r\nint or a string to a bool, depending on the flag. vim.eval()\r\nreturns integers and strings all as str, which is why we need the cast,\r\nbut that's the wrong thing to do for values that came from toml.load().\r\nWe should be applying the cast only to the return from vim.eval()\r\n(since we know it always gives us a string), rather than casting the\r\nvalue that toml.load() found - which is already the right type.\r\n\r\n=== Problem #2 ===\r\n\r\nThe vim plugin fails to take the value for skip_string_normalization\r\nfrom pyproject.toml. That's because it looks for a string_normalization\r\nkey instead of a skip_string_normalization key, thanks to this line\r\nsaying the name of the flag is string_normalization:\r\n\r\nblack/autoload/black.vim (line 25 in 05b54b8)\r\n```\r\n Flag(name=\"string_normalization\", cast=strtobool),\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this dictcomp looking up each flag's name in the config dict:\r\n\r\nblack/autoload/black.vim (lines 148 to 151 in 05b54b8)\r\n```\r\n return {\r\n   flag.var_name: flag.cast(toml_config.get(flag.name, vim.eval(flag.vim_rc_name)))\r\n   for flag in FLAGS\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the second issue, I think I'd do a slightly different patch. I'd\r\nkeep the change to invert this flag's meaning and change its name that\r\nthis PR proposes, but I'd also change the handling of the\r\ng:black_skip_string_normalization and g:black_string_normalization\r\nvariables to make it clear that g:black_skip_string_normalization is\r\nthe expected name, and g:black_string_normalization is only checked\r\nwhen the expected name is unset, for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nMy proposed behavior is to check if g:black_skip_string_normalization\r\nis defined and to define it if not, using the inverse of\r\ng:black_string_normalization if that is set, and otherwise to the\r\ndefault of 0. The Python code in autoload/black.vim runs later, and\r\nwill use the value of g:black_skip_string_normalization (and ignore\r\ng:black_string_normalization; it will only be used to set\r\ng:black_skip_string_normalization if it wasn't already set).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Matt Wozniski <mwozniski@bloomberg.net>\r\n\r\n* Fix plugin/black.vim (need to up my vim game)\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Matt Wozniski <godlygeek@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Richard Si <63936253+ichard26@users.noreply.github.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Matt Wozniski <mwozniski@bloomberg.net>\r\nCo-authored-by: Matt Wozniski <godlygeek@gmail.com>"

Please tell me if i did something wrong according to your ordinary rules.\n\nThe issue, #1692, argues whether we/you should \"simply\" do this, as it might impact source code of a large set of users, however you can either merge it if you like it or wait if not. :) Please write me if I can do anything in that regard.\n\nI created two seperate commits:\n- Made hex lower case\n- Refactored numeric formatting section\n\nThis was done to seperate the two focus points, the first one solves the issue, whereas the second adds a bit of refactoring to that part of the code. Whether my version has a higher code quality or not, is definitely subjective, so please ignore it and cherry-pick if you dislike it :) \n\nI am looking forward to contributing to black, long time user, and all that, so I hope you like it. I'll try to do something once in a while - Am doing this as part of hacktoberfest though, so if you can either label it `hacktoberfest-accepted` or merge it before the end of the month, that will be great ;) I feel super cheap writing that, but i am trying to pimp my bike with a yearly sticker from hacktoberfest, and this month is running a bit short.

In that way we can make sure that the contributors of black test in the same environment as the CI process.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I propose moving to use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as the testing infrastructure because it could make our tests much clearer. Consider the following tests from *test_black.py*:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    ...\r\n    @patch(\"black.dump_to_file\", dump_to_stderr)\r\n    def test_function(self) -> None:\r\n        source, expected = read_data(\"function\")\r\n        actual = fs(source)\r\n        self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)\r\n        black.assert_equivalent(source, actual)\r\n        black.assert_stable(source, actual, DEFAULT_MODE)\r\n\r\n    @patch(\"black.dump_to_file\", dump_to_stderr)\r\n    def test_function2(self) -> None:\r\n        source, expected = read_data(\"function2\")\r\n        actual = fs(source)\r\n        self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)\r\n        black.assert_equivalent(source, actual)\r\n        black.assert_stable(source, actual, DEFAULT_MODE)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose are practically the same test. Why do we need to write it twice? with *pytest* we could simply write:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    ...\r\n    @patch(\"black.dump_to_file\", dump_to_stderr)\r\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\"file_name\", [\"function\", \"function2\"])\r\n    def test_function(self, file_name) -> None:\r\n        source, expected = read_data(file_name)\r\n        actual = fs(source)\r\n        self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)\r\n        black.assert_equivalent(source, actual)\r\n        black.assert_stable(source, actual, DEFAULT_MODE)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think both changes will be beneficial for *Black*.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

      "Automatically build and upload binaries on release (#1743)\n\nThis commit adds a new GitHub Actions workflow that builds self-contained\r\nbinaries / executables and uploads them as release assets to the triggering\r\nrelease. Publishing a release, drafting one doesn't count, will trigger this\r\nworkflow.\r\n\r\nI personally used GitHub Actions only because it's the CI/CD platform(?)\r\nI am familiar with. Only Windows and Linux binaries are supported since\r\nI don't have any systems running Mac OS.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, I had originally planned to use the manylinux2010 docker image\r\nthe PyPA provides for highly compatible wheel building, but unfortunately\r\nit wasn't feasible due to GitHub Actions and PyInstaller incompatibilities.\r\nAs a stopgap the oldest versions of Linux and Windows are used although\r\nWindows Server 2019 isn't that old nor is Ubuntu 16.04! I guess someone\r\n(maybe me) could work out something else if compatibility is big problem.\r\n\r\nA few things you should know about the workflow:\r\n - You don't need to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret as it is automatically\r\n   provided by GitHub.\r\n - matrix.pathsep is used because PyInstaller configuration's format is OS\r\n   dependent for some reason ...\r\n\r\nAlso it's worth mentioning that Black once had Travis CI and AppVeyor\r\nconfiguration that did the same thing as this commit. They were committed\r\nin mid 2018 and worked (somewhat) well. Eventually we stopped using AppVeyor\r\nand the refactor to packages broke the Travis CI config. This commit\r\nreplaces the still existing and broken Travis CI config wholesale.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Anders Fredrik Kiær <31612826+anders-kiaer@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n - Anders told me that I could get the release asset upload URL directly\r\n   from the github.event.release payload.

      "Fix empty line handling when formatting typing stubs (#1646)\n\nBlack used to erroneously remove all empty lines between non-function\r\ncode and decorators when formatting typing stubs. Now a single empty\r\nline is enforced.\r\n\r\nI chose for putting empty lines around decorated classes that have empty\r\nbodies since removing empty lines around such classes would cause a\r\nformatting issue that seems to be impossible to fix.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A: ...\r\n@some_decorator\r\nclass B: ...\r\nclass C: ...\r\nclass D: ...\r\n\r\n@some_other_decorator\r\ndef foo(): -> None: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is easy to enforce no empty lines between class A, B, and C.\r\nJust return 0, 0 for a line that is a decorator and precedes an stub\r\nclass. Fortunately before this commit, empty lines after that class\r\nwould be removed already.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at the empty line between class D and function foo. In\r\nthis case, there should be an empty line there since it's class code next\r\nto function code. The problem is that when deciding to add X empty lines\r\nbefore a decorator, you can't tell whether it's before a class or a\r\nfunction. If the decorator is before a function, then an empty line\r\nis needed, while no empty lines are needed when the decorator is\r\nbefore a class.\r\n\r\nSo even though I personally prefer no empty lines around decorated\r\nclasses, I had to go the other way surrounding decorated classes with\r\nempty lines.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jelle Zijlstra <jelle.zijlstra@gmail.com>"

The cache directory is created once Black has formatted\r\nsomething and writeback was True or --check was True and CHANGED was\r\nNO. This is mostly a problem when using Black as a library since you\r\nhave to handle the cache creating, writing, and reading yourself\r\n(including the directory tree).\r\n\r\nWhile failing to write the pickled grammar tables isn't big problem\r\n(Black and blib2to3 can still work), lots of GitHub issues have been\r\ncreated due the error that appears.\r\n\r\nThis change *should hopefully* make it clearer that in fact, it isn't\r\nsomething to be worried about (unless performance is your goal).\r\nAlthough honestly the root issue is that users using Black as a library\r\nshould have access to good documentation on managing Black's cache and\r\nby extension, blib2to3's cache. Once we have a documented public API\r\nthough :)\r\n\r\n*This might not be a issue down the road if Black switches parsers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI chose to explicitly skip writing the pickled grammar tables since [JelleZijlstra preferred](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/1224#issuecomment-571898654):\r\n> I'd generally prefer if we minimize the side effects of just importing Black, because people may end up importing Black in applications that don't necessarily end up needing the cache directory. \r\n\r\nwhile commenting on the other PR that would fix this issue (https://github.com/psf/black/pull/1224).

The only sad part of this change is that for users of Firefox, they will have to see an ugly scrollbar since Firefox disabled hiding scrollbar by default~~ (please see #1457)\r\n- Completely reworked the logic in `docs/conf.py`.\r\n  - Added a `DocSection` dataclass which represents sections of documentation\r\n    - The `name` attribute is the section's name.\r\n    - The `src` attribute is where to get the section's contents.\r\n    - The `processors` attribute is processors to call on the section's contents before writing them back. This extensibility feature can be used to implement a link autoreplacer for example :)\r\n    - The `out_filename` attribute is the filename to be used when writing the section. Only the merged `the_black_code_style_and_pragmatism` section uses this feature.\r\n    - The `src_range` attribute is well... a `src_range` object\r\n    - The `get_out_filename` method returns the `out_filename` attribute if set. If not, then it returns the section's name + `.md`\r\n  - Added a `SrcRange` dataclass which represents a line range of the section's contents\r\n  - Added a `get_contents` function which takes a `DocSection` and returns the contents of that section\r\n  - Moved the header fixing code from the now deleted `generate_sections_from_readme` function into a processor which is ran for all sections generated from `README.md`.\r\n  - Completely redone the `generate_sections_from_readme` function and renamed it to `get_sections_from_readme`. It now spits out a list of `DocSection` objects.\r\n  - Created a new function called `process_sections` which takes `custom_sections` and `readme_sections` and processes them. The workflow of how it works is listed below:\r\n    - Extend `custom_sections` with `readme_sections`\r\n    - While iterating through each `DocSection` from the now extended `custom_sections`:\r\n      - Check if a section which has the same name has been processed already. If so, then skip processing that section. This is how `custom_sections` overrides the default sections from `readme_sections`.\r\n      - Get the target_path via `target_path: Path = CURRENT_DIR / section.get_out_filename()`\r\n      - Get the section's contents using `get_contents(section)`\r\n      - Run all processors defined from `section.processors` over the section's contents\r\n      - Write the section's contents to `target_path`\r\n      - Append the section's name to `processed_sections` so duplicates can be detected and skipped\r\n- Using the new logic, I defined a `custom_sections` list which contains `DocSection` objects. This defines the custom / non-readme-based sections:\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>custom_sections</summary>\r\n\r\n```py3\r\ncustom_sections = [\r\n    DocSection(\"the_black_code_style\", CURRENT_DIR / \"the_black_code_style.md\",),\r\n    DocSection(\"pragmatism\", CURRENT_DIR / \"the_black_code_style.md\",),\r\n    DocSection(\"editor_integration\", CURRENT_DIR / \"editor_integration.md\"),\r\n    DocSection(\"blackd\", CURRENT_DIR / \"blackd.md\"),\r\n    DocSection(\"black_primer\", CURRENT_DIR / \"black_primer.md\"),\r\n    DocSection(\"contributing_to_black\", CURRENT_DIR / \"..\" / \"CONTRIBUTING.md\"),\r\n    DocSection(\"change_log\", CURRENT_DIR / \"..\" / \"CHANGES.md\"),\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>",

      "Refactor docs / Maintenance of docs (#1456)\n\n* Split code style and components documentation\r\n\r\nSplits 'the_black_code_style', 'pragmatism', 'blackd',and 'black_primer'\r\ninto their own files. The exception being 'the_black_code_style' and\r\n'pragmatism'. They have been merged into one 'the_black_code_style_and_pragmatism'\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nThese changes are being made because the README is becoming very long. And\r\na README isn't great if it dissuades its reader because of its length.\r\n\r\n* Update the doc generation logic and configuration\r\n\r\nWith the moving of several sections in the README and the renaming of a\r\nfew files, 'conf.py' needs to be able to support custom sections.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces DocSection which can be used to specify custom\r\nsections of documentation. The information stored in DocSection will be\r\nused by the process_sections function to read, process, and write the section\r\nto CURRENT_DIR.\r\n\r\nA large change has been made to the how the docs are prepared to be built.\r\nInstead of just generating the files needed by reading the README, this\r\nhas a full chain of operations so custom sections are supported. First,\r\nit reads the README and spits out a list of DocSection objects representing\r\nthe sections to be generated by process_sections. This is done since most\r\nof the docs still live in README. Then along with the defined custom_sections\r\n, the process_sections will be begin to process the DocSection objects.\r\nIt reads the information it needs to generate the section. Then fetches\r\nthe section's contents, calls processors required by the section to process\r\nthe section's contents, and finally writes the section to CURRENT_DIR.\r\n\r\nThis large change is so processing of the documentation can be done just\r\nfor the versions hosted on ReadTheDocs.org. An example processor using this\r\nfeature is a 'replace_links' processor. It will replace documentation\r\nlinks that point to the docs hosted on GitHub with links that point to the\r\nversion hosted on ReadTheDocs.org. (I won't be coding that ATM)\r\n\r\nThis also means that files will be overwritten or created once the docs\r\nhave been built. It is annoying, since you have to 'git reset --hard'\r\nand 'git clean -f -d' after each build, but there's nothing better. The old\r\nsystem had the same side effects, so yeah :(\r\n\r\n* Update filenames and delete unnecessary files\r\n\r\nUpdate the filenames since 'the_black_code_style' and 'pragmatism' were\r\nmerged and 'contributing' was deleted in favor of 'contributing_to_black'.\r\n\r\nAll symlinks were deleted since their home (_build/generated) is no longer\r\nused.\r\n\r\n* Fix broken links and a few redirections\r\n\r\n* Merge master into refactor_docs (manually done)\r\n\r\n* Add my and most of @hugovk suggestions\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Hugo van Kemenade <hugovk@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n* Add logging and improve configurability\r\n\r\nJust some cleaning up up of the DocSection dataclass and added logging\r\nsupport so you know what's going on.\r\n\r\n* Rename a section and please the grammar gods of Black\r\n\r\nThanks @hugovk for the suggestion!\r\n\r\n* Fix Markdown comments\r\n\r\n* Add myself as an author :P\r\n\r\nSeems like the right time.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Hugo van Kemenade <hugovk@users.noreply.github.com>"

Since git version 2.23,\r\ngit natively supports ignoring revisions in blame with the --ignore-rev\r\nand --ignore-revs-file options.\r\n\r\nThis isn't documented in the Black documentation. It should be as it would\r\nput old projects wanting to migrate to Black at ease since blame won't\r\nbe ruined.\r\n\r\n* Add links so people can +1 on --ignore-revs-file support\r\n\r\n* Fix wording\r\n\r\n'Counterargument' was the wrong word since it means an objection to an objection.

This makes the Black Vim plugin one-time setup (i.e. virtualenv creation and Black Python package installation) fail at the ensurepip stage (because `vim -Im ensurepip ...` doesn't make any sense).\r\n\r\nA possible workaround is to just override the `sys._base_executable` attribute, especially since the Black plugin already overrides `sys.executable` (possibly for similar reasons?) anyway. This is what the present patch does.\r\n\r\nMore generally though, is this intended behavior or a bug in recent versions of Python and/or Vim? I'm leaning towards a bug in Vim, since running `:python3 import sys; print(sys._base_executable)` in Neovim correctly prints a Python path, even with Python 3.8.

This is still doable, but will take more effort. Personally I don't much see the need for it - using a boolean is sufficient in my opinion.

Fallback is `py34`, `py35`, `py36`, `py37`, and system version\r\n- Handle `IndexError` in `read_cache` - appears only in `PyPy`\r\n\r\n### CI changes\r\n- Updated CI scripts to install `typed_ast` extra\r\n- Added `pypy3` to Travis CI\r\n- Added `py38` with no `typed_ast` to Travis CI\r\n\r\n### Unit tests changes\r\n\r\n- Added explicit `target_versions` to some test cases\r\n- Removed `PY36_VERSIONS` usage (it is deprecated anyway)\r\n- Added `not TYPED_AST` ignore marker to tests that require `typed_ast`\r\n- Added `IS_NEW_AST` ignore marker to tests that require `typed_ast` or `py38+`\r\n- Added `IS_PYPY` ignore marker to tests that have unicode symbols\r\n- Added `TargetVersionTestCase`\r\n- Added `BlackTestCase.test_lib2to3_parse_mocked` test case\r\n- Added `BlackTestCase.test_lib2to3_parse_mocked` test case\r\n- Added `BlackTestCase.test_parse_ast` test case\r\n- Added `BlackTestCase.test_lib2to3_unparse` test case\r\n- Added `BlackTestCase.test_patched_main` test case\r\n- Added `BlackTestCase.test_patch_click` test case\r\n- Added `BlackTestCase.test_cancel` test case\r\n\r\n### Tested\r\n\r\n- Python 3.8.0\r\n- Python 3.7.5\r\n- Python 3.6.9\r\n- PyPy3.6 7.2.0\r\n\r\nAll of the above with no `typed_ast`.

    "body": "### Idea\r\n\r\n`black` already has `left_side_split` function, but it is only used for function definitions. The idea is to extract LHS and RHS values from a string, split them separately and join them back to a final result.\r\n\r\nI added logic for splitting LHS and RHS and updated `SplitFunc` to always be aware of a target line max length. The downside of this approach is that now if LHS can be rendered to a single line - it always does. I need an advice on how to handle it correctly. Probably, we should explode LHS line if RHS has unsplittable type ignore, but it is not always safe to do this.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Removed `line_str` argument from `is_line_short_enough` function - not used\r\n- Removed `Line.is_collection_with_optional_trailing_comma` method\r\n- Removed `Line.contains_unsplittable_type_ignore` method\r\n- Added `Line.get_optional_trailing_comma_index` method\r\n- Added `Line.get_leaf_index` method\r\n- Added `Line._get_collection_comma_indexes` method - helper for `get_optional_trailing_comma_index`\r\n- Added `Line.get_unsplittable_type_ignore` method\r\n- Added `Line._get_assignment_index` method - helper to split `Line.get_left_hand_side` and `Line.get_right_hand_side` \r\n- Added `Line._get_top_level_collection_indexes` method - helper for `Line.get_optional_trailing_comma_index`\r\n- Added `Line.get_left_hand_side` method - returns line with leaves and comment for the LHS value\r\n- Added `Line.get_left_right_side`method - returns line with leaves and comment for the RHS value and assignment\r\n- Added `Line.should_be_rendered_as_single_line` method - check if line should not be exploded anf fits desired line length\r\n- Added `Line.is_short_enough` method - potential replacement for `is_line_short_enough` function, but can handle multiline `Line` as well\r\n- Added `right_hand_split_with_omit` function - replacement for `rhs` function that was created dynamically\r\n- Added `Line.get_source_line_numbers` method to check unsplittable type ignore is on the same lines as LHS\r\n- Added `split_line_side` function - `split_line` uses it for LHS and RHS\r\n- All `SplitFunc` now have `line_length` and `first_line_length` arguments\r\n- Updated unit tests\r\n\r\n### Output result changes\r\n\r\n- \r\n\r\n```python\r\n# LHS 1-item subscript output\r\nTuple[str,]\r\n# RHS 1-item subscript output\r\nMyType = Tuple[str,]\r\n\r\n# 1-arg function definition with trailing comma output\r\ndef test(\r\n    a,\r\n):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n# multi-arg function definition with trailing comma output\r\ndef test(\r\n    a,\r\n    b,\r\n):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n",

For detailed examples see [pypa/setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) project and the issue [here](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/issues/349). Starting from #981, _Black_ implemented `versioneer` for version tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR further improves the process of version tracking by proposing a switch to `setuptools-scm` package. `setuptools-scm` is a [Python Package Authority (PyPA)](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/) project, i.e. the organization that maintains many of the relevant projects in Python packaging such as `pip`, `setuptools`, `pipenv` (all of which _Black_ is using) + others.\r\n\r\nSome of the benefits of switching to `setuptools-scm` are:\r\n* Unlike `versioneer`, it does not pollute the git project directory with _version.py, versioneer.py and .gitattributes files helping the project clean. Note that a new file _version.py (different from the previous _version.py used for `versioneer`)  is going to be present and contains a single line with the version number once `python setup.py --version` runs. However, it is not going to be a part of the git directory (included in .gitignore).\r\n* As mentioned, the package is maintained by the PyPA, this means that if some changes were to happen in the future with the way packaging works there is a good chance that the `setuptools-scm` will stay compatible with these changes.\r\n* Opens a possibility of extending the `setuptools-scm` to automatically generate MANIFEST.in (which is one of the possibilities since `setuptools-scm` communicates with .git).",

Clearly in this case it's worse than the version with no blank line, but if either class had more definitions I think it would make sense:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass C:\r\n\r\n    class Inner:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n(which I guess would lead to something like \"if the previous line is a `class`, and this line is a class/function/decorator, allow 0 or 1 leading blank lines\"? should this also apply when the previous line is a `def`?)\r\n\r\ntldr: I kind of feel like this is a bit of a hack when a proper solution would be more widely applicable, see https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/450#issuecomment-436244142.

Not unlike how `setup.py`  grabs the verson, i.e., `_version_re = re.compile(r\"__version__\\s+=\\s+(?P<version>.*)\")` . However, I would prefer a nicer way to do this?

I figured it'd be better to just write the code if I were to restart this discussion.\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP. I'll finish it if I can get a thumbs up on the option itself. Blocking bits:\r\n- [x] ~~Converting spaces to tabs causes instability errors with standalone comments following indented lines (only on the first pass). I tried my hand at debugging it and found the culprit: #512. Tried to fix it but been having a hard time, and it's an issue right now either way.~~ (*this was fixed in an upstream commit*)\r\n- [ ] Again in spaces<->tabs conversion, indented docstrings get mangled. This is an issue in Black today when going from tabs to spaces. [PEP0257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#handling-docstring-indentation) defines the algorithm to handle docstring indentation; Black should probably implement it (but it kinda sucks to have to touch the AST). This is probably out of scope of this PR as well.\r\n- [ ] Tests are missing\r\n- [ ] Documentation/changelog untouched\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nI'm going to avoid trying to spark a debate on whether tabs are better than spaces, as I don't believe that's a requirement in order to include this option. Regardless whether they are or not, projects do use them and currently Black is simply not available for those projects.  Development on prettier-python (which supports tabs) has slowed down, primarily because of Black. So this leaves the Python ecosystem in a bit of a shitty place for tab users.\r\n\r\nAddressing in advance the main arguments I've heard against this landing…\r\n\r\n> Argument 1: \"Black's philosophy is not to be configurable\".\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of very carefully evaluating any new option, in any medium. Too many options have very negative consequences: Analysis paralysis, bikeshedding, confusion, added maintenance cruft, etc...\r\nI wrote a bit in the linked thread about what I called \"bikeshed bullshit\", which has been omnipresent in the linting&formatting space -- see tools like pylint/jslint/tslint, yapf, etc which have hundreds of options for whether there's whitespace and/or commas in a variety of combinatorial situations.\r\nThese aren't productive options; they exist because some people subjectively prefer code looking one way versus another.\r\n\r\nPragmatically speaking, there are reasons to use tabs. Pragmatically speaking, Black isn't available to the chunk of the Python ecosystem. This is what I aim to solve.\r\nBlack itself is pragmatic and admits that there can be *functional* reasons for certain code style options by having a --line-length option (\"paid by the LOC\"), and by having ways to disable the autoformatter for chunks of the code.\r\n\r\nSo Black's philosophy isn't \"one codestyle to rule them all\", and it shouldn't be. I think it's akin to prettier where there are no useless options. No \"bikeshed bullshit\", so to say. I believe there are excellent reasons to keep configuration to the absolute minimum, and that's been prettier's mantra as well.\r\nPrettier does have a few more configuration options, for very pragmatic reasons (compatibility with other tools, primarily). It's now used by a massive chunk of the JS ecosystem and there's never any bikeshed in any of those projects. It includes --use-tabs. I think Black should too.\r\n\r\n> Argument 2: Tabs prevent a consistent and predictable line-length.\r\n\r\n*Note: This argument does not apply to \"alignment\" as neither black nor this PR implements tab alignment*\r\n\r\nMy suggestion (and implementation) here is to always treat a tab indent as 4 spaces. This essentially neuters that discussion. In practice, that follows the PEP8 4-space rule, and it avoids having a discussion on \"oh now do we introduce an indent_size option\", which kinda brings us back to \"bikeshed bullshit\". (If you want to have a different indent size than 4... you should be using tabs, and not impose your indent preference on everyone who reads your code, that's what it's all there for)\r\n\r\nOn the technical side, I moved the Line rendering functionality to a new `Line.render()` method which can take a `force_spaces=True` argument. This is used when counting characters in a line, so that a tab indent is always counted as 4 spaces.",
