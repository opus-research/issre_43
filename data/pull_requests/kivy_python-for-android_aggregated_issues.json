      "> Incredible stuff, thanks this contribution ‚ù§Ô∏è Would you mind documenting the bootstrap here `doc/source/buildoptions.rst`, updating the documentation here `doc/source/commands.rst` and here `doc/source/quickstart.rst`. Ideally we should also update the CI to build an app on that bootstrap, see `Makefile` and `.github/workflows/push.yml`. I probably won't have a chance to play with it, but it overall looks good to me, hopefully a core dev can look this up more in depth. Until then let's see what the CI thinks about it\r\n\r\nThanks a lot :). I can do all of these things.",

So this requires the developer to purchase a QT license, or make their project fully open source.\r\n\r\nI asked around and you are absolutely right here. But, that comes under the licensing terms of Qt/PySide6. As long as one does not use the PySide6 recipe, they don't have to adhere to these licenses. This is generally similar to other recipes included in p4a like \"psycopg2\" which comes with only LGPLv3 license, and user will have to make their code open source if that recipe is used.\r\n\r\n> Are you contributing this pull request under the terms of the MIT license used by python-for-android?\r\n\r\nYes. Great question. There is a part in the commited code where I am doing a \"public class PythonActivity extends QtActivity\" and this could have raised your question. This is also pretty similar to the question here: [https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7904/can-your-mit-library-use-an-lgpl-library](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7904/can-your-mit-library-use-an-lgpl-library) and I believe the answer applies. \r\nSo, my understanding is that the commited code complies to MIT license, since \"QtActivity\" still remains in accordance with the terms of LGPL license. Apart from the mentioned line, there is no other code parts in this commit that refers to Qt API.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

By,\r\n  tweaking the memory setting we can get rid of that error.\r\n\r\n* Fix bug - check for main.py\r\n\r\n- Qt boostrap removed from comparison in the changed line because\r\n  its expects a value is args.launcher, which is not applicable for\r\n  Qt boostrap. Hence, it exits with an value not found exception.\r\n- Removing Qt boostrap from the comparison leads to checking\r\n  for main.py or --private, which is to be done for the Qt boostrap.\r\n\r\n* Make --init-classes truly optional\r\n\r\n- check if empty, otherwise store empty string\r\n\r\n* Add a non-gui test app build to CI that uses Qt bootstrap\r\n\r\n- for the purpose of testing, the pyside6 and shiboken6 wheels, the\r\n  extra .jar files needed and the recipes for pyside6 and shiboken6\r\n  are manually added into testapps/on_device_unit_tests/test_qt.\r\n  These files are normally generated by the `pyside6-android-deploy`\r\n  tool that is shipped with PySide.\r\n  Generating the wheels and the .jar files belongs to the scope of\r\n  PySide and not python-for-android. Hence, they are not done here.\r\n  This also reduces the load on the CI which will otherwise have to\r\n  cross-compile CPython and PySide.\r\n- The Android aarch64 wheels for testing are downloaded from Qt servers.\r\n  These wheels are for testing purposes only and the download link will\r\n  be updated when official PySide6 Android wheels are generated.\r\n- Tests were added in test_requirements.py so that when running the apk\r\n  the current date and time are printed on the terminal. The tests also\r\n  checks shiboken6 and PySide6 module imports.\r\n\r\n* Remove superfluous whitespace removal\r\n\r\n- This was introduced by a VSCode setting and is unrealated to this\r\n  patch.

These additions not only resolve DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) violations but also enhance testability.\r\n- Updates the testapps to use `setuptools` instead of `distutils`.\r\n- Adds a `setuptools` dependency\r\n\r\nThese changes ensure that our codebase remains compatible with Python 3.12 and eliminates any reliance on deprecated `distutils` functionality.",

The allowed orientations list is then set to `KIVY_ORIENTATION`, which is used during window setup time to populate the `SDL_HINT_ORIENTATIONS` value, as we're doing for other platforms.\r\n\r\n`--manifest-orientation` has been added to keep the `android:screenOrientation` personalisation functionality, even if Android will be likely deprecate this attribute in future. Valid values can be find [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html).\r\n\r\nIf `--manifest-orientation` is not set, and only (one of multiple) `--orientation` options are passed, the value for `android:screenOrientation` is guessed and synthesised from the `--orientation` option. Since `android:screenOrientation` accepts only 1 value, if multiple `--orientation` are given, `android:screenOrientation` will be set to `unspecified`.\r\n\r\nA `buildozer` PR will follow.\r\n\r\nP.S. : I'm slowly changing `pythonforandroid/bootstraps/common/build/build.py` in order to make it deeply testable, so some changes may seem to be unrelated, but are needed in order to actually test the code.\r\n\r\n‚ö†Ô∏è The changes applied in this PR will likely break existing third party examples and automated builds, if a now unsupported orientation setting is used, so the user will need to migrate, if needed. Specifically, `--orientation sensor` or `--orientation user` are not valid anymore, and an error will be raised, and the user will be forced to migrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "# Patching CVE-2007-4559\n\nHi, we are security researchers from the Advanced Research Center at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com). We have began a campaign to patch a widespread bug named CVE-2007-4559. CVE-2007-4559 is a 15 year old bug in the Python tarfile package. By using extract() or extractall() on a tarfile object without sanitizing input, a maliciously crafted .tar file could perform a directory path traversal attack. We found at least one unsantized extractall() in your codebase and are providing a patch for you via pull request. The patch essentially checks to see if all tarfile members will be extracted safely and throws an exception otherwise. We encourage you to use this patch or your own solution to secure against CVE-2007-4559. Further technical information about the vulnerability can be found in this [blog](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html).\n\nIf you have further questions you may contact us through this projects lead researcher [Kasimir Schulz](mailto:kasimir.schulz@trellix.com).\n",

This is another try.\r\n\r\nThere are two outstanding PRs, https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/2580 and https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/2299. And a partial solution has previously been incorporated https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/2330, but is not documented in buildozer.spec and apparently doesn't work https://github.com/kivy/buildozer/issues/1508.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on the observation that there is a simple hack for adding resources using `add_assets` and prefixing the second field with `../res/` like this \r\n```\r\nandroid.add_assets = icons/all-inclusive.png:../res/drawable/all_inclusive.png\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation simply copies the add_assets code fragments, and changes 'asset' to 'resourse'. The associated Buildozer PR is https://github.com/kivy/buildozer/pull/1513\r\n\r\nA test case is here https://github.com/RobertFlatt/add_resourse_test , this test sets a service icon (a custom service is created because setting the icon is not standard feature - but that is another issue). A drawable resource is declared using:\r\n```\r\nandroid.add_resources = icons/all-inclusive.png:drawable/all_inclusive.png\r\n```\r\nAnd the required resource ID is obtained with:\r\n```\r\n\t    iconId = getResources().getIdentifier(\"all_inclusive\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"drawable\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  getPackageName());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test service is sticky, the app can be stopped but the service and its icon continue.

      "1,2 ) These two have syntax errors, because of two `:`.  Ref: https://github.com/RobertFlatt/buildozer/blob/add_resources/buildozer/default.spec#L190-L192 \r\n\r\nWhat should these cases be? \r\n\r\n3) Yes, but I think the real issue is also shown by 2), it shows that `main/src/res` is stateful - which *I assume* it should not be. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that the `res` directory gets it initial state from the sdl2 bootstrap, by including these directories files https://github.com/RobertFlatt/python-for-android/tree/add_resources/pythonforandroid/bootstraps/sdl2/build/src/main/res  Subsequent changes are cumulative as the initialization does not occur for each build, hence the 'apparent' state. Thus the 'apparent' state is an artifact of the build architecture.  \r\n\r\nSince the bootstrap is completely separate, a resolution to make `res` stateless is a copy of the res from the fist pass. Presumably would be bootstrap independent. At the start of code where resources are added:\r\n```\r\n# of the general form:\r\nres_dir_initial = \"src/res_initial\"\r\nif exists(res_dir_initial):\r\n    rmtree(res_dir)\r\n    copytree(res_dir_initial, res_dir)\r\nelse:\r\n    copytree(res_dir, res_dir_initial)\r\n```\r\nIs there a better way? (please be specific)\r\n\r\nSubsequent copytree() would have `dirs_exist_ok=True`\r\n\r\nSo user options override defaults, and specific options override general options. Which seems reasonable. (to me) \r\n\r\n4) Enhancement:\r\nWhile this PR allows specifying files or directories as resources of a given kind, it does not allow a single specification of a directory of resources of many kinds. There is no way to specify a single directory containing `drawable` and `xml` and....\r\n\r\nI propose changing the semantics of the zero `:` syntax, this would add the third case below. The current usage is trivial (an implicit `drawable:drawable`) and can be implemented in case 2 below. The internal implementation is to make `resource_dest == \"\"` in this case.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# (list) Put these files in the apk res directory.\r\n# The option may be used in three ways, the value may contain one or zero ':'\r\n# Some examples:\r\n# 1) A file to add to resources, legal resource names contain ['a-z','0-9','_']\r\n# android.add_resources = my_icons/all-inclusive.png:drawable/all_inclusive.png\r\n# 2) A directory, here  'legal_icons' must contain resources of one kind\r\n# android.add_resources = legal_icons:drawable\r\n# 3) A directory,here 'legal_resources' must contain one or more directories, \r\n# each of a resource kind:  drawable, xml, etc...\r\n# android.add_resources = legal_resources\r\n``` \r\n\r\nImplemented except TODO the buildozer.spec template to the comments above.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  ",

(I'm just not sure that `--add-resource` is something self-explanatory in that case., and we need to document that  a [case 4] + [case 1,2,3] could be used at the same time, but the order may change the final result, in case of a file that overrides another one)\r\n\r\nLooks like we found the final solution for the resources drama, can you also take care of the `python-for-android` docs in this PR, in order to document this feature?",

      "Hi @SomberNight !\r\n\r\nFrom: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line#tools-sdk\r\n\r\n>Located in: android_sdk/cmdline-tools/version/bin/\r\n\r\n>Note: The Android SDK Command-Line Tools package, located in cmdline-tools, replaces the SDK Tools package, located in tools. With the new package, you can select the version of the command line tools you want to install, and you can install multiple versions at a time. With the old package, you can only install the latest version of the tools. Thus, the new package lets you depend on specific versions of the command-line tools without having your code break when new versions are released. For information about the deprecated SDK Tools package, see the [SDK Tools release notes](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/sdk-tools).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as @dbnicholson said in #2593 :\r\n> This could definitely be better by looking for other versions of cmdline-tools instead of just latest.\r\n\r\nSo, `${ANDROID_SDK_HOME}/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager` is not a valid path for installs, at least for Google.\r\n\r\nI've just tried to install multiple versions (`6.0` and `latest`)  via Android Studio and that how my folder structure now looks like:\r\n```\r\n(venv) mirko@Mirkos-MacBook-Pro python-for-android % ls -l /Users/mirko/.buildozer/android/platform/android-sdk/cmdline-tools \r\ntotal 0\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 mirko  staff  224  8 Oct 14:55 6.0\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 mirko  staff  224  8 Oct 14:52 latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess we have to migrate our docs and/or automated installs instead of supporting a new (non-standard) folder structure.",
      "> So, `${ANDROID_SDK_HOME}/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager` is not a valid path for installs, at least for Google.\r\n\r\nHmm, so are we not supposed to just simply unzip the tools google hosts, but are now expected to move stuff around to have a specific layout?",
      "I spent a while looking at this trying to figure out how to only download the command line tools once, but this is the bootstrapping procedure I came up with.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\twget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-$(PLATFORM)-7583922_latest.zip\r\n\trm -rf cmdline-tools\r\n\tunzip commandlinetools-$(PLATFORM)-7583922_latest.zip\r\n# This is unfortunate since it will download the command line tools\r\n# again, but after this it will be properly installed and updatable.\r\n\tyes y | ./cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager \"cmdline-tools;latest\" --sdk_root=$(SDK)\r\n\trm -rf cmdline-tools\r\n\trm commandlinetools-$(PLATFORM)-7583922_latest.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a couple `make` variables in there, but I think it should be pretty clear. After that `$(SDK)/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager` can be used normally without passing `--sdk_root` and the package is properly installed and updatable. You could obviously install a different version than `latest`.",

If you were building with -fno-integrated-as you'll need to remove that flag. See [Clang Migration Notes](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/refs/heads/master/docs/ClangMigration.md) for advice on making assembly compatible with LLVM.\r\n- GDB has been removed. Use LLDB instead. Note that ndk-gdb uses LLDB by default, and Android Studio has only ever supported LLDB.\r\n- Jelly Bean (APIs 16, 17, and 18) is no longer supported. The minimum OS supported by the NDK is KitKat (API level 19).\r\n- Non-Neon devices are no longer supported. A very small number of very old devices do not support Neon so most apps will not notice aside from the performance improvement.\r\n- RenderScript build support has been removed. RenderScript was [deprecated](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/deprecations#renderscript) in Android 12. If you have not finished migrating your apps away from RenderScript, NDK r23 LTS can be used.\r\n- Includes Android 13 APIs.\r\n- Updated LLVM to clang-r450784d, based on LLVM 14 development.\r\n\r\nEverything can happen, but that should not impact any of our recipes (I've been on NDK 25 for a month now).",

    "body": "This enables `WorkManager` tasks via the `--worker` p4a option. This is based on the work in #2464, with the following differences:\r\n\r\n* Support is added in the common bootstrap rather than the service_library bootstrap so it can be used by p4a apps. I believe it should still work in the service_library context, but I haven't tested.\r\n* I removed the bound service addition. That might still be useful, but my goal was to support `WorkManager` tasks, and that wasn't needed. I believe in #2464 they were using the bound service as the target for the `WorkManager` tasks, but I changed it so that each worker has a generated service class. The generated service class is based on `RemoteWorkerService`, which itself implements a bound service.\r\n\r\nAn important thing to note is that since p4a only supports one python interpreter per process (see #2609), the work task is always run in a separate process via a `RemoteListenableWorker`. That seems to work well except that I couldn't get [cancellation to work](https://issuetracker.google.com/234211438). The downside of this approach is that the androidx work-multiprocess release including this support requires SDK 30.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the work is in the \"Support WorkManager tasks\" commit. Everything before that is preparation, which could be split out into a separate PR if that's preferred.\r\n\r\nThere are still a couple things I haven't completed:\r\n\r\n- [x] I added a `--worker` test in the on-device tests, but it's only being run in the flask webview app. It would be good to be able to test it in the kivy app, too.\r\n- [ ] I haven't tested foreground handling and the `PythonWorker` class doesn't implement the `getForegroundInfoAsync()` and `getForegroundInfo()` methods.\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [ ] ~~Currently there's ugly `WorkManager.initialize` call in the generated worker service since the androidx startup handling doesn't seem to work on remote processes. It seems to work, but I don't think it's the right way to do it.~~ This isn't ideal, but I think it's fine this way.",

      "I fleshed this out some more and got cancellation to work. It turns out that I was just doing it wrong and blocking on the python thread in the worker. That's wrong as it doesn't allow the future to be returned and `WorkManager` doesn't get it until the python process has completed.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I spent some time trying to make sure the worker service always exits since you can get strange errors if you run python more than once in a process. That works most of the time, but sometimes if you cancel work and then run work to completion it won't exit since the service is still bound from the cancelled work. I think you'd need to address #2610 so that the python thread could be stopped without killing the whole process.\r\n\r\nLastly, I have some work in progress on `getForegroundInfoAsync()`, but I ran out of time right now to complete it. I might be able to get to that in the next week."

This will be changed in future.\r\n\r\n- This will allow, when completed, to simplify the onboarding process of a new `python-for-android` / `buildozer` user, as `python-for-android` is expected to run all the checks and (eventually) the needed installations. Lowering the \"first-customer\" entry barriers will mean fewer support tickets and increasing the `Kivy` ecosystem fan base üòÑ .\r\n\r\n- \"Check, even multiple times before installing anything\" approach. As an example, `JDKPrerequisite` is checking the availability of a valid `JDK` over multiple places, installing a new one should be a last resort, and an installation should be done only if the user consents.\r\n\r\nAs a working example, https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/2586 has been updated to use this approach.\r\n\r\n- `ubuntu-latest`, doesn't have any rule (yet) so just ignores it.\r\n- `macos-latest` have a valid JDK pre-installed, but is not the default one. `JDKPrerequisite` notices it and sets `JAVA_HOME` to the valid JDK path.\r\n- `apple-silicon-m1` doesn't have a valid JDK installed. `JDKPrerequisite` notices it and downloads+installs `OpenJDK17U-jdk_aarch64_mac_hotspot_17.0.2_8`, allowing the CI run to complete.\r\n",

      "> That works for me if we prefer it that way.\r\n> One thing I liked about installing it manually was that in a way it documented how to reproduce it from the command line in macOS.\r\n> Say that I didn't have a macOS laptop, but I was testing things on a VM üòè\r\n> https://github.com/AndreMiras/VagrantBoxes/tree/master/osx-sierra\r\n> Then this can be useful because you can up your VM and run the same script\r\n\r\nConsidering that improving the setup process and docs should be a priority, I got your point and I agree.\r\n\r\nI will try to investigate an approach that works for both the `Github Actions` environment and the one which could have a user, so let's keep this PR paused.\r\n\r\nCurrently, during the CI run we're installing the JDK via `brew install --cask adoptopenjdk13`, but without changing the `JAVA_HOME` env var, which means that during the CI run the default (In that case OpenJDK 8 IIRC) is being used.\r\nThat has been un-noticeable until the newer Gradle (introduced in #2586) was expecting an OpenJDK version > 11.\r\n\r\nJust thinking out loud: I imagine that a \"prerequisites lookup and install script\" that inspects the user / CI runner environment and asks to perform the prerequisites installations may avoid installing an un-needed JDK version for both the users and CI runners?",
      "Oh right I see thanks for sharing more context.\r\nYeah maybe an helper script that we ship with p4a and use in the CI could make sense too indeed.\r\nBut I don't want it to make it more painful for you to work on the CI then.\r\nI mean having a documented and easy to reproduce process is one thing, but it should be balanced with the rest.\r\nSo if that change from your PR end up being much easier than something else, we can stick with it.\r\nOr we can also merge it as it is and make a follow up later to introduce the reusable script",

      "> Thanks for giving it a though and providing an implementation. Looks good to me, that's probably enough for a start. In future post merge iteration we may want to:\r\n> \r\n> * set the JDK version from a single place\r\n> * cover the change via tests\r\n> * document the feature for user interested to use it\r\n\r\nYeah, absolutely.\r\n\r\nI've scheduled a major docs review for `python-for-android`, which will land just after the #2586 splicing is completed, as it seems (at least on macOS) we have some outdated docs.\r\n\r\nInstead, tests will inevitably land in the next related PR, as (now that I can have a clearer idea of which are the needs) I will switch to a TDD approach for the next prerequisites."

      "Some updates (and maybe we can consider that ready to be reviewed):\r\n\r\n- NDK `r23b` is not yet _completely_ ready for **Apple Silicon** support, full support landed recently in non-LTS versions, (`r24`, ...) but it should be less painful for us to support the next NDK releases.\r\n\r\n- NDK `r23b` completely removes the GNU Binutils  ( excluding the GNU Assembler (GAS) )  and `platforms/android-*` folders have been removed in NDK `>=r22`. As a downside, a lot of recipes needed some changes, and not everything has been tested on runtime. \r\n\r\n- `lapack` recipe needs a toolchain with `fortran` support to build and generate code. LLVM now has included support for `flang` https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/flang, so I tried to build the whole [android-toolchain](https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm_android/+/master/README.md) (which is based on LLVM) with flang support, and seems that worked, but  `flang-new` is still not able to provide code-generation, so `gfortran` (or another fortran compiler) is needed for that step. (Maybe @mzakharo could help us in the process to migrate it to a newer NDK version ?)\r\n\r\n- Previously `NDKPLATFORM` env var was set to `arch.ndk_platform`. Now that `platforms/android-*` folders have been removed, `NDKPLATFORM` still needs to be populated with a dummy value cause we're using that var as a switch into our projects setup scripts ( `kivy`, `pyjnius`, `audiostream` ...). Maybe we can change it to something more explicit in the future like `KIVY_PLATFORM=android` or  `KIVY_PLATFORM=ios` ?.\r\n\r\n- As said before, even if I tried to cover everything that looked to fail on the CI, some recipes will likely need some more love, but IMHO, the only effective way that we currently have to discover them is to merge this PR and wait for some feedback from the community.\r\n",
      "@misl6  @AndreMiras Don't merge yet, give me a day to run a full test on all the recipes locally on my local machine. (I can't dream of encountering any bug while compiling to apk in the future)",
      "@misl6 the compilation crashes at downloading NDK r23b. I made some checks on the download page and saw that ```x86_64``` has been removed from the download name url\r\n\r\nstill testing ............",

(This is necessary due to https://github.com/google/bundletool/issues/190)\r\n\r\n- The new `lib/xxx/private.so` is now unpacked from the `getApplicationInfo().nativeLibraryDir` reported folder to the same target as before.\r\n\r\n- Now the version check is skipped for obvious reasons. We should re-implement this feature via (as an example) an md5 hash? (Better if We do that at build time, skipping the md5 hash generation during runtime)\r\n\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Discuss the version management issue\r\n- [x] Optimize the `private.so`by splitting it in two parts (ABI-specific parts(`_python_bundle`)) and NON-ABI-specific (that could be shipped into assets like We're already doing))\r\n- [x] Instead of creating multiple dists for each ABI, create a single dist with multiple `_python_bundle` so it is easier to build the bundle later.\r\n- [x] Add the option to build multiple ABIs at the same time.\r\n- [x] Add the needed code to build the bundle.\r\n- [x] Test the generated bundle on Play Console and generate ABI-specific apks via `bundletool`.\r\n- [ ] Drop current apk generation method.\r\n- [x] Fix issue: If the user builds in debug mode, and later in release mode, it fails due to gdb files in libs/arch folder.\r\n\r\nI rarely have some spare time, so help is always appreciated.\r\n",

I will look at them later.\r\n- As a collateral, now We support multi-arch apk.\r\n- I tested the generated `.aab`via `bundletool build-apks` and `bundletool install-apks` locally and it works!\r\n- Only `sdl2` bootstrap is now migrated.\r\n- Some recipes could be broken.\r\n- I still have to check if the generated `.aab` passes the Google Play validation.",

Therefor we'd need a mechanism to optionally \"merge\" several bootstraps, e.g. a kivy app might depend on sdl and workmanager bootstraps or you would like to create a aar library including workmanager feature. We also might just add workmanager and bound service support to common bootstrap, but this implies some more build dependencies (androidx.work:work-runtime, androidx.work:work-multiprocess, androidx.concurrent:concurrent-futures)\r\n\r\nWhile playing around with starting python in main.c, we came along the problem with injecting sys.exit when python ends. When using workmanager workers this would just kill the entire application so we made it optional. If someone can explain why injecting sys.exit is needed at all this would be nice.\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n\r\n* [ ] Figure out the original need of injecting sys.exit when python ends and whether and when this needs to be kept.\r\n* [ ] Discuss whether to create a dedicated bootstrap for workmanager, or maybe just add it to common bootstraps since workmanager and bound service support are in general useful features\r\n* [ ] If added to common bootstraps, add some convenience API to android recipe to work with services and work managers.\r\n* [ ] Proper python shutdown if system requests workers to stop\r\n* [ ] Cleanup\r\n* [ ] Documentation",

I skimmed through this article and only left with impression that the naming is completely arbitrary. The kivy, plyer and dozens of other projects call the most recent branch as \"master\" instead of \"develop\". And use branch called \"stable\" or \"vX.X\" for latest stable code",

The devs would need to know of these reasons to consider them.  It sounds like the lower the barriers to understanding the project are, the more small fixes can come in from other projects.  Changing things like this is usually something that would happen slowly with discussion, because many people have been working with it this way for a long time.",
      "The reason I asked is because this issue revealed to me that I was not the only one surprised by branch naming. If this becomes a significant enough annoyance for new contributors, then it may be worth to consider aligning the branch naming with kivy and most other projects. Another related issue is that git, github and many other projects are changing the \"master\" to \"main\", which is covered here: https://github.com/github/renaming. So if the p4a project going to align the naming with the rest of the world, then i would suggest to use \"main\" for the most recent stuff and \"stable\" for latest stable release.",
      "Thanks for explaining.\r\nUsing main and stable just feel as arbitrary to me. Both are documented workflows from different sources and we decided to chose Git-flow so far on p4a.\r\nRegarding pull requesting on the correct branch this is done automatically on the default branch (which is `develop`) when you open a pull request unless someone changes it. It has happened a couple of times, but I don't feel it's something to worry about"

Because of the file management uncertainties introduced in the context of `p4a`, this author will not use this approach.\r\n\r\nThe previous support library is depreciated. There is an argument that AndroidX should be enabled by default. This would impact users who specify an existing support package in `gradle_dependencies`. And there may be some other unforeseen impact. Alternatively AndroidX could be enabled by `api` version, but this would not be transparent to users. I think AndroidX should be enabled by default, but not yet; so it is enabled by build command option. \r\n\r\nAs an example user dependency consider https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/2200 , it depends on the Android support library but is agnostic to which one. However the user code required does depend on the chosen support library, the change is in a Java class name, and in the name of the `gradle_dependencies` package. \r\n\r\nThe need for https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/2200 is wide spread; for example the `plyer` camera https://github.com/kivy/plyer/blob/master/plyer/platforms/android/camera.py uses a 'file url' which can no longer be used between Activities, so is not functional with api =29 or greater.

      "@adin234 -  Since I am unable to reproduce your issue, you might have to do this a different way:  clone lapack into a standalone folder, and manually set all the global variables in your console to point to correct NDK folders, until cmake is able to correctly configure, identify proper CC/LD binaries, and compile the lapack project.  Once that works, you can try and see what's different in the p4a build flow. Good luck!",

In the linked issue is a lot of background and the OP also contains a link to a minimal example.\r\n\r\nTheir build with p4a targeting Python 3.8 was failing with link errors. Their workaround was to manually link to `libpython3.8m.so`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I understood the `m` suffix was removed with Python 3.8 after pymalloc builds became ABI-compatible with the mainline: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#build-and-c-api-changes\r\n\r\nSo I think that `libpython3.8m.so` is a non-standard name for libpython, and propose here the `m` suffix is dropped by p4a.\r\n\r\nI am very new to the p4a codebase, so please give me a heads-up for any other sections of the code that should be adjusted for this and I'm happy to round off this PR.",

Why would it introduce a regression?\r\n\r\n> Or was it backward compatible for a long while?\r\n\r\nWas what backward compatible? I'm missing some context here :sweat_smile: \r\n\r\nThe problem is caused by the fact that `sys.stdout.buffer` is normally an `_io.BufferedWriter`, so the current code is not conforming to the expected interface for `sys.stdout` (as used by e.g. recent versions of `click`):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> sys.stdout.buffer\r\n<_io.BufferedWriter name='<stdout>'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stderr:\r\n> To write or read binary data from/to the standard streams, use the underlying binary buffer object. For example, to write bytes to stdout, use sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'abc').\r\n\r\nThis has been the case since python 3.0.",

As far as I can tell, `click`:\r\n* checks for `.buffer` and assumes it is a binary stream if not `None` (and uses the original text stream if there's no `.buffer`)\r\n* detects a `LogFile` as both \"compatible\" and \"misconfigured\" (because it has no `.encoding`)\r\n* changed the logic (somewhere since version `7.0`) and no longer accepts a text stream that is \"compatible\" but \"misconfigured\"\r\n* and thus now tries to use the `.buffer` binary stream because the `LogFile` is considered \"misconfigured\"\r\n\r\nSo I'm not expecting a regression.

It does affect the compileSdkVersion in the build.gradle, which looks like probably a correct change, and it also makes the targetSdkVersion equal to that old api number. However, it's highly deliberate that the compile version and targetSdkVersion don't currently match, because as far as I was aware that's a reasonable thing to do. It is quite important because we specifically compile against an old api (21), so that we're compatible with anything after that, but the app should still use a recent targetSdkVersion so that it's allowed on the Play store etc.\r\n\r\nAre you saying that this mismatch is not allowed? Has something changed in Android 10 in particular to cause problems? Or have I misremembered the names of the different variables.",
      "Sorry, yeah, the way I wrote it was confusing, and was based off my (faulty) memory. There was a point where I thought the C/C++ compilation was the problem, but in fact it is the min == compile SDK requirement that led to our problem. I'll update the title and description of the ticket to be less confusing, and have provided some explanation below to make it clearer what this change is about.\r\n\r\nThe specific issue we ran into was when we added the `usesClearTextTraffic` flag to the manifest, as is done here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/commit/5d329bf49ae37c988dd4caa5f1192cd7cf6146e9\r\n\r\nUsing this is a hard requirement for allowing HTTP traffic on Android 8.0+. For this to compile, we needed to specify a compile SDK that knows about the `usesClearTextTraffic` property, which meant using compile SDKs for 8.0 or above. However, currently, that means we need to set our min SDK to the 8.0 version as well, even though we're trying to support versions down to 5.0 (and maybe 4.4 if we can figure that out!). Essentially, in the current code, we need to choose between only supporting Android versions 5-7, or only supporting versions >= 8.\r\n\r\nWith `minSDKVersion=21` and `compileSDKVersion=29`, though, we can use any feature in that series of releases. If it's a manifest change (e.g. `usesClearTextTraffic`), it will get ignored on old versions but used on newer ones. If it's a Java API, we just need to be careful to do a (pseudocode) `if (android_version >= 8.0) { /*... 8.0+ specific code here ... */ }` to use the API.\r\n\r\nThere's a very long and detailed article about this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/androiddevelopers/picking-your-compilesdkversion-minsdkversion-targetsdkversion-a098a0341ebd\r\n\r\nBut the TL;DR is that your `compileSDKVersion` should match your `targetSDKVersion` so that you can incorporate anything required by versions > min (like `usesClearTextTraffic`), and let the min SDK determine the lowest version you can support.\r\n\r\n",
      "Thanks for the explanation. I understand the general goal, and we definitely want to get it right, but as far as I can see we already set the compileSdkVersion to match the targetSdkVersion and your PR doesn't affect that. Instead, your PR gets the android_api from the $ANDROID_API environment variable, and makes it so that if it's ever read from project.properties (although as you note this may never happen) it will actually retrieve the wrong value and target an old api.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we're currently updating project.properties after the first write, but for projects built with correct api numbers from the start it doesn't seem like this changes anything.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?",
      "No, sorry, you're right, this is totally my bad. It's 'fixing' a problem that I created in the first place by changing what we output to `project.properties`. Looking at the state of current develop, it seems right to me, but that leaves me wondering how we ran into the issue in the first place. \r\n\r\nI'm going to close out this PR, and check through my code changes again to see if there's some other change that I am missing. If I find something, I'll post it, otherwise sorry for wasting your time with this! ",
      "Thanks for checking! It's totally possible (maybe likely even) that you hit some buggy code path that led to bad results, so do feel free to open another PR if you find it. p4a used to not handle this right at all, and I fixed it a while back to set the variables the current way, but something could definitely have been missed."

This depends on the File System where the build happens. It will be named `python.exe` when the FS is case-insensitive (Mac OSX and Cygwin), but it will be named `python` when the FS is case-sensitive (most GNU Linux distributions). The proposed solution consists in make a copy of the generated python binary with a given name (python3 or python2) so this way\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal we refactor a little our `HostPythonRecipe`:\r\n¬† - add private property `HostPythonRecipe._exe_name` (the name of the python executable based on major version)\r\n¬† - add public property `HostPythonRecipe.python_exe` (the full path of the python executable)\r\n¬† - implement `HostPythonRecipe.should_build`\r\n\r\nAnd also it's affected the `GuestPythonRecipe`, because we need to use the generated python executable by `HostPythonRecipe`:\r\n¬† - add private property `GuestPythonRecipe._libpython` (python's library name with extension...hardcoded for now...)\r\n¬† - implement `GuestPythonRecipe.should_build`... to check the library instead of the executable so we avoid conflicts with case-insensitive FS\r\n\r\nWe also need:\r\n  - fix `PythonRecipe.real_hostpython_location` because the name of our host python executable will depend on major version\r\n¬† - fix python2 interpreter (fix-interpreter-version.patch)\r\n\r\nNote: the variation of the name of the python's executable is mentioned at python's build docs (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/README.rst#build-instructions)\r\n\r\nNote: @TheSin- , ¬°¬°¬°thanks for your debugging sessions!!!\r\n\r\n* [ci] Add Mac OSX CI's test & refactor android's NDK/SDK installation\r\n\r\nTo do so we:\r\n¬† - create a makefile to install the necessary dependencies for Mac OS X: `ci/makefiles/osx.mk`\r\n¬† - create a makefile to install android's SDK/NDK:¬†`ci/makefiles/android.mk`\r\n¬† - refactor docker files: make use of android's makefile\r\n  - change OS, from `linux` to `osx`, for CI test `Python 3 armeabi-v7a`, so we don't increase the overall build time and jobs\r\n¬† - rename the `Python 2` test to `Python 2 armeabi-v7a (with numpy)` to reflect the build arch and numpy's build.\r\n\r\n* customizability (#1869)\r\n\r\n* customizability options - added compile-options\r\n\r\n* apptheme option for all bootstraps\r\n\r\n* Initial migration to NDK r19 (Part I - The core) (#1722)\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Rework of the arch environment to work with ndk r19+\r\n\r\nThings done here:\r\n\r\n  - Modifies target so we can use the toolchains `in-place` (as if we were using a standalone toolchain)\r\n  - Removes some cflags that we don't need anymore\r\n  - Move `macros` and `includes` from `CFLAGS` to `CPPFLAGS` (because this is the way it's supposed to be)\r\n  - Move libraries from `LDFLAGS` to `LDLIBS` (again, the same as above)\r\n  - Refactor `Arch`'s variables into class attributes, to make `get_env` smaller and to be more readable/maintainable:\r\n    + class attributes for flags:\r\n      * common_cflags\r\n      * common_cppflags\r\n      * common_ldflags\r\n      * common_ldlibs\r\n      * common_ldshared\r\n      * arch_cflags\r\n    + class attributes for compiler:\r\n      * clang_path\r\n      * clang_exe\r\n      * clang_exe_cxx\r\n  - Remove hardcoded cpu count in `MAKE`\r\n  - Remove `gcc` of environment (because it has been partially removed in ndk r18)\r\n  - Shorten long line to be pep8 friendly (line where we define env['BUILDLIB_PATH'])\r\n  - Commented lines for `ArchAarch_64` that it seems tha we don't need anymore (not removed because I'm not sure if we need them)\r\n\r\nNote: This will force us to use a minimal ndk version of 19\r\n\r\nSee also: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/other_build_systems\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update `test_archs` to ndk's r19+ build system\r\n\r\nAlso add some more tests.

The only side effect detected is that the python's `zlib` module isn't built anymore. This is caused because python3 and python2 build systems contains libz's hardcoded version, which does not match the version used in ndk 19 (may be this the cause of some `zip/unzip` errors reported in python-for-android's issues?). We will take care later of this zlib problem, or we will get a runtime crash...so it seems that zlib is an `essential module` to successfully run a python-for-android app\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update libffi to version post `v3.3RC0`\r\n\r\nand adapt it to be ndk r19+ compatible\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix build of python's zlib module\r\n\r\nBecause python has a hardcoded zlib version which does not match android's ndk r19, and that prevents the build of zlib's module\r\n\r\nNote: it seems that we have to point to the right lib and headers, otherwise we won't succeed in building python's zlib module\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix build of python2's _ctypes module for ndk r19+\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix numpy for ndk r19+\r\n\r\nNote: because of the new build system recently introduced, we can safely remove some of the patches that we needed because it seems that it builds and runs fine without them\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update docs with the new ndk requirements\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Set min/max/recommended android's NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Make CI tests with android's NDK `r19b`\r\n\r\nBecause it's our minimum supported android NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix png recipe for NDK r19+\r\n\r\nWe remove `get_recipe_env` because we don't need anymore to specify the flags set in there.\r\n\r\nNote: As per new NDK r19+ build system implemented in p4a, the removed `flags` should be automatically set by the android's NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Add `-fPIC` to `armeabi-v7a`'s arch cflags...\r\n\r\n...force `Position-Independent Code`\r\n\r\nTo solve the kivy's build error detected in travis `OSX` test (https://travis-ci.org/kivy/python-for-android/jobs/576204088#L1105). But also detected the same error in  my local tests (linux os in this case) for `freetype` and `harfbuzz` recipes...so I have the feeling that this is better to set as global :crossed_fingers:..is it?\r\n\r\n* [LIBS - PART I] Initial refactor of library recipes (#1944)\r\n\r\nThis commit will introduce a new cls attribute: `built_libraries`.\r\nThis `built_libraries` attribute must be a dictionary. The keys are the full library name, e.g.: `libffi.so`. And the values must be the relative path of the library, e.g: `.libs`. So the this cls attribute for libffi recipe it would look like:\r\n    ```built_libraries = {'libffi.so': '.libs'}```\r\n\r\nThis new cls attribute will allow us to detect library recipes and to refactor common operations that we do for those kind of recipes:\r\n  - copy library into right location\r\n  - implement `should_build` for library recipes\r\n\r\nThose two things will make that our rebuilds to be more consistent and I hope that it will be easier to maintain. \r\n\r\n**So, once explained a little this PR, in here we do:**\r\n  - [x] Add attribute `built_libraries`\r\n  - [x] Add methods to refactor common library operations:\r\n    - [x] install_libraries\r\n    - [x] get_libraries\r\n  - [x] implement `should_build` for library recipes\r\n  - [x] implement basic tests for the newly introduced `Recipe` methods\r\n  - [x] Make use of those Library attributes/methods for some basic set of recipes:\r\n    - [x] libffi\r\n    - [x] openssl\r\n    - [x] png\r\n    - [x] jpeg\r\n    - [x] freetype\r\n    - [x] harfbuzz\r\n    - [x] libcurl\r\n    - [x] libzbar\r\n    - [x] libiconv\r\n    - [x] libexpat\r\n    - [x] libogg\r\n    - [x] libxml2\r\n    - [x] libxslt\r\n    - [x] libshine\r\n    - [x] libx264\r\n    - [x] libglob\r\n    - [x] libsodium\r\n    - [x] libsecp256k1\r\n\r\n**Things to do in separate PRs**, to be easy to review and because those points will start to conflict with the `NDK r19 migration` thing just merged:\r\n  - Make use of Library attributes/methods introduced in this PR for un covered library recipes in here. Here we have two situations:\r\n     - library recipes that depends on android's STL library (almost all the work done in here will depend of the `NDK r19 migration` thing)\r\n     - all remaining library recipes, which are not STL lib dependent and that are not implemented in here (because I was unable to perform a successful build with them using arch `arm64-v8a`...so I think it would  be better to deal with those recipes in separate PRs and later...with the `NDK r19 migration` thing merged)\r\n\r\n**Notes about changed recipes:** all the recipes touched in here almost have the same changes:\r\n  - remove `should_build` method (to make use of the one implemented in base class for library recipes)\r\n  - remove the copy of the library (because that will be done automatically by the method `install_libraries` implemented in base class)\r\n  - fixed the imports due to refactoring\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Add attribute Recipe.built_libraries\r\n\r\nso we can refactor some essential operations performed for library recipes (like copy the library into the right location, or decide if we should build the library recipe again)\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Add method Recipe.get_libraries\r\n\r\nThis function will allows us to get a list of the built/context libraries.\r\nThis will be useful to check if we have to built a library recipe or which library should be rebuild\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make `Recipe.should_build` decide the library build\r\n\r\nIn case that the attribute built_libraries has been set, we will check the need of the recipe build, otherwise we will act as usual, forcing the build unless overwrote in subclass\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Add method `Recipe.install_libraries`\r\n\r\nSo we can:\r\n  - control the copy of the library recipe\r\n  - refactor the install of the lib for all library recipes\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libffi a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make openssl a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make png a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make jpeg a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make freetype a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make harfbuzz a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libcurl a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libzbar a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libiconv a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libexpat a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso:\r\n  - make the imports from the right module\r\n  - remove hardcoded arch\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libogg a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libxml2 a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libxslt a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libshine a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso:\r\n  - make the imports from the right module\r\n  - remove the hardcoded cpu count when compiling\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libx264 a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso:\r\n¬† - make the imports from the right module\r\n¬† - remove the hardcoded cpu count when compiling\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libglob a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libsodium a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso:\r\n¬† - make the imports from the right module\r\n¬† - fix hardcoded arch\r\n¬† - enable cpu count when compiling\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libsecp256k1 a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [tests] Add tests for library recipe\r\n\r\n* [NDK19] Fix libglob for android NDK r19\r\n\r\n- change the `ARG_MAX` define, because it's already defined at `sysroot/usr/include/linux/limits.h`\r\n- Replaced `size_t` by Including the <stddef.h> header.

[This is because](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain):\r\n\r\n`As of r19, the NDK's default toolchains are standalone toolchains, which renders this process unnecessary.`\r\n\r\nNote: since 3887d2b, `python-for-android` uses android's NDK r19 as the minimum supported and also changed the build method used by p4a as [described in here](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/other_build_systems)\r\n\r\n* Also copy the service/main.py when building with setup.py (#1936)\r\n\r\n* [recipe-stl] Rework of protobuf_cpp recipe (#1969)\r\n\r\nIn here we do:\r\n  - inherit from CppCompiledComponentsPythonRecipe Because depends on android's STL library\r\n  - make use of the base class methods for library recipes\r\n  - Split build_arch into proper methods\r\n  - Shorten some long lines (to be PEP8 friendly)\r\n  - make generated library shared\r\n  - remove recipe from CI/constants\r\n\r\n* [CI] Fix CI's test for `arm64-v8a` (#1977)\r\n\r\n* Updated README.md to clarify NDK versions (#1981)\r\n\r\n* :books: Updated README.dm to clarify NDK versions\r\n\r\n* :wrench: Change back to r19b\r\n\r\n* A bunch of tests for library recipes (#1982)\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to test as many recipes as we can with the less code possible and without creating any file/directory so our tests can be performed as fast as possible (all this tests will only add between 2 and 3 seconds to our CI tests and will cover almost 100% of the code for each tested recipe)\r\n\r\nTo do so, we create a couple of modules:\r\n\r\n    tests.recipe_ctx: allow us to create a proper Context to test our recipes\r\n    tests.recipe_lib_test: which holds some base classes to be used to test a recipe depending on the build method used. For starters we introduce two kind of base classes:\r\n        BaseTestForMakeRecipe: To test an standard library build (this will iinclude the recipes which requires the classical build commandsconfigure/make)\r\n        BaseTestForCmakeRecipe: To test an library recipe which is compiled with cmake\r\n\r\nWe also refactor the existing recipes tests, so we can remove some lines in there...the ones that creates a Context.\r\n\r\n* [test] Add module `tests.recipe_ctx`\r\n\r\nA helper module to test recipes.\r\nHere we will initialize a `Context` to test recipes.\r\n\r\n* [test] Refactor `setUp/tearDown` for `test_icu`\r\n\r\n* [test] Refactor `setUp/tearDown` for `test_pyicu`\r\n\r\n* [test] Refactor `setUp` for `test_reportlab`\r\n\r\n* [test] Refactor `setUp` for `test_gevent`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add module `tests.recipe_lib_test`\r\n\r\nA helper module to test recipes which will allow to test any recipe using `configure/make` commands.\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libffi`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libexpat`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libcurl`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libiconv`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libogg`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libpq`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libsecp256k1`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libshine`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libvorbis`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libx264`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libxml2`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libxslt`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `png`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `freetype`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `harfbuzz`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `openssl`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add `BaseTestForCmakeRecipe`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `jpeg` and clean code\r\n\r\nWe can remove the `get_recipe_env` because the environment that we use is already using a clang as default compiler (not the case when we migrated the jpeg recipe to use `cmake`)...so we can do a little refactor :)\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `snappy`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `leveldb`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libgeos`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `libmysqlclient`\r\n\r\n* [test] Add test for `openal`\r\n\r\n* [test] Make the `super` calls Python3 style\r\n\r\n* [test] Move mock tests outside context manager...\r\n\r\nBecause there is no need to do it there.\r\n\r\nAlso rewrote the inline comments.\r\n\r\n* Recipes tests enhancements (#1984)\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up of #1982\r\n\r\nIn here we do:\r\n  - Move from `__new__` to `__init__` for `BaseTestForMakeRecipe` ([discussed at here](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/1982#discussion_r324419892))\r\n  - Convert cls attributes to instance attributes ([discussed at here](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/1982#discussion_r324419973))\r\n  -  Remove `mock` dependency for py3 tests (Because, as per Python 3.3+, `mock` it's a built-in-module).

      "Unsurprisingly there are some minor test failures, but the app builds seem to work fine. I'll see if I can fix it quickly.\r\n\r\nI'm finding that test_pythonpackage.py runs out my ram within a few seconds, which didn't happen in the past. Not sure what's up there.",
      "I actually often skip the `test_pythonpackage.py` in local because for me it always ran for ages",

So, as @AndreMiras, I almost always skip these tests as well.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I also tested one of the [generated apks](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/actions/runs/67617605) for `on_device_unit_test_app`, the one for `arm64-v8a`, and it works ok, actually I think that it works better, since the kivy's keyboard features now I think that are working as expected.",
      "For what it's worth, `test_pythonpackage.py` tests with pip because pip has no stable interface and likes to break things, and there is no libpip or other library-level alternative. So this is kind of an external problem that cannot be easily solved unless pip decides to do so.\r\n\r\nEdit: the out of memory thing sounds strange though. How much did it have available to run?",
      "Got sidetracked on this but still trying to prioritise it over anything else.\r\n\r\nI fixed a bug with the sdl2 patching, on runs after the first one it was partially-applying the patch before deciding the patch wasn't needed, breaking the java code. I've made it do a dry run instead, which seems to resolve that issue.\r\n\r\nI want to do a bit more testing, but as far as I know it's working fine now.",
      "Fixed tox, I think, by fixing recipe cache clearing.",
      "Fixed another bug, in test_recipe.py. This one only occurs if you run the tests from an unexpected directory, as the test tries to listdir a directory that doesn't exist because the exists call has been overridden. To keep things simple, I changed the test state so that this directory is not in the search path, but I might revisit this in another PR."

Or is it something else?\r\nIf it's the case, then I think adding a note saying so should be enough.\r\nAlso we could add to clarify that all `p4a` commands are then available within this shell e.g `p4a apk --private ...`",
      "@AndreMiras \r\n\r\nYeah, you're right. One line of docker command won't be enough, often we need to get into the container to do more stuff to make things done.\r\n\r\nI use `yingshaoxo/kivy-diary` there is because when I write that tutorial, I suddenly realize that I couldn't make clear explanations without an existing compilable kivy repository. (I have to show them how to set the right Env variables and how to use p4a.) You guys could use your own if you have one. It's not a problem.\r\n\r\nThe initial purpose for me to write that tutorial is :\r\n\r\n1. I think the traditional way of installation for compiling kivy app is too complicate to make. A simple point would be you have to install JDK-8 to use p4a. But it's out of date. And it definitely would conflict with modern software in Linux. The only reasonable way for compiling kivy is to use Docker.\r\n\r\n2. For those people in China, they're facing a big problem from the GFW. So it can be very difficult for them to install the whole SDK and NDK within the docker image. Meanwhile, the docker container is cheap, it can be messed up or destroyed easily. That's why local SDK and NDK with Android Studio matters.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I'm just a contributor, I do want I can to make things simpler, as for whether you take it, it depends on you. But if Python wants to exceed from the competition of JavaScript, it must be a more friendly cross-platfrom programming language."

I made this to make it work [mplfinance](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance), a kind of `matplotlib`'s extension.

Also I was forced to create a [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) recipe...this one is interesting right?\r\n\r\nAnyway, If you guys find this interesting, I will create separate PRs...so give me your thoughts about this:\r\n\r\n   - should we include libraries: `bz2` and `lzma`?\r\n   - should we enable the built of some extra python modules: `_bz2.cpython-38.so` and `_lzma.cpython-38.so` (depends on previous steps)?\r\n   - should we add a `pandas` recipe (depends on previous steps)?\r\n   - should we introduce `mplfinance` recipe (again...depends on previous steps)?\r\n\r\nI think that the first three points are worth it...the last one probably too (it doesn't seem hard to maintain).",

      "More thoughts:\r\n  - Successfully built all archs for `matplotlib` recipe (without `harfbuzz`) :smile:\r\n  - MacOs build with `travis` is still failing (of course...nothing made to change that)\r\n  - Yeah, `rebuild_updated_recipes` has no problem now with `matplotlib` recipe :tada:. BTW, if you look to the commit I made eb5e35a , you will see that the `matplotlib` recipe has hardcoded version for `freetype` library, and for `png` as well. That is not ideal and we probably want to get the version dynamically...anyway doesn't seem to affect the `matplotlib` compilation/installation....I suppose that `matplotlib` build only checks for a minimal version...still...before the merging of #2076, I'm planning to do a couple more of commits to address these things :wink:\r\n  -  I cannot test, at runtime,  [the generated apks](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/actions/runs/48432064) for `x86` and `x86_64`...will work at runtime? :no_mouth:",
      "Ok, we have `matplotlib` recipe merged into `develop` branch, with the issues mentioned before already fixed in there. BTW, thanks for the fast review @AndreMiras :+1: :)\r\n\r\nSo now I want to do one last test in here, the `numpy` update #2077, because `matplotlib` recipe depends on it...so better not to broke that, right? So...let's continue the investigation :mag_right:",
      "Yeah, The new `numpy` recipe plays nice with the matpltolib recipe for `armeabi-v7a` and `arm64-v8a` ([Here are the generated apks](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/actions/runs/50161192))\r\n\r\nBTW, the error we got are [the expected ones](https://travis-ci.org/github/kivy/python-for-android/builds/658715939?utm_medium=notification&utm_source=github_status):\r\n  - MacOsX test app build fails for `travis`\r\n  - Python2 fails because the new `numpy` recipe is not compatible with it.\r\n\r\n**So, as a conclusion for the `numpy` test:**\r\nThe new `numpy` recipe is not compatible with `python2`. Given that [python2 will not be maintained anymore](https://pythonclock.org/), and the fact that we have the `numpy` recipe posted and approved without merging for several days without anyone complaining, I think that the show must go on, so let's merge `numpy` into `develop` branch :smile:",
      "The issue is still persistent as I faced it while building for armeabi-v7a & arm64-v8a android arch using buildozer, which is as the results are also crossed in checks link of the post.\r\nI m using python==3.8.2, buildozer==1.2.0.dev0, kivy==2.0.0 on MacOS==11.3.1\r\n\r\nIs their any work around for mentioned arch till?"

This file will allow us to test these recipes via our unittests. Just noting that the recipes we want to test, must be explicitly mentioned. Also should be mentioned that this feature its only available for **direct build with p4a** (when `setup_test_app.py` is ran)...so **buildozer builds will build an basic test app**, no matter what recipes are introduced into `buildozer.spec` file, because the  `app_requirements.txt` will only be created if the `setup_test_app.py` file is ran.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n  - @inclement, I included you as author of this thing (alongside myself), I think that we are the authors of the removed test apps and you are also the author of the base code for the `on device unit test app` (@AndreMiras and *anyone looking into this*, I think that you are not involved with these test apps, please, let me know if I'm mistaken and I will include you as author as well).\r\n  - I avoided python3's specific code in purpose, so the new test app could be also run from python2 (this way we can remove the python2 test apps). BTW, we only have one `import` to add python2 compatibility to this new unit test app...imho...I thinks it's worth it :wink:\r\n  - I labeled this `WIP` because:\r\n    + I want to add a couple of commits, in order to force to generate the flask testapp via gh-actions and restore it to kivy, so this way, you guys can see the result of this `flask unittest testapp` without building anything, for now you can download the `kivy testapp` at gh-actions\r\n    + I have mixed feelings about this PR...maybe the whole thing it's a crazy idea of mine...mmmm...let me know if this is the case and I will close this, no problem at all\r\n  - I added a font file (it's very light...less than 10Kb and it's  [free for commercial/personal use](https://www.wfonts.com/font/blanka)). This font has two purposes:\r\n    + used for some titles in kivy/flask apps\r\n    + to perform the unittests for the Pillow recipe\r\n  - @inclement, the testapp for keyboard that I deleted and included at the new unit test app...I'm not sure if its working as expected...it would be great that you could download one of the generated tests apps via gh-actions and give your thoughts, @AndreMiras, it would be awesome to have yours as well.\r\n  - I did not test the `buildozer` build, anyone could test it?\r\n  - Closes #2073\r\n\r\n**Some future improvements we could make:**\r\n  - remove/integrate some more test apps.

I leave this **WIP** awaiting your review (@AndreMiras...and yours again if you want) you probably want to change something, so let me know or make the changes that you want directly in here (you should be able to do so, because I always mark the checkbox *allow edit from maintainers*), whatever it's fine to me.\r\n\r\nAlso, here you have the download links for the generated apks via gh-actions (you can collect yourself this via the artifacts dropdown of the gh-actions corresponding job, but I collected the relevant ones for you guys :wink:):\r\n  - [Flask apk (python3 - arm64-v8a)](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/suites/377778226/artifacts/875781) (collected from commit 0ed4d70)\r\n  - [Flask apk (python3 - armeabi-v7a)](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/suites/377778226/artifacts/875782) (collected from commit 0ed4d70)\r\n  - [kivy apk (python3 - arm64-v8a)](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/suites/386781165/artifacts/973343) (collected from the last gh-actions job, 896c819) \r\n  - [kivy apk (python3 - armeabi-v7a)](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/suites/386781165/artifacts/973344) (collected from the last gh-actions job, 896c819)\r\n\r\n**Note:** Since I consider this very useful for us (specially in combination with gh-actions) and I don't want to rush you with the review, I'm planning to open a draft pull request with this branch `squashed and merged` on top of develop branch , so I can play a little with the requirements of the `on device unit test app`, just to test some recipes which I know that are not working (and I will try to fix it  there), so we all can see this thing in action and maybe extract some fixes for the non working recipes.\r\n\r\nA quick \"run in desktop\" tutorial\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nIf you just want to see how it will look the kivy/flask apps from your PC, you can run the main.py file with the proper python environment/installation. If you don't make any build nor touch `setup_test_app.py`, then the kivy app should run (of course you need kivy installed), if you edit the mentioned file replacing kivy for flask in requirements (setup_test_app.py or via cli) and make a build as we used to do with the removed `setup_testapp_python3_sqlite_openssl.py`, well...flask app should raise (you need flash installed and a browser to see the results)\r\n\r\n**Hack**: you can avoid do the build if you create the file `app_requirements.txt` file inside `testapps/on_device_unit_tests/test_app` folder with the requirements you want to test. The content of such file will look like as following (without touching `setup_test_app.py` and performing a build of an apk):\r\n```\r\nsqlite3\r\nlibffi\r\nopenssl\r\npyjnius\r\nkivy\r\npython3\r\nrequests\r\n```",
      "Ok, I fixed the merge conflicts and restored the `setup_testapp_python3_openssl_sqlite.py`. BTW...I also use it, but lately I began to use the  `on_device_unit_test_app` as a replacement because I find it more versatile since it does the same than `setup_testapp_python3_openssl_sqlite.py` but a little more :smile:. Anyway, I have no problem on leaving it in the project, after all...it has been a lot of helpful to me :wink:"

Looks like the only test failure is now in travis on macOS, with the `error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/include/python3.8/pyconfig.h'` that I've seen other people mention before, presumably because the Travis builds are using 3.7. I've changed the travis.yml to use 3.8 to see if that works, but does anyone know why osx (and only osx) is using the system's Python.h in the build?",
      "Looks like 3.8 isn't available on macos with travis anyway, so updating the travis.yml doesn't do anything useful. Let's leave it at 3.7 for now, it's fine to run p4a under this version and we can sort out multi-version testing later if we want.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the question of what to do with the failing macos build.

The good thing of this is that we run the tox tests in MacOs, which make me notice that we had wrong some of our tests so we solve this in here.\r\n\r\n**Why introduce `gh-actions`?**\r\n\r\nWell, because it's one more asset that we can use, and this is only one small part of what can be achieved with `gh-actions`. IMHO, I think that we can benefit from `gh-actions`, I wouldn't remove travis tests at all, but I would use `gh-actions` for any operation that requires to use passwords, since it's more easy to deal than with travis.

Is that OK? Should recipes only refer to tarballs/tagged snapshots/releases, or is it allowed to have a moving target in there?\r\n\r\nIn general we'd like to tag specific versions, but for something like this it's reasonable to have a moving target. I think the obvious options are:\r\n\r\n* leave this as a PR until you feel some stable target is ready\r\n* merge with a recipe name like \"pygame2beta\" that will go away once a stable target is available\r\n* merge with the name \"pygame2\" and just assume nobody will use it much until it's stable\r\n\r\nI don't really mind which we do. I wouldn't normally like the last one, but good pygame support is a big target so it's reasonable to compromise for ease of use.",

      "Yes, this is strange, why would setuptools not be installed? FYI,  I managed to build my app on travis using the proposed recipe change:\r\n\r\n - [`buildozer.spec`](https://github.com/joergbrech/mapfix/blob/master/buildozer.spec)\r\n - [pyproj recipe](https://github.com/joergbrech/mapfix/blob/master/custom_p4a_recipes/pyproj/__init__.py)\r\n - I had to use [this p4a version](https://github.com/joergbrech/python-for-android/tree/mapfix-workaround. This is unrelated to the buildprocess, it just excludes a commit that does not work with the latest buildozer version yet (Renaming of the per-arch-build directories). I couldn't use the master branch because I get link errors with android NDK 17c.\r\n - [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/joergbrech/mapfix/blob/master/.travis.yml)\r\n - [travis

It also fully leverages the docker image cache.\r\nThe newly built image is pushed to be available for subsequent build\r\nstages and pull requests.\r\nTwo environment variables `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` got\r\nadded to the Travis UI for making image pushing possible. Both `push`\r\nand `pull` features fail silently with `|| true` as they should be\r\noptional for a valid build.\r\n`TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST` and `TRAVIS_BRANCH` are built-in Travis variables.\r\nNote that we're passing variables to `Makefile` explicitly on `make`\r\ncall rather than using the `--environment-overrides` flag. While it's\r\nmore verbose, it makes it easier to follow what's being used and when.\r\nWith this change, `Python 3 arm64-v8a` the longest `testapps` build that\r\nwas taking ~26 minutes to complete is now taking ~20 minutes when\r\nhitting docker layers cache (most of the time).

      "Release 2019.10.06 (#1998)\n\n* [recipes] Fix compilation for  regex recipe\r\n\r\nThe error was: build/other_builds/hostpython3/desktop/hostpython3/Include/Python.h:39:19: fatal error: crypt.h: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n* [recipes] Update regex's recipe\r\n\r\n* put the sdk manager command in a code block (#1956)\r\n\r\nto avoid quotes being replaced by fancy ones\r\n\r\n* Updated version number for develop branch following 2019.08.09 release (#1960)\r\n\r\n*  Fix build for case-insensitive FS and add CI test for OSX (#1951)\r\n\r\n* [python] Fix build for case-insensitive FS :apple:\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the generated python binary for some builds are named `python.exe` instead of `python`. This depends on the File System where the build happens. It will be named `python.exe` when the FS is case-insensitive (Mac OSX and Cygwin), but it will be named `python` when the FS is case-sensitive (most GNU Linux distributions). The proposed solution consists in make a copy of the generated python binary with a given name (python3 or python2) so this way\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal we refactor a little our `HostPythonRecipe`:\r\n¬† - add private property `HostPythonRecipe._exe_name` (the name of the python executable based on major version)\r\n¬† - add public property `HostPythonRecipe.python_exe` (the full path of the python executable)\r\n¬† - implement `HostPythonRecipe.should_build`\r\n\r\nAnd also it's affected the `GuestPythonRecipe`, because we need to use the generated python executable by `HostPythonRecipe`:\r\n¬† - add private property `GuestPythonRecipe._libpython` (python's library name with extension...hardcoded for now...)\r\n¬† - implement `GuestPythonRecipe.should_build`... to check the library instead of the executable so we avoid conflicts with case-insensitive FS\r\n\r\nWe also need:\r\n  - fix `PythonRecipe.real_hostpython_location` because the name of our host python executable will depend on major version\r\n¬† - fix python2 interpreter (fix-interpreter-version.patch)\r\n\r\nNote: the variation of the name of the python's executable is mentioned at python's build docs (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/README.rst#build-instructions)\r\n\r\nNote: @TheSin- , ¬°¬°¬°thanks for your debugging sessions!!!\r\n\r\n* [ci] Add Mac OSX CI's test & refactor android's NDK/SDK installation\r\n\r\nTo do so we:\r\n¬† - create a makefile to install the necessary dependencies for Mac OS X: `ci/makefiles/osx.mk`\r\n¬† - create a makefile to install android's SDK/NDK:¬†`ci/makefiles/android.mk`\r\n¬† - refactor docker files: make use of android's makefile\r\n  - change OS, from `linux` to `osx`, for CI test `Python 3 armeabi-v7a`, so we don't increase the overall build time and jobs\r\n¬† - rename the `Python 2` test to `Python 2 armeabi-v7a (with numpy)` to reflect the build arch and numpy's build.\r\n\r\n* customizability (#1869)\r\n\r\n* customizability options - added compile-options\r\n\r\n* apptheme option for all bootstraps\r\n\r\n* Initial migration to NDK r19 (Part I - The core) (#1722)\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Rework of the arch environment to work with ndk r19+\r\n\r\nThings done here:\r\n\r\n  - Modifies target so we can use the toolchains `in-place` (as if we were using a standalone toolchain)\r\n  - Removes some cflags that we don't need anymore\r\n  - Move `macros` and `includes` from `CFLAGS` to `CPPFLAGS` (because this is the way it's supposed to be)\r\n  - Move libraries from `LDFLAGS` to `LDLIBS` (again, the same as above)\r\n  - Refactor `Arch`'s variables into class attributes, to make `get_env` smaller and to be more readable/maintainable:\r\n    + class attributes for flags:\r\n      * common_cflags\r\n      * common_cppflags\r\n      * common_ldflags\r\n      * common_ldlibs\r\n      * common_ldshared\r\n      * arch_cflags\r\n    + class attributes for compiler:\r\n      * clang_path\r\n      * clang_exe\r\n      * clang_exe_cxx\r\n  - Remove hardcoded cpu count in `MAKE`\r\n  - Remove `gcc` of environment (because it has been partially removed in ndk r18)\r\n  - Shorten long line to be pep8 friendly (line where we define env['BUILDLIB_PATH'])\r\n  - Commented lines for `ArchAarch_64` that it seems tha we don't need anymore (not removed because I'm not sure if we need them)\r\n\r\nNote: This will force us to use a minimal ndk version of 19\r\n\r\nSee also: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/other_build_systems\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update `test_archs` to ndk's r19+ build system\r\n\r\nAlso add some more tests. Now we check if some of the functions we mock, `glob` and `find_executable`, are called with the expected arguments\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update `test_bootstrap` to ndk's r19+ build system\r\n\r\nBecause `clang` is the new default compiler and the affected tests were made thinking in `gcc` compiler\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Remove `clang` of `get_recipe_env`\r\n\r\nBecause as per ndk r19 the default compiler is clang and gcc has been partially removed\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Adapt python recipes to ndk's r19+ build system\r\n\r\nWe move python recipe to use a minimal ndk version of 19 because it will simplify the python's cross compilation (this way we can remove some environment variables that we don't need anymore). The only side effect detected is that the python's `zlib` module isn't built anymore. This is caused because python3 and python2 build systems contains libz's hardcoded version, which does not match the version used in ndk 19 (may be this the cause of some `zip/unzip` errors reported in python-for-android's issues?). We will take care later of this zlib problem, or we will get a runtime crash...so it seems that zlib is an `essential module` to successfully run a python-for-android app\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update libffi to version post `v3.3RC0`\r\n\r\nand adapt it to be ndk r19+ compatible\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix build of python's zlib module\r\n\r\nBecause python has a hardcoded zlib version which does not match android's ndk r19, and that prevents the build of zlib's module\r\n\r\nNote: it seems that we have to point to the right lib and headers, otherwise we won't succeed in building python's zlib module\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix build of python2's _ctypes module for ndk r19+\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix numpy for ndk r19+\r\n\r\nNote: because of the new build system recently introduced, we can safely remove some of the patches that we needed because it seems that it builds and runs fine without them\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update docs with the new ndk requirements\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Set min/max/recommended android's NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Make CI tests with android's NDK `r19b`\r\n\r\nBecause it's our minimum supported android NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix png recipe for NDK r19+\r\n\r\nWe remove `get_recipe_env` because we don't need anymore to specify the flags set in there.\r\n\r\nNote: As per new NDK r19+ build system implemented in p4a, the removed `flags` should be automatically set by the android's NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Add `-fPIC` to `armeabi-v7a`'s arch cflags...\r\n\r\n...force `Position-Independent Code`\r\n\r\nTo solve the kivy's build error detected in travis `OSX` test (https://travis-ci.org/kivy/python-for-android/jobs/576204088#L1105). But also detected the same error in  my local tests (linux os in this case) for `freetype` and `harfbuzz` recipes...so I have the feeling that this is better to set as global :crossed_fingers:..is it?\r\n\r\n* [LIBS - PART I] Initial refactor of library recipes (#1944)\r\n\r\nThis commit will introduce a new cls attribute: `built_libraries`.\r\nThis `built_libraries` attribute must be a dictionary. The keys are the full library name, e.g.: `libffi.so`. And the values must be the relative path of the library, e.g: `.libs`. So the this cls attribute for libffi recipe it would look like:\r\n    ```built_libraries = {'libffi.so': '.libs'}```\r\n\r\nThis new cls attribute will allow us to detect library recipes and to refactor common operations that we do for those kind of recipes:\r\n  - copy library into right location\r\n  - implement `should_build` for library recipes\r\n\r\nThose two things will make that our rebuilds to be more consistent and I hope that it will be easier to maintain. \r\n\r\n**So, once explained a little this PR, in here we do:**\r\n  - [x] Add attribute `built_libraries`\r\n  - [x] Add methods to refactor common library operations:\r\n    - [x] install_libraries\r\n    - [x] get_libraries\r\n  - [x] implement `should_build` for library recipes\r\n  - [x] implement basic tests for the newly introduced `Recipe` methods\r\n  - [x] Make use of those Library attributes/methods for some basic set of recipes:\r\n    - [x] libffi\r\n    - [x] openssl\r\n    - [x] png\r\n    - [x] jpeg\r\n    - [x] freetype\r\n    - [x] harfbuzz\r\n    - [x] libcurl\r\n    - [x] libzbar\r\n    - [x] libiconv\r\n    - [x] libexpat\r\n    - [x] libogg\r\n    - [x] libxml2\r\n    - [x] libxslt\r\n    - [x] libshine\r\n    - [x] libx264\r\n    - [x] libglob\r\n    - [x] libsodium\r\n    - [x] libsecp256k1\r\n\r\n**Things to do in separate PRs**, to be easy to review and because those points will start to conflict with the `NDK r19 migration` thing just merged:\r\n  - Make use of Library attributes/methods introduced in this PR for un covered library recipes in here. Here we have two situations:\r\n     - library recipes that depends on android's STL library (almost all the work done in here will depend of the `NDK r19 migration` thing)\r\n     - all remaining library recipes, which are not STL lib dependent and that are not implemented in here (because I was unable to perform a successful build with them using arch `arm64-v8a`...so I think it would  be better to deal with those recipes in separate PRs and later...with the `NDK r19 migration` thing merged)\r\n\r\n**Notes about changed recipes:** all the recipes touched in here almost have the same changes:\r\n  - remove `should_build` method (to make use of the one implemented in base class for library recipes)\r\n  - remove the copy of the library (because that will be done automatically by the method `install_libraries` implemented in base class)\r\n  - fixed the imports due to refactoring\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Add attribute Recipe.built_libraries\r\n\r\nso we can refactor some essential operations performed for library recipes (like copy the library into the right location, or decide if we should build the library recipe again)\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Add method Recipe.get_libraries\r\n\r\nThis function will allows us to get a list of the built/context libraries.\r\nThis will be useful to check if we have to built a library recipe or which library should be rebuild\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make `Recipe.should_build` decide the library build\r\n\r\nIn case that the attribute built_libraries has been set, we will check the need of the recipe build, otherwise we will act as usual, forcing the build unless overwrote in subclass\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Add method `Recipe.install_libraries`\r\n\r\nSo we can:\r\n  - control the copy of the library recipe\r\n  - refactor the install of the lib for all library recipes\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libffi a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make openssl a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make png a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make jpeg a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make freetype a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make harfbuzz a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libcurl a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libzbar a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libiconv a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libexpat a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso:\r\n  - make the imports from the right module\r\n  - remove hardcoded arch\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libogg a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libxml2 a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libxslt a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libshine a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso:\r\n  - make the imports from the right module\r\n  - remove the hardcoded cpu count when compiling\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libx264 a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso:\r\n¬† - make the imports from the right module\r\n¬† - remove the hardcoded cpu count when compiling\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libglob a library recipe\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libsodium a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso:\r\n¬† - make the imports from the right module\r\n¬† - fix hardcoded arch\r\n¬† - enable cpu count when compiling\r\n\r\n* [recipe-lib] Make libsecp256k1 a library recipe and ...\r\n\r\nalso make the imports from the right module\r\n\r\n* [tests] Add tests for library recipe\r\n\r\n* [NDK19] Fix libglob for android NDK r19\r\n\r\n- change the `ARG_MAX` define, because it's already defined at `sysroot/usr/include/linux/limits.h`\r\n- Replaced `size_t` by Including the <stddef.h> header.

      " Fix build for case-insensitive FS and add CI test for OSX (#1951)\n\n* [python] Fix build for case-insensitive FS :apple:\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the generated python binary for some builds are named `python.exe` instead of `python`. This depends on the File System where the build happens. It will be named `python.exe` when the FS is case-insensitive (Mac OSX and Cygwin), but it will be named `python` when the FS is case-sensitive (most GNU Linux distributions). The proposed solution consists in make a copy of the generated python binary with a given name (python3 or python2) so this way\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal we refactor a little our `HostPythonRecipe`:\r\n¬† - add private property `HostPythonRecipe._exe_name` (the name of the python executable based on major version)\r\n¬† - add public property `HostPythonRecipe.python_exe` (the full path of the python executable)\r\n¬† - implement `HostPythonRecipe.should_build`\r\n\r\nAnd also it's affected the `GuestPythonRecipe`, because we need to use the generated python executable by `HostPythonRecipe`:\r\n¬† - add private property `GuestPythonRecipe._libpython` (python's library name with extension...hardcoded for now...)\r\n¬† - implement `GuestPythonRecipe.should_build`... to check the library instead of the executable so we avoid conflicts with case-insensitive FS\r\n\r\nWe also need:\r\n  - fix `PythonRecipe.real_hostpython_location` because the name of our host python executable will depend on major version\r\n¬† - fix python2 interpreter (fix-interpreter-version.patch)\r\n\r\nNote: the variation of the name of the python's executable is mentioned at python's build docs (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/README.rst#build-instructions)\r\n\r\nNote: @TheSin- , ¬°¬°¬°thanks for your debugging sessions!!!\r\n\r\n* [ci] Add Mac OSX CI's test & refactor android's NDK/SDK installation\r\n\r\nTo do so we:\r\n¬† - create a makefile to install the necessary dependencies for Mac OS X: `ci/makefiles/osx.mk`\r\n¬† - create a makefile to install android's SDK/NDK:¬†`ci/makefiles/android.mk`\r\n¬† - refactor docker files: make use of android's makefile\r\n  - change OS, from `linux` to `osx`, for CI test `Python 3 armeabi-v7a`, so we don't increase the overall build time and jobs\r\n¬† - rename the `Python 2` test to `Python 2 armeabi-v7a (with numpy)` to reflect the build arch and numpy's build."

Be aware that if the `Lint` stage fails, then the `Test` stage will never be run. This feature has been implemented in here in order to only send the coverage reports in case that we succeed with `Lint` stage.\r\n\r\nThis is friendly with the idea to implement some kind of automation to auto release/publish p4a versions (see issue/discussion #1833). We could implement it in a new stage (eg: deploy), to build docs, release a new version when master branch is tagged, upload it to pypi....\r\n\r\n**As a side note:** notice that we currently perform our tox tests 4 times (one for each test we make)...with this pr we only make the tox tests one time (`Lint` stage), so this should improve the timings with our ci tests\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n  - I took myself the liberty to enable `coveralls` for python-for-android (not only for my fork, also enabled for the main project `kivy/python-for-android`, if this pr is not merged, then we should disable it)\r\n  - The added badge in README.md file should be automatically updated to the right value at the time of merging this in master branch\r\n  - The coverage is configured to only track the `pythonforandroid` module \r\n  - The coverage report is not totally accurate because we skip some tests in travis\r\n\r\n**Solves:**  #1788\r\n\r\n**Coverage report at:** https://coveralls.io/jobs/49254277",

This isn't in a mergeable state due to the changes it makes to other recipes and some parts that could be improved, but it's surprisingly close.\r\n\r\nThe necessary steps seem to be:\r\n- Build freetype as a shared library\r\n  - Probably matplotlib can include the static library somehow, but I couldn't work it out\r\n  - I disabled harfbuzz to make this easy, otherwise the .so file has a missing `hb_ft_...` symbol. Possibly this can be fixed by the three-stage build (freetype-without-harfbuzz then harfbuzz-with-freetype then freetype-with-harfbuzz) that you can read about online.\r\n- Build png as a shared library\r\n  - Again, was easier than making matplotlib include a static library\r\n- Set the matplotlib config properly\r\n  - Basically, don't build all the unnecessary gui stuff\r\n- Patch matplotlib for some final things\r\n  - Patch the numpy version to match p4a's - matplotlib downloads a numpy wheel to compile against, and it needs to match the version that the app will actually load. Could be improved by making the numpy version dynamic, or by just letting matplotlib link against a local numpy that p4a has built in the local env.\r\n  - Prevent TkAgg from being built, matplotlib seems to ignore the setup.cfg option for this. It has C++ compile issues that could probably be fixed, but aren't relevant since Tk won't work anyway.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested it widely, but the testapp seems fine with basic plotting:\r\n\r\n![mpl2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1265819/58130608-5512db00-7c14-11e9-8796-ae1dbe6b1f80.png)",

First an interface PermissionsCallback is defined, allowing PyJnius to be used to build a PythonJavaClass to match. This has a single method onRequestPermissionsResult with arguments which match that of the method on Activity. Instances of matching classes can be registered with PythonActivity using the new method addPermissionsCallback.\r\nFinally the method onRequestPermissionsResult is overridden on PythonActivity. This checks if a PermissionCallback has been added using addPermissionsCallback, and if so calls the onRequestPermissionsResult method of that callback, passing all the received arguments. The super method is then called.\r\n\r\nPython code in android.permissions then builds a PythonJavaClass to match the interface PermissionsCallback defined in PythonActivity. __init__ accepts a single argument, which should be a python function which will accept three arguments (which will be requestCode, permissions and grantResults). The function register_permissions_callback(callback) provides a simple routine to create an instance of this class, save it in the class itself (to avoid garbage collection) and register the callback function with PythonActivity.\r\n\r\nThe end user simply needs to create a Python function which will accept requestCode, permissions and grantResults as positional arguments, and then call android.permissions.register_permissions_callback(...) on that function prior to calling android.permissions.request_permissions(...).\r\n\r\nOne limitation is that if you call request_permissions using SDK_INT < 23, the callback will never happen, but if you do check_permission first (which will return True), and only request permissions if you need to, this will not happen.\r\n\r\nPlease note I don't know Java so this is potentially hideous code!",

(see below for details)\r\n\r\nAdvantages of `SDL_ANDROID_BLOCK_ON_PAUSE` set to `1`:\r\n\r\n- **avoids bad data loss in some situations.** example: my app has a save button, but because I coded it properly I keep the UI mostly responsive while saving, but because I'm also avoiding unnecessary threading this is all still going on on the main thread.\r\n\r\n   Result with the current `SDL_ANDROID_BLOCK_ON_PAUSE` set to `0`: if you press save then press the home button in like <500ms (which is a *common* user action) you are almost 99% guaranteed the save didn't actually go through for bigger documents, and now SDL2 will block the event loop making the UI update also block, and the entire save will block / *not finish*. Now if you wait long enough, you also have a really high risk the app will get unloaded without ever having saved, and you have *data loss.* -> very likely risk of save being completely lost if you tab out quick and then don't tab back in for a day or longer\r\n\r\n   With this pull request: very unlikely there will ever be an issue. The only remaining risk is that your app runs on a rather low spec phone so it will get instant-unloaded after going to background, or android crashes entirely. Both aren't really common.\r\n\r\n- **allows apps to do basic background stuff without services or threading.** this is self-explanatory. you can do things in the background without necessarily using complicated thread code, or even a service. of course the app may get terminated, but unless your app is a major resource hog you can assume to be able to do at least a few do low-risk background activities\r\n\r\nDisadvantages / risks:\r\n\r\n- **Naive/unaware frameworks will burn all batteries to death.** With this change, whatever is controlling the main loop (e.g. kivy, or the kivi app, or whatever other UI lib, ...) *must* do adaptive slowing down of the polling to something really slow like 500 milliseconds when in background. If not, this is almost guaranteed to be a major battery waster with a huge difference in battery impact of your app while in background\r\n\r\n- **May cause higher battery usage even if you're moderately smart about it(??)** This would actually be interesting to know. I'm not sure how bad a 500 milliseconds wakeup interval still is. I assume it has *some* remaining impact, but is it much? However, an app can always serialize state & use `sys.exit(0)` if that turned out to be a problem. So far, my app running with this hasn't shown up in the battery chart although I'm not sure if/how background apps are tracked. If anyone has more info here that'd be interesting to know\r\n\r\nThings to check:\r\n\r\n- **Kivy should be tested for race conditions.** This pull request can in theory expose race conditions. (since now you can get all sorts of events while in background rather than none because the event loop just hangs until the app gets focus again.) I tested with a non-kivy SDL2 app (using my own UI facilities) which worked fine, but obviously kivy should also be tested\r\n\r\n- **Kivy should slow down the event loop when in background.** if it doesn't do that already, of course. (or if kivy apps usually control the loop - I don't use kivy so I'm not sure about the API design here - then there will need to be a bigger announcement of this change, so that well-behaving apps implement this.)\r\n\r\n- **The docs for kivy should possibly get a recommendation to use `sys.exit()` when in background on android.** In a battery save chapter, there could be a note that after longer background idle it might be wise for an app to quit if it has truly nothing to do and it serializes its state properly. After all, for longer running tasks it should spawn a service anyway",

Now we check if some of the functions we mock, `glob` and `find_executable`, are called with the expected arguments\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update `test_bootstrap` to ndk's r19+ build system\r\n\r\nBecause `clang` is the new default compiler and the affected tests were made thinking in `gcc` compiler\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Remove `clang` of `get_recipe_env`\r\n\r\nBecause as per ndk r19 the default compiler is clang and gcc has been partially removed\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Adapt python recipes to ndk's r19+ build system\r\n\r\nWe move python recipe to use a minimal ndk version of 19 because it will simplify the python's cross compilation (this way we can remove some environment variables that we don't need anymore). The only side effect detected is that the python's `zlib` module isn't built anymore. This is caused because python3 and python2 build systems contains libz's hardcoded version, which does not match the version used in ndk 19 (may be this the cause of some `zip/unzip` errors reported in python-for-android's issues?). We will take care later of this zlib problem, or we will get a runtime crash...so it seems that zlib is an `essential module` to successfully run a python-for-android app\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update libffi to version post `v3.3RC0`\r\n\r\nand adapt it to be ndk r19+ compatible\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix build of python's zlib module\r\n\r\nBecause python has a hardcoded zlib version which does not match android's ndk r19, and that prevents the build of zlib's module\r\n\r\nNote: it seems that we have to point to the right lib and headers, otherwise we won't succeed in building python's zlib module\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix build of python2's _ctypes module for ndk r19+\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix numpy for ndk r19+\r\n\r\nNote: because of the new build system recently introduced, we can safely remove some of the patches that we needed because it seems that it builds and runs fine without them\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Update docs with the new ndk requirements\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Set min/max/recommended android's NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Make CI tests with android's NDK `r19b`\r\n\r\nBecause it's our minimum supported android NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Fix png recipe for NDK r19+\r\n\r\nWe remove `get_recipe_env` because we don't need anymore to specify the flags set in there.\r\n\r\nNote: As per new NDK r19+ build system implemented in p4a, the removed `flags` should be automatically set by the android's NDK\r\n\r\n* [ndk19] Add `-fPIC` to `armeabi-v7a`'s arch cflags...\r\n\r\n...force `Position-Independent Code`\r\n\r\nTo solve the kivy's build error detected in travis `OSX` test (https://travis-ci.org/kivy/python-for-android/jobs/576204088#L1105). But also detected the same error in  my local tests (linux os in this case) for `freetype` and `harfbuzz` recipes...so I have the feeling that this is better to set as global :crossed_fingers:..is it?"

If a `setup.py` is present in the `--private` code directory and `--use-setup-py` is set,\r\n    all dependencies that map to recipes will be implicitly added to `--requirements`\r\n2. After all modules in `--requirements` have been built, the `setup.py` is run (again only if\r\n   `--use-setup-py` was specified)\r\n\r\nThis has the following consequences:\r\n\r\n1. You can now use a `setup.py` and `--use-setup-py`, and either omit `--requirements`\r\n    (If you use Python 3) or otherwise just specify `--requirements=python2\r\n2. For projects without a `setup.py` file, *nothing changes*\r\n3. For projects that for some reason have a `setup.py` but don't want it to run for p4a, there will be a big fat warning printed that in the future, `--ignore-setup-py` must be specified (right now the default is still not to run the `setup.py` unless an explicit `--use-setup-py` was given)\r\n\r\n**Why this pull request is more than just a neat feature addition:**\r\n\r\nThis functionality solves fundamental issues in python-for-android::\r\n\r\n1. Currently, projects that need to be installed to work are a huge pain to get working. (They need to be copied to another place and then that folder needs to be added as an additional `--requirements` entry) This will no longer be needed\r\n2. `--requirements` is kind of annoying and violating DRY for projects that already use `setup.py` for desktop\r\n3. Currently, Cython projects that do cross-package `.pxd` imports are **impossible to install** without notable modifications to the packages themselves (e.g. manually copying the `.pxd` files around from one package into the other and set them up to be importable, which may not be much easier than fully merging the packages into one). This is because p4a assumes the install order of all the non-recipe dependencies doesn't matter, which is wrong for this case.\r\n\r\n    With this pull request, this won't be *fully* fixed: however, if the affected Cython libraries are regular enough or p4a-aware enough that they work without a special CythonRecipe (since basic Cython now works in p4a master without any recipe), then the project's `setup.py` can install them and proper install order will be preserved - so for these libraries, it will be fixed.",

But be aware that to achieve this we must modify a little our source code because as of python 3.5 the `.pyo extension` for compiled python files has been removed in favour of  `.pyc extension`, so it requires to modify `start.c` and `PythonActivity.java` files, which only contemplated the .pyo extension.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n  - the default behaviour will be to compile all python files to the corresponding compiled extension, so **this way the apk will run faster**\r\n  - also we compile the code with the option `-00` which will strip the docs, so we **will generate lighter apks**\r\n  - this change **affects** bootstraps: **sdl2, webview and service_only**\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n  - `PEP 488 -- Elimination of PYO files` (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0488/)\r\n  - `PEP 3147 -- PYC Repository Directories` as to why a separate directory is used (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147/)\r\n\r\nStatus: **I leave the `WIP` status because this may conflict with the sdl2 update by** @JonasT (#1528) and, probably, the merge conflicts will be aesier to solve here than in there, so...let @JonasT decide if we must remove the `WIP` status (be aware that this will also be an enhancement)\r\n\r\n**Thanks to @tito which make me notice that we had loose that feature**",

Also should be mentioned that if you make use of the python2legacy recipe, the openssl libs installed will be the old ones (version 1.0) because the new ones are incompatible with the old python. This add a complexity in our build system that we may want to remove very soon...but for now...it may allow us to make a softer transition between python2legacy to python3, first migrating all the recipes to be compatible with the new python2 build system so we can safely remove python2legacy, and  once we get in there...then we probably will slowly face out python2 support towards 2020 (the last planned release for python2)\r\n\r\n*Note for non sdl2 bootstraps*:\r\n  - **pygame bootstrap**: Contains a lot of hardcoded entries for the old python2 build, so it will not work until properly fixed in another pr. My intention here was to safe the pygame bootstrap using the python2legacy recipe...but we will see...because the python2legacy recipe may be removed soon and I'm not sure if we must maintain this pygame bootstrap because without the python2legacy recipe it may be difficult to make it work. \r\n  - **service_only bootstrap**: Again, hardcoded entries for python 2, but this is fixed in pr #1541 plus in that pr we will make it work for python3 too\r\n  - **webview bootstrap**: Again, hardcoded entries for python 2, but this is fixed in pr #1541 plus in that pr we will make it work for python3 too\r\n\r\n*Note for openssl affected recipes:*\r\n\r\nWell, the openssl update and the new python2 build system breaks most of the recipes that relies on openssl because most of them contains hardcoded entries of the old python2. All those affected recipes has been modified to work with the new python build system, plus we granted python3's compatibility to all of them in the corresponding prs:\r\n\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART IV] Fix cryptography+cffi (#1545)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART V] Fix pycrypto (#1546)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART VI] Fix scrypt (#1547)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART VII] Apsw for both versions of python (#1548)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART VIII] Netifaces for both versions of python (updates the netifaces version) (#1549)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART IX] Pymunk for both versions of python and enhance flags (#1550)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART X] Protobuf_cpp fixes and updated version (#1551)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART XI] M2crypto for both versions of python and updated version (#1552)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART XII] Pycryptodome for both versions of python (#1553)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART XIII] Pysha3 for both versions of python (#1554)\r\n  - [CORE UPDATE - PART XIV] Libtorrent+boost for both versions of python and updated versions (#1555)\r\n  - *[CORE UPDATE - PART XV] Add encryption test app (#1556)*\r\n\r\n*Note for graphical affected recipes*:\r\n  - **Pillow and pil needs to be updated** to work with new python build system. I already have done that (I mean fix the hardcoded entries and grant compatibility for both versions of python) but still not created the proper prs...because I touch some libraries needed by this recipes (libjpeg, png, freetype, harfbuzz) and still needs to review it and properly test. \r\n\r\n*Other recipes that may need touches*:\r\n  - I think that lxml was failing with all this changes (now I'm not sure about that)...anyway...also I had granted compatibility for both versions of python for lxml (Also I touch  libxml2 and lxslt). For this still not created prs... I need to review before push those changes...\r\n\r\n**Important note**\r\n\r\nThis pr needs one last fix, it may be some users that face the issues described in #1501, if that is the case, you can use a patch to solve this. Look at the **reverted** commit 99ee28b, extract a patch and apply it to your fork. We plan to fix it in #1568.\r\n\r\n**This has been tested with ndk r17c and also I made some builds using ndkr18b, but this last one needs more testing**\r\n\r\n*Development note: This pr was started in #1460 and also discussed in  #1534. Has been split in several prs to make easier to discuss and merge or discard all the initial work made in those prs*",

      "[CORE UPDATE - PART I] Refactor python recipes + openssl + sqlite3 (#1537)\n\n* Refactor hostpython3's recipe into a new base class HostPythonRecipe\r\n\r\nTo make it use as a base class for hostpython2 and hostpython3 recipes in a near future.\r\n\r\n* Refactor python3's recipe into a new base class GuestPythonRecipe\r\n\r\nTo make it use as a base class for python2 and python3 recipes in a near future.\r\n\r\n* Move hostpython2 and python2 recipes to a new name hostpython2legacy and python2legacy.\r\n\r\nThis recipes will be useless until properly fixed or maybe it will be removed...\r\n\r\n* Add the new hostpython2/python2 recipes (v2.7.15)\r\n\r\nThose new recipes will use the same build method than python3. Also added a set of patches, some of them are enabled by default because they are necessary to perform a successful build. The others are added because maybe we will need them.\r\n\r\n* Adapt sdl2's stuff to the new python2's build system\r\n\r\n* Adapt pythonforandroid's core files to the new python2's build system\r\n\r\nCause we share the same build system for python2 and python3 recipes, we can safely remove some specific python2's code in favour of the python3's code, otherwise we will surely find troubles in our builds.\r\n\r\n* Adapt python2's test apps to the new python2's build system\r\n\r\nThe python2's test with openssl and sqlite it will probably success, but without the libs until those are enabled. The pygame's test app will fail until properly fixed.\r\n\r\n* Enable sqlite support for python recipes\r\n\r\n* Add ability to compile recipes with clang\r\n\r\nThe android ndk has been migrated his default compiler from gcc to clang and soon will be removed from the ndk. Here we prepare p4a to compile recipes with clang, which will allow us to successfully compile an updated openssl libs. Without this openssl upgrade we will not be able to grant support to python3's _ssl.so module.\r\n\r\nNote: The default p4a compiler still is gcc...so...no changes on the compile behaviour unless explicitly requested\r\n\r\nReferences: #1478\r\n\r\n* Update OpenSSL to 1.1.1 (uses clang for compilation)\r\n\r\nThis openssl version is an LTS, supported until 11th September 2023.\r\n\r\nImportant: There is now a distinction between the version we use for downloading, and the version used for creating the library: OpenSSL 1.1 now have prefix with \"1.1.so\". This explains why others recipes that depends on it require the \"library\" version. Those recipes, still not are modified to support the new version.\r\n\r\nReferences: #1478\r\n\r\n* Enhance openssl recipe and remove lib_version\r\n\r\nSeveral actions done:\r\n  - The openssl recipe has been enhanced by introducing a couple of methods (include_flags and link_flags) which should help us to link other recipes with the openssl libs.\r\n  - Remove lib_version introduced in the last openssl version update, so we don't have to modify all dependant recipes\r\n  - Add a new variable `url_version`, used to download our recipe in the subclassed method versioned_url (this replaces the removed lib_version)\r\n  - Add D__ANDROID_API__ to the configure command (needed to successfully build the libraries and link them with python)\r\n  - Add documentation\r\n\r\n* Enable openssl support for python recipes\r\n\r\nThis commit grants openssl support for both python versions (2 and 3). The python2 recipe needs some extra work to make it link with python, we need to patch the setup.py file in order to that the python's build system recognises the libraries. This is not the case for the python3 recipe which works like a charm, except for the fact that we have to modify our static class variable ` config_args ` for the python's recipe, i found this to be necessary in my tests, otherwise the openssl libs aren't detected.\r\n\r\n* Fix hardcoded python2 entry for Arch\r\n\r\n* Fix hardcoded python2 entries for BootstrapNDKRecipes\r\n\r\n* Fix duplicated key in options for python2 test\r\n\r\n* Fix numpy's recipe and adds python3's compatibility.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n¬† - add numpy to CI tests for python3: this module is some kind of special and probably a dependency for a lot of python packages so better make sure that we not break anything...as we already do with python2\r\n¬† - Add numpy to python2 and python3 test apps, cause already have some buttons that allows to test it from the running app.\r\n\r\n* Add python3 test for sqlite and openssl and add python3's compatibility to dependant recipes\r\n\r\nTo be able to run successfully the new test we must add python3 compatibility to some recipes that is why we touch them here.\r\n\r\n* Make that travis test python3 with sqlite3 and openssl\r\n\r\n* Update android ndk to r17c for docker images\r\n\r\n* Add one more dependency to our docker images\r\n\r\nOr the ci tests where libffi is involved will fail.\r\n\r\n* Update documentation about the new python core\r\n\r\n* Prevent crash on create_python_bundle\r\n\r\nWhen building an apk for service_only's bootstrap the build will crash if we don't add some pure python packages, because the directory \"python-install/<distribution directory>\" will not be ever created, so...this will make p4a crash when we try to enter into this directory.\r\n\r\n* Replace exit for BuildInterruptingException\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @AndreMiras!!!\r\n\r\n* Remove note of quickstart.rst\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @inclement!!!\r\n\r\n* Redaction corrections\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @inclement!!!\r\n\r\n* Remove tuple of python versions\r\n\r\nBecause all 3 are automatically added by PythonRecipe.\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @inclement!!!\r\n\r\n* Replace backslashes\r\n\r\nTo be more readable and pythonic\r\n\r\nThanks @KeyWeeUsr!!!\r\n\r\n* Fix hardcoded toolchain version and arch for python recipe\r\n\r\n* Fix hardcoded toolchain version and arch for clang\r\n\r\n* Fix android host for python recipes\r\n\r\nTo allow us to build python 2 or 3 for any arch supported for p4a\r\n\r\n* Fix hardcoded target for python recipes and clang\r\n\r\n* Add missing includes for clang\r\n\r\nOr we will get errors complaining about missing includes related with asm\r\n\r\n* Fix hardcoded arch for numpy\r\n\r\n* Fix openssl build for arch x86_64\r\n\r\n* Fix openssl build for arch arm64-v8a\r\n\r\n* Drop commented code from python2legacy recipe\r\n\r\n* Replace backslashes for openssl recipe\r\n\r\nTo enhance the readability of the sourcecode\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks KeyWeeUsr!!!\r\n\r\n* Fix hardcoded arch flags for libffi recipe\r\n\r\nTo fix libffi build for any arch\r\n\r\n* Remove unneeded warning for numpy\r\n\r\n* Fix libffi build for all archs\r\n\r\nAdds some flags lost (removed when were fixed the hardcoded arch entries)\r\n\r\n* Remove lines from openssl recipe that seems not needed anymore\r\n\r\nThe removed code was intended to check if the library were build with the right symbols, and if not, clean the build and trigger a rebuild with a pause of 3 seconds (to show a message warning about the rebuild). It seems that new version of the openssl libs doesn't need this anymore because the symbols checked with the removed source code seems to be build without problems. So we remove those lines in order the clean up a little the code and to be reintroduced again if needed (but properly documented)\r\n\r\nReferences: #1537\r\n\r\n* Replace sum with append for cflags list\r\n\r\n* Remove unneeded message for build.py\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @inclement!!!\r\n\r\n* Remove commented line\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @inclement!!!\r\n\r\n* Remove unneeded files for the project\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @inclement!!!\r\n\r\n* Remove some unneeded lines for some of the test apps\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @AndreMiras!!!\r\n\r\n* Remove more unneeded lines for test app and shortens line\r\n\r\n* Fix initsite for python2's site module\r\n\r\n* Enhance python2 patches\r\n\r\n  - Move all locale related code from fix-locale.patch to fix-api-minor-than-21.patch, because for api >= 21 localeconv is properly defined in android\r\n  - Remove fix-locale.patch and the remaining code moved into new patches (and enhanced thanks to some cpython's patches I found in bug tracker), to be neatest\r\n  - Enhance definitions of fix-api-minor-than-21.patch to be more suitable for a potential upstream merge into cpython source (¬°¬°¬°Thanks @JonasT!!!)\r\n\r\nReferences: https://bugs.python.org/issue20306 and https://bugs.python.org/issue26863,\r\n\r\n* Remove unused patches\r\n\r\n* Some fixes/enhancements for python2legacy\r\n\r\nIn case we decide to make it work and maintain it\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @AndreMiras!!!\r\n\r\nNote: At this point the python2legacy recipe will not work, it would require some more work to make it successfully build:\r\n  - Fix conflicts between python recipes\r\n  - Add python2legacy compatibility to some basic recipes (For sdl2, at least we need: android, pyjnius, sdl2, setuptools and six)\r\n  - Add python2legacy compatibility to sdl2 bootstrap (at least)\r\n  - Add python2legacy compatibility to some core files (bootstrap.py, build.py and recipe.py)\r\n\r\n* Change ndk downloads page\r\n\r\nTo be safe for the foreseeable future\r\n\r\n¬°¬°¬°Thanks @inclement!!!\r\n\r\n* Fix clang path for crystax\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: fix conflicts between python recipes\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: provisional fix to the hardcoded job count\r\n\r\nThis should be implemented properly as described in #1558, but for now we will avoid issues\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: make work some basic recipes with python2legacy\r\n\r\nTo make it work the python2legacy recipe with the sdl2's bootstrap\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: make work sdl2 bootstrap with python2legacy\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: fix get_site_packages_dir for python2legacy\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: fix strip_libraries for python2legacy\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: make the necessary changes to recipe.py to make it work the python2legacy recipe\r\n\r\nNote: With this commit, we will be able to successfully build using the python2legacy recipe, but be aware that you may need to add python2legacy compatibility to some recipes to make it work with your app, because only some minimal set of recipes has been touched (the ones needed to make work the python2legacy with the sdl2 bootstrap and kivy)\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: make it work the openssl libs with python2legacy and python3crystax\r\n\r\nAlso this should fix the the openssl build issues reported when using crystax. Notice that this changes will leave us with two versions of openssl libs. We need the most updated one for our python2 and python3 recipes, and the legacy version for python2legacy and python3crystax. The python2legacy version is too old to support the openssl version 1.1+ and python3crystax is not building fine with the new openssl libs so to fix the crystax issues we force to use the legacy version, which previously has been proved to work.\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: add a test app for python2legacy (with openssl and sqlite3)\r\n\r\nTo make easier for us to test if python2legacy is working\r\n\r\n* Python2legacy: update README file\r\n\r\nTo inform about the python2legacy recipe\r\n\r\n* Move libraries from LDFLAGS to LIBS\r\n\r\nBecause this is how you are supposed to do it, you must use LDFLAGS for linker flags and LDLIBS (or the equivalent LOADLIBES) for the libraries\r\n\r\n* Fix linkage problems with python's versioned library\r\n\r\nThe Java method called to load the libraries only supports a .so suffix, so we must remove the version for our python libraries, or we will get linkage errors\r\n\r\nResolves: #1501\r\n\r\n* Revert \"Fix linkage problems with python's versioned library\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 99ee28b"

This breaks projects that have any `.pyx` files that are *not meant* to be built for the main build and break when Cythonized out of the blue\r\n2. it uses the wrong `site-packages` because it uses host python. This breaks `.pxd` cross-includes from any dependencies, since this requires proper site-packages during Cythonize (this affected me, see #1473 )\r\n3. it assumes the `setup.py` won't produce new `.pyx` files on its own. This breaks projects where that happens\r\n\r\n(Please note this pull request doesn't fix CythonRecipe in any way, it just makes it avoidable for Android-aware Cython projects)\r\n\r\n**Needs quite some testing, obviously!**",

Since it's in `start.c` it will apply to any sort of Python 3 used, no matter if it's Crystax or any other python install that lacks a properly patched `ctypes.util.find_library()` function.\r\n\r\nWhile this should probably be patched in the Python 3 itself in the long run, I suggest this fix is merged some time soon because:\r\n\r\n- it's available & works now (at least in my test it did)\r\n- it is rather local and can easily be removed once it is no longer necessary\r\n- even if applied on top of a working `ctypes.util.find_library()` function, it shouldn't render it inoperable\r\n\r\nFor my app, this worked perfectly fine and allowed me to get rid of ugly import order issues related to monkey patching this in the app code. It'd be very nice to have this finally fixed upstream.\r\n\r\nSee also ticket #1337",

This PR is a work in progress, I wouldn't usually make it anywhere near this early but I know people are following this closely so I thought I might as well be clear what is going on with it.\r\n\r\nRight now this is the most minimal possible implementation, I literally just got it working and there are many hacks to be resolved. However, it should work, the whole build process is now included although it's only tested on my machine so far there could be issues in other environments (especially macOS?). The main difference to the proof of concept is that I began moving the build into p4a's system rather than the shell/Makefile system used in Python bpo-30386. There's nothing wrong with that system, but since it isn't maintained it seems safer to make full use of p4a's tools instead. \r\n\r\nNon-exhaustive non-ordered list of things to do (note: even if checked off it doesn't mean the implementation is final, just that the bulk of the work is done on that feature):\r\n- [x] move Python bundling code from the bootstrap to the python recipes (makes more sense now that there are several)\r\n- [x] trim/strip the python3 bundle so that APKs are not too big (target: no bigger than python3crystax) [edit: done for now, got down to 11MB including Kivy etc., just by trimming out obvious stuff]\r\n- [x] move to use Python 3.7.0 instead of the bpo-30386 fork\r\n  - [x] and also check compatibility with 3.7.1\r\n- [x] add proper APP_PLATFORM setting functionality, including adding it to the build and dist folder disambiguation\r\n- [ ] ~~make the python3 recipe use p4a's arch system as much as possible, including making p4a understand clang toolchains~~ [edit: won't hold up merging for this, will make a new issue for it]\r\n- [x] get everything working with APIs 21 to 27+, ~~currently tested only with API 24 and there are definitely things that need doing to make everything work with 27+~~\r\n- [ ] ~~check why ctypes isn't building and fix it if it's simple (it should be, I think it works in bpo-30386)~~ [edit: won't hold up merging for this, will make a new issue for it]\r\n- [ ] ~~openssl recipe compatibility~~ [edit: won't hold up merging for this, will make a new issue for it]\r\n- [ ] ~~sqlite recipe compatibility~~ [edit: won't hold up merging for this, will make a new issue for it]**\r\n- [x] clean the code, resolving all TODOs and hacks that are not confined to the new recipe (which can be merged as a WIP that is known to need tidying)\r\n- [x] check that python2 and python3crystax builds still work\r\n  - [x] python2\r\n  - [x] python3crystax\r\n\r\nMinor note: as it stands this recipe doesn't support API lower than 21 due to Android limitations. There are some patches that exist to fix that, but I'm probably not going to look into that any time soon, so API 21 may effectively be the lowest supported API for this recipe.",

Nevertheless, controlling this via ``HAVE_CTERMID`` and ``HAVE_GETPWENT`` in ``pyconfig.h`` would be the cleaner solution. I just have no idea how to control this via autoconf/autoheader in python build.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** Added another patch to disable large file support when compiling python 2.

However, it *does* work, and I'll now move to fix up a proper version. Even in the worst case that these types of changes never get updated or land in Python, it's more than enough to support p4a in the foreseeable future, and already far more understandable than the old hacky Python 2 method.\r\n\r\nI also got this working with API 27 for good measure. This involved a few further hacks to the Python build, which aren't yet in this PR, but shouldn't be important for other recipes. As far as I can tell that worked okay, if I upload the APK to the Play store it doesn't give a warning about the API version so it seems happy with what I did. The important thing here is: the target SDK version must be 27 or higher, the compile SDK version may be lower than that (but doesn't really matter right now), the min SDK version must be at least 21 for this Python version (I think), and finally the NDK target version controlled by APP_PLATFORM must have a *low* value, ideally equal to the min SDK. This NDK setting is not currently controlled by python-for-android, which I now realise is an omission that probably led to a range of build issues for different people.\r\n\r\nI know various people have been interested in aspects of this, please let me know if you have any questions. I'll update this if I achieve anything interesting, and also fix up all the work to properly add the features.",

However, with `python2`, there are the following issues:\r\n\r\n- The existing recipe for `setuptools` provides an older version of `setuptools`, which is too old for Pillow. This can be circumvented by specifying `setuptools==40.0.0` when building an APK. I am not sure if it is possible to specify a minimum version for dependencies inside recipes.\r\n- There seems to be an issue with the `jpeg` recipe which requires `libcutils`.

    "body": "First, don't let the size of the PR scare you. Most of the changes are the additon for patches for hostpyhton2/python2. Also the addition of the sh module and the replacement of everything that used sh. The rest of the changes are quite small.\r\n\r\nOverall notes\r\n---------------\r\n* This only supports python2.\r\n* ant has issues with spaces in paths. Try to have everything in a place without spaces. As a result, the temp directory may fail to work if your user name has spaces. As a result I set my temp directory to msys' temp directory which is at  `C:\\msys64\\tmp` for me. See the example bashrc file for how to set temp variables. All of them need to be set because it's not clear which of the versions are used.\r\n* hostpython2 cannot be built when the path is too deep because of a max path issue. The solution is to build it in a temp directory which is close to the root and then move it to the expected location. This will happen automatically if you define `PY4A_BUILD_TEMPDIR` to point to a temp directory in the env.\r\n* I added patched and added `XCOMPILE_BUILD_PYTHONHOME` and `XCOMPILE_BUILD_PYTHONHOME_EXEC` to hospython2 (I used 2.7.12 btw, but target is still 2.7.3). When set they are read first thing and determine where python looks for python modules, and compiled python modules respectively. This is because otherwise the copying of hostpython didn't work very well as it looked for the modules in different places. This way we can set the exec version to the hostpython's path and the other one to the target python's path so it uses its modules. But this patch is only applied on msys for now.\r\n\r\nHow to maintain msys support\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n* I added a reduced version of the sh module at `pythonforandroid.sh`. It works like normal (didn't test on linux yet), however it doesn't support some of the more fancy things like piping or some `kwargs` which it ignores. You can see the accepted list in the file. E.g. `_tail=blah` will just be ignored.\r\n* So please always use `from pythonforandroid import sh`.\r\n* While the msys env is fully linux (e.g. `C:\\prog\\file` is stored as e.g. the env variable MYPATH as `/c/prog/file`), when a windows program is called it converts these paths to windows format and when bash is called it converts the env paths to linux style. \r\n\r\nThis generally makes things work. However, if you pass a path as a variable (e.g. `CFLAGS`) or save it to file (e.g. `local.properties`) or whatever it won't go through this conversion process. Also, not all variables seem to be converted (maybe just the path type ones). So when passing paths to e.g. configure, if you use `join`, it'll use a `\\` which will not be converted automatically to a `/` which means that the configure or makefile will have a backslash in it which will break it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, to be safe for paths being passed from python code we should always use this style `C:/prog/file` as this is understood both by linux and msys exes. There's a function called `mpath` in `pythonforandroid.utils` that will do this conversion. I had to add calls to that in many places. It's best to use this everywhere we pass args to e.g. configure or to the env which is not a normal path type variable. E.g. the `PATH` variable should not (not sure if it breaks it if it does) undergo this change as it should happen automatically when python calls bash. This part may have to happen to existing recipes if there are issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall guide, brief\r\n----------------------\r\n* Download [msys2 ](https://msys2.github.io/) 64-bit (32 bit will probably also work, but I only tested with 64 bit). Install it to a root drive, e.g. `C:\\msys64` (we'll assume this path for now).\r\n* **Very important**: msys comes with `msys`, `mingw64`, and `mingw32` installed at C:\\msys64. These executables start different environments using different compilers. For this we must run `mingw64`. The following assumes you run it using `mingw64.exe` which will launch a bash shell environment. You can read more about msys [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/Home/).\r\n* msys uses pacman for package management so update as described on that download page. You'll need quite a few packages for the build. After the update, at the end, is a list of all the packages I installed. I'm not sure if all of them are needed, but many of them are. So please install all until we figure out which are not needed. To install, save the list to a file and from bash run `pacman -S $(cat filename)`.\r\n*Next you'll need to set up the mingw64 environment to use python and its dependencies. We're using the normal windows python, nothing special. You need to add the python root as well as it's scripts folder to the path (see example at the end). You can do it using `export PATH=$PATH:...` or add it to the bashrc file.\r\n* Install `cython`, `virtualenv`, `python-for-android` with pip.\r\n* Install Android sdk, you can do it from android studio, which has a sdk manager and install the api level you want to use from there (I'm sorry to say @KeyWeeUsr but you'll need to get a new harddrive to fit all of these). Set the `ANDROIDSDK` variable to the install path as well as `ANDROIDAPI` to the api level.\r\n* Install ndk and set the `ANDROIDNDK` to its paths. Add `ANDROIDNDKVER` with the version as well to the environment variables.\r\n* Install ant and set `ANT_HOME` to it's path. Add `$ANT_HOME/bin` to the path.\r\n* Install the java jdk and add it's path to `JAVA_HOME`.\r\n\r\nAn environment variable can be set using `export NAME=value`, or to make it more permanent add it to the `.bashrc` file. That file can be found at ``. Here's how the end of mine looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/e/apache-ant-1.10.0/bin\r\nexport ANT_HOME=/e/apache-ant-1.10.0\r\nexport JAVA_HOME=\"/c/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_112\"\r\nexport ANDROIDSDK=\"/e/Android/sdk\"\r\nexport ANDROIDNDK=\"/e/Android/android-ndk-r13b\"\r\nexport ANDROIDAPI=\"22\"\r\nexport ANDROIDNDKVER=\"r13b\"\r\nexport PY4A_BUILD_TEMPDIR=\"/tmp\"\r\nexport temp=\"/tmp\"\r\nexport tmp=\"/tmp\"\r\nexport TMPDIR=\"/tmp\"\r\nexport TMP=\"/tmp\"\r\nexport TEMP=\"/tmp\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce all set, just run py4a like normal. E.g. my command was `time p4a apk --private /g/Python/py4a/code/testapp --package=org.matham.myapp --name \"mingw_win\" --version 1.1 --bootstrap=sdl2 --requirements=sdl2,pyjnius,kivy,python2 --storage-dir=/g/python/py4a/builds/storage --arch=armeabi-v7a 2>&1\r\n| tee log` and took 72 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nautoconf\r\nautomake-wrapper\r\nbash\r\nbash-completion\r\nbinutils\r\nbsdcpio\r\nbsdtar\r\nbzip2\r\ncatgets\r\nccache\r\ncoreutils\r\ncrypt\r\ncurl\r\ndash\r\ndoxygen\r\nfile\r\nfilesystem\r\nfindutils\r\nflex\r\ngawk\r\ngcc\r\ngcc-libs\r\ngit\r\nglib2\r\ngrep\r\ngzip\r\ninetutils\r\ninfo\r\nless\r\nlibevent-devel\r\nlibffi-devel\r\nlibgdbm-devel\r\nlibreadline-devel\r\nlibsqlite-devel\r\nlibtool\r\nlibunistring\r\nlibunistring-devel\r\nlndir\r\nmake\r\nmingw-w64-cross-binutils\r\nmingw-w64-cross-zlib\r\nmingw-w64-i686-gcc\r\nmingw-w64-i686-ncurses\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-ccache\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-gcc\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-gdbm\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-glib2\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-gtk2\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-gtkglext\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-libevent\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-libffi\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-libunistring\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-ncurses\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-openssl\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-readline\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-sqlite3\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-tcl\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-tk\r\nmingw-w64-x86_64-tklib\r\nmintty\r\nmsys2-keyring\r\nmsys2-launcher-git\r\nmsys2-runtime\r\nmsys2-runtime-devel\r\nnano\r\nncurses\r\nncurses-devel\r\npacman\r\npacman-mirrors\r\npactoys-git\r\npatch\r\npax-git\r\npkgfile\r\nrebase\r\nsed\r\ntar\r\ntcl\r\ntftp-hpa\r\ntime\r\ntmux-git\r\nttyrec\r\ntzcode\r\nunzip\r\nutil-linux\r\nwhich\r\n```",

Cause building as static libs maybe is not necessary for some recipes or bootstraps, I doubt so, if we need to add this libs into the final app,  I decide to add the ability to build as static or shared (if the new python2 recipe is used it will be build as static, unless the user uses the variable \"force_shared\" set to True, otherwise it will be build as shared as always has been).\n\n**Merge Note**: This could break the old python2 recipe...so, only should be merged if the Python 2.7.11 PR is accepted\n",

I'm not nearly good enough at examing make files to know what the difference between the produced .so files are. But crystax produces slightly smaller .so files, and uses make install rather than make build_libs.\n\nMaybe the recipe should ignore recompilation if  armeabi-v7a and throw a warning that ssl.py _will not work_ until such time that this bug is fixed.\n\nI could also make the openssl recipe use the crystax build script, but then it's hard to have proper bookeeping on what has been built, and what is missing :-/\nAdditionally I have no idea whether the crystax script produces openssl libs that will work on the phone, or whether they just serve to be linked against by the python compilation...\n\nNB: I had to implement a realpath function as `os.path.realpath` is buggy. maybe that func should go into utils...\n\nRegards\nEmil\n",

    "body": "## Python 2.7.11 & Updates\n\n[This is only for testing purposes, because, as pointed by @kived, it modifies a lot of stuff, so very soon it will be created some small PR's that will be easier to review and test, so... THIS PR IS NOT TO MERGE and it will be closed soon]\n\nThe new python2 recipe supports optional dependencies: sqlite3, openssl and libffi\n- Updates the sqlite3's version for pygame's bootstrap\n- Updates the jpeg's version for pygame's bootstrap\n- Updates the freetype's version for pygame's bootstrap\n- Updates the pil's version, adding freetype's support and solves jpeg's issues\n- Solves conflicts with the distributed android libraries (openssl, freetype, harfbuzz), the trick is to link against the static libraries instead of linking with the shared.\n- Fixes the pygame build (solves issue #687)\n- Solves PIL does not compile with freetype2 support (issue #413) \n- The sdl recipe has been modified to avoid error not finding python (patch applied at build time)\n\nImportant notes:\n- The last commits, changes the build for pygame bootstrap. The integrated libraries inside pygame bootstrap components,  jpeg, freetype and sqlite3, will not be used anymore... instead we will use the recipes from python-for-android because they are more updated, allow us to have more control, simplifies the code used in some recipes and also solves some issues related with the mentioned libraries.\n\nMy Build Specs:\n- Tested with my app (with a lot of dependencies), using pygame and sdl2 bootstraps\n- Android's NDK version: r10e-rc4\n- Api version: 14\n- Build System: Debian Stretch (amd64)\n\nThank to:\n- Many Thanks to users: @brussee and @kived for his comments to helped me to polish things and improve the code.\n- Also thanks to @dessant to encourage me to try to update from my previous pull request...actually it was quite easy starting from my previous python recipe (2.7.9).\n- Also thanks all the developers who make possible this great project\n\n-Update:\nAfter the latest commits and some testing, I can say that the PR for python-2.7.11 works as expected for pygame and sdl2 and it should compile and run for everyone (I hope so...)\n\nNote: Would like to mention that the issues that i found with sdl2 were caused by my old kivy's config file and some button calls triggered by \"on_press\" event (this two caused that i receive duplicated events for almost all events in my app). After modifying the  entry \"input\" for my kivy's config file and changing my calls \"on_press\" to \"on_release\"....all works as expected :))\n",

The resulting openssl libraries will be renamed to libsslx.so and libcryptox.so, in order  to avoid conflicts with the distributed android libs, so...all the recipes that depend on openssl shared  libraries must be linked differently (Instead of seting ldflags to \"-lcrypto -lssl\" we must use \"-lcryptox -lsslx\")\n- The libtorrent recipe has been modified to adapt to new openssl build (as described above)\n- The sdl recipe has been modified to avoid error not finding python (patch applied at build time)\n- The sqlite3's recipe is from user brussee, with a little modification, so all credits must go to him\n- It is recommended to run command \"python-for-android clean_all\" before changing python2's optional dependencies (sqlite3, openssl or libffi)...otherwise it is most likely to fail, because the patches are applied at python's build time\n- Apologies for my english\n",

It as mangling to either use pyo in priority, or fallback to py if pyo is not found.\n\nNote that if you declare a name \"S1\", the java service will be named \"ServiceS1\", and your name will be capitalized (to have a correct java classname)\n\nThey are declared to run as separated process from the application.

(In kivy, it's just the start, after that we load the app, widgets etc... it can take a long time)\n2. the second call is done (at least on kivy) after the first frame rendered.\n\nThe loading screen might be displayed more than needed (pure SDL2 game // very fast loading).

This means it is no longer subject to the dlopen limit.\n\nI added a `-j` option to distribute.sh which bypasses liblink and biglink in order to distribute the real `.so` extension modules. liblink is skipped by re-exporting `$LIBLINK` to provide the real linker, so no recipes need to be changed.\n\nThis should make it easier to debug issues with extension modules. Currently, a bad module can corrupt `libpymodules.so`, which means the only error provided will be `_event.so is too small to be an ELF executable`, regardless of which module caused the issue.\n",

As far as I can tell, it _does_ resolve the linked issue.\n\nWithout this pr, something doesn't work - the build_ext lines don't place object files where the biglink script can see them. I think the issue is that they recognise the pyx source files haven't changed and therefore don't rebuild the object files, whereas with this fix cython is always called and the files are always rebuilt.\n\nAs discussed with tito, maybe there is a better solution, but I'm not even completely sure what's going on and I couldn't track it down better than this.\n",

That would mean the older fix is now a bug, by repeating the touch offset and making touches be in the wrong place again!\n\nThis pull request reverts the original touch fix (now redundant), which seems to resolve the issue. I've tested it successfully, and @denspb confirms at https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/commit/bc4a45c848b95e90557693221a29c60a145fdf4d .
