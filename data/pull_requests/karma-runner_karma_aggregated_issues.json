Let's continue the conversation on this topic there.\r\n\r\nOn the other point that @devoto13 raises, about our current testing being sufficient in the environment combinations (Node.js versions and OSs), I partially disagree. I encountered that commitlint fails in windows currently, so contributors could not run it if working in that OS. We were not aware of this because we do not conduct linting in Windows currently. So I think adding the combinations is valuable. Also, addressing @mtrea 's comment about computing resources I think we are way below reaching the GitHub actions computing time we have. In regards to waiting for tests, we could parallelize the other combinations of tests.\r\n\r\nSo, if you both agree, I can repurpose this CL to only expand the environment combinations for our testing workflow and drop making BrowserStack mandatory for now.

    "body": "The problem was caused by a race condition in the client JS implementation. When the `restartOnFileChange` option is enabled, the server would send [two commands](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/b153355de7e05559d877a625c9b0c5d23a3548bd/lib/server.js#L377) to the browser: `stop` and `execute`. Both of these commands navigate the context. `stop` navigates to the blank page, while `execute` navigate to the `context.html` thus triggering a test run. The `execute` command would trigger the navigation synchronously, but the `stop` command would trigger it on the next event loop tick. As a result, if both commands arrive almost at the same time, their order is effectively reversed: first schedule new execution and then immediately stop it. The bug is resolved by handling both commands synchronously thus ensuring correct order.\r\n\r\nThe setTimeout() call in question was introduced in 15d80f4 to solve #27 and was retained over time. It's not completely clear why the timeout was added, but it does not seem to be relevant.\r\n\r\nWith `clearContext: true`, karma will reset the context and thus cancel any scheduled navigations as soon as the test framework has reported the `complete` event. As navigations are canceled they don't affect karma and thus karma does not care about them. It's true that the user may have a test with race conditions (e.g. missing `done` callback), but it is up to them to investigate and fix it.\r\n\r\nWith `clearContext: false`, the same logic applies, that karma does not care about navigations after `complete` event as long as they don't break karma itself. Here it gets a bit tricky:\r\n\r\n- Navigation within the same origin is undesired, but it doesn't break karma and the next execution can proceed normally.\r\n- Navigation to a different origin however is a problem as after such navigation the iframe becomes cross-origin and karma client will not be able to navigate it to the `context.html` or interact with it at all for that matter until the page reload (see [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/q/25098021/1377864)). This will break the watch mode, but IMO we can let it be given that the case is quite uncommon, the user will see the browser window displaying something unexpected and the error in the CLI output. The changes in this commit don't make this case any worse and it does not seem to be possible to prevent such problematic navigations with the current state of browsers per https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload:\r\n\r\n> To combat unwanted pop-ups, some browsers don't display prompts created in beforeunload event handlers unless the page has been interacted with. Moreover, some don't display them at all.\r\n\r\nFixes #3724",

See the source map spec:\nhttps://sourcemaps.info/spec.html.\n\nThe warning for generated code is especially bad when the majority of\nfile paths, and the actually relevant-portions in the stack are\nresolved properly. e.g.\n\nErrors initially look like this without the source mapping processing\nof Karma:\n\n(See PR description as commit lint does not allow for long stack\ntraces..)\n\nA helper function shows up in the stacktrace but has no original mapping as it is\npurely generated by TypeScript/ESbuild etc. The following warning is\nprinted and pollutes the test output while the remaining stack trace\npaths (as said before), have been remapped properly:\n\n```\nSourceMap position not found for trace: http://localhost:9877/base/angular_material/\n  src/material/select/testing/unit_tests_bundle_spec.js:26:26\n```\n\nThe resolved stacktrace looks like this after the transformation:\n\n(see PR description as commit lint does not allow for long stack traces\nhere..)\n\nMore details on the scenario here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/devversion/549d25915c2dc98a8896ba4408a1e27c."

The method used is a bit more robust than the wildcard searches used in the other project, and should be less prone to accidental catastrophic backtracking issues, but the main point of this is to reduce the breadth of dependencies to help avoid upstream attacks in the future.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is not possible for users to plug in their own function; the recommendation would be for people who need \"friendly\" names for a wide selection of browsers to use the `fullName` property instead and do their own parsing (e.g. via `ua-parser-js` if they wish).",

      "Why do we want to use headless browsers instead of xvfb?",
      "@jginsburgn I think xvfb was used mostly for historical reasons because Karma predates times when the headless mode was implemented by browsers.\r\n\r\nIt seems that xvfb requires [extra work](https://remarkablemark.org/blog/2020/12/12/headless-test-in-github-actions-workflow/) or [a third-party dependency](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gabrielbb-xvfb-action) to use it in GitHub Actions, so I decided to get rid of it altogether. Headless should work the same as headful for the purpose of running these tests and we test in multiple browsers in headful mode using BrowserStack anyways.",
      "How can we protect ourselves from malicious executions triggered by pushes and PRs?",
      "As it says in the PR description, secrets are not available to the builds run from forks (i.e. when somebody forks repo and sends a PR). So I don't think there is any security risk there. \r\n\r\nAs for the malicious pushes... Well, we should not give push access to the people we don't trust. But that's pretty much the same level of security as we used to have with Travis. I'm not sure how we can make it better without hurting the ability of collaborators to actually do work (e.g. run tests on BrowserStack to debug issues, etc).",

      "> BROWSER_STACK_USERNAME\r\n> BROWSER_STACK_ACCESS_KEY\r\n\r\nShouldn't we use [BROWSER_STACK_ACCESS_KEY](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/94cf15e8fa4420c8716998873b77f0c4f59b9e94/test/client/karma.conf.js#L1) instead?",

      "> I have deleted the Travis webhooks. Can you clarify what is missing for Travis?\r\n\r\nI'll open a new PR to confirm that Travis and AppVeyor are not triggered to see if that's enough or we need to do something else.\r\n\r\n**UPD** \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/karma-runner/karma/pull/3702\r\n\r\n<img width=\"859\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/823594/137316896-c12b605d-977b-4efb-82ee-6bb78d094789.png\">\r\n\r\nSo looks like Travis was still triggered for the branch. Maybe it's configured somewhere in the settings as a required check or something?\r\n\r\nAlso, Appveyor was run, so we need to disable it as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe https://remarkablemark.medium.com/remove-travis-ci-from-github-7ea674784897?\r\n\r\n> Shouldn't we use BROWSER_STACK_ACCESS_KEY instead?\r\n\r\nI don't understand. What exactly do you mean by this?\r\n\r\n> Where and how are these used?\r\n\r\nSuaceLabs tokens are used in the [integration tests](https://github.com/karma-runner/integration-tests), which are run by `npm run test:integration`.\r\n\r\n> Just to confirm, this is only used in the \"Release\" workflow by the npm run semantic-release step, right?\r\n\r\nThat's correct.\r\n\r\n> I think this is not needed :)\r\n\r\nThat's actually used by [update-docs.js](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/tools/update-docs.js) to update [documenation](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-runner.github.com) when release is cut. I would suggest putting the same token as we have in Travis to secrets as it should have push access to the documentation website repo. Or alternatively, we can generate a new token specifically for that repo and store it under a different name (`DOCS_GITHUB_TOKEN` or something). Let me know if you would prefer the second solution?",

    "body": "So the symptom is that after Karma page is loaded in IE9 the tests don't run and Karma is stuck at the \"starting\" step. Reloading the page once or twice makes IE9 connect to the server and tests pass successfully.\r\n\r\nAfter an \"exciting\" debugging session I figured out that the problem is that on the first load (and sometimes after the page reload) [`io` variable](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/026fff870913fb6cd2858dd962935dc74c92b725/client/main.js#L14), which should be set by the `socket.io.js` script is undefined. It looks like IE9 silently stops executing `socket.io.js` script somewhere midway and switches to the next script causing the `io` variable to be undefined. I assume it hits some limit or threshold or whatnot. Couldn't find much information on the Internet, besides people experiencing similar issues when loading e.g. unminified jQuery and their own code firing before the `$` variable is available.

      "How did you debug IE?",
      "@jginsburgn I logged in to the https://browserstack.com used by Karma, got my user name and access key under ACCESS KEY. Then I added something like below at the top of the `test/client/karma.conf.js` file and commented out all launchers except the one I want to debug:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprocess.env.TRAVIS = '1'\r\nprocess.env.BROWSER_STACK_USERNAME = 'foo'\r\nprocess.env.BROWSER_STACK_ACCESS_KEY = 'bar'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I ran `npm run test:client` as usual, went back to https://browserstack.com, and found my running job. There is a Start interactive session or something button there, which allows you to tap into a VM, open IE's developer tools and look into what is going on.",

      "fix: fix running tests in IE9 (#3668)\n\nSo the symptom is that after Karma page is loaded in IE9 the tests don't run and Karma is stuck at the \"starting\" step. Reloading the page once or twice makes IE9 connect to the server and tests pass successfully.\r\n\r\nAfter an \"exciting\" debugging session I figured out that the problem is that on the first load (and sometimes after the page reload) [`io` variable](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/026fff870913fb6cd2858dd962935dc74c92b725/client/main.js#L14), which should be set by the `socket.io.js` script is undefined. It looks like IE9 silently stops executing `socket.io.js` script somewhere midway and switches to the next script causing the `io` variable to be undefined. I assume it hits some limit or threshold or whatnot. Couldn't find much information on the Internet, besides people experiencing similar issues when loading e.g. unminified jQuery and their own code firing before the `$` variable is available. No good solutions found.\r\n\r\nChecking the `socket.io.js` contents, I have noticed that v2 served the minified client script on that path, while v3 now serves the unminified code.

For Karma's programmatic users the change is backward compatible, but the current behavior of `parseConfig()`, `Server`, `runner`, and `stopper` is deprecated and will change in the next major release.

Hence we restore the provider and print a deprecation warning to make upgrading easier. This should give more time for the plugin authors to release new versions and users to adopt these versions."

      "I don't think this is a good change.\r\n\r\nIt results in worse developer experience. Compare \"My tests crashed. I check Karma logs and understand why. I see message explaining that my files have incorrect type.\" before vs. \"My tests silently passed, but some of them were not run and I didn't noticed as I never checked Karma logs.\" with this change. So when users upgrade to Karma 6, some tests may stop running, but it is hard to notice (in particular in CI environment, where it will be just a line in logs, not a failed test run). And for other part of users tests will start crashing because of missing files for no good reason creating annoyance.\r\n\r\nIf we want to make something in this area it should probably happen up the stack (during config validation or when we create `File` objects) and be first rolled out as a warning mentioning that this warning will become a hard error in the next major release (so people have time to adapt) and then in the next major release actually throw a hard error, which will prevent Karma from running.",
      "Ah, so your theory is that some of the incorrect file types are actually things needed for tests to pass?\r\nI think they are eg .wav files.",
      "How will a warning in the config file differ from the warning now?  Yes, it is better to validate in the config file analysis phase, but will users pay any more attention? \r\n\r\nSeems like the other option is to fail these cases outright: you have to pass correct file name or correct file types.  Is there a use case for the current silently-treat-as-js ? ",
      "> Ah, so your theory is that some of the incorrect file types are actually things needed for tests to pass?\r\nI think they are eg .wav files.\r\n\r\nYeah, exactly! I would expect some people to just ignore the warning right now as it's just a warning and rely on the fallback to JS. I can think of case like `myfile.cjs`, `myfile.mjs` or some extension-less URL where fallback works fine.\r\n\r\n> How will a warning in the config file differ from the warning now? Yes, it is better to validate in the config file analysis phase, but will users pay any more attention?\r\n>\r\n> Seems like the other option is to fail these cases outright: you have to pass correct file name or correct file types.\r\n\r\nI agree that this feature will also catch valid errors as you say (e.g. .wav, .jpg, etc) and it is useful to notify user about such cases. But I think that we should be loud about such cases and fail (not just print into logs). So, yeah, I'm for failing outright with the transition period to not affect existing users relying on the fallback.\r\n\r\n> Is there a use case for the current silently-treat-as-js ?\r\n\r\nSee above for .cjs, .mjs, extension-less URLs (for example https://unpkg.com/jquery will redirect to the JS file, but it does not have .js in the URL). IMO it is reasonable to ask users to specify `type` explicitly for them. Just need to communicate it clearly."

      "@johnjbarton It's just a last minute thought that crossed my mind after I have finished the implementation. \r\n\r\nMaybe it is better to remove `contributors` field from the `package.json` instead of implementing a plugin to keep it up to date? So an alternative to this PR is to remove `contributors` from the `package.json` and set [`author` field](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/package.json#L24) to something like: `Karma contributors (https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/graphs/contributors)`. I wonder what do you think about this alternative approach?\r\n\r\nI've checked couple of popular projects from my project's dependencies and discovered that they don't have `contributors` field in their `package.json`, but rather say in the `author` field that it was developed by contributors instead of a single person.\r\n\r\n",

When upgrading to karma v5 we faced some issues mainly on Windows. It turned out that the root cause is `EMFILE, too many open files`, probably because internal timings have changed by switching from bluebird to native Promises.\r\nAs the actual error hasn't been logged, it took me some time to find out where the error comes from.\r\n\r\nWe solved the problem on our side by starting the server as part of an async framework plugin, instead of just `require`ing it from the `karma.conf.js` (see https://github.com/SAP/openui5/commit/e77a49a64d3fed1da65689b1f8eb1674297f6602). This ensures that it doesn't get executed while karma is preprocessing all the project files. IMO it's anyway a better approach as it is ensured that the server is up and running before karma starts.\r\n",

      "chore(test): fix flaky test cases (#3314)\n\n* fix(test): fixed flaky reconnecting test\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/karma-runner/karma/commit/cc2eff27deb680f789afb34577fd337d2ad5dcac introduced different behavior depending on whether socket reconnected or browser reconnected after reload. This lead to the reconnecting test being flaky as, depending on the timing, it will trigger second test run and result in unexpected output.\r\n\r\n* fix(test): remove broken monitor action for Cucumber\r\n\r\nThe issue is that it resulted in the following sequence of actions:\r\n- run karma start\r\n- run karma run\r\n- and then instantly kill karma start command\r\n\r\nThis resulted in flaky tests because the kill could race, resulting in\r\nincomplete output. In fact test was unnecessary complicated as it was\r\nenough to use runOut, which asserts output of the karma run command.\r\n\r\n* fix(test): guard from repeated executions of the karma run\r\n\r\n'data' event handler may be called multiple times, which will result in\r\nmultiple calls to karma run. To take it even further, its execution is\r\ndelayed by setTimeout, which means that subsequent executions will run\r\nwhile next test scenario is in progress and may mess it up. To prevent\r\nthis make sure that karma run is executed only once independently of how\r\nmany time 'data' event is fired."

The client then later loads the iframe that embeds this context.html.\r\n\r\nIn #2542, I introduced a third option to run tests on lightweight browsers without iframe support. This is achieved by running test within the parent page and dynamically load all the files. I created a client_with_context.html which combines both client.html and context.html. The Karma middleware will concatenate all the included file paths, turns it to a long string with ',' separator and replace it with %SCRIPT_URL_ARRAY% in client_with_context.html. On the client side, it will read the %SCRIPT_URL_ARRAY% string and dynamically load the file one by one by creating script element. This is where the bug is introduced because I assume that all the included files are javascript, which actually covers most of the use cases in Karma.\r\n\r\nRecently, we would like to run Karma for UI testing using a screenshot plugin and we see css files are actually not properly loaded. In this fix, instead of passing the files paths to client, we are passing the HTML element in string. The client reads the HTML in string and created the corresponding html element using DOMParser() and then it is appended to the DOM dynamically.\r\n\r\nWhen I try out this new approach, one of the issue I see is script elements generated by DOMParser don't execute. Therefore, we have to use document.createElement for script elements.\r\n",

The change to `useragent` was intentional, and the maintainer advises upstream consumers to update tests to reflect the change.\r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/3rd-Eden/useragent/issues/120 , there is an open question to change the stringified OS to not include `0` for missing version numbers. For example:\r\n```\r\nfamily: 'Windows'\r\nmajor: 'Vista'\r\nminor:\r\npatch:\r\npatch_minor:\r\n```\r\nwould display as `\"Windows Vista\"` instead of `\"Windows Vista.0.0\"`.\r\n\r\nThat open question not withstanding, this commit is an incremental improvement: You can now see both Chrome Headless version and Windows version information in your console output. In general, `useragent` [consumers that perform `int()` conversions on `'major'`](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/issues/351#issue-368103777) should be aware.\r\n\r\nFixes #2762\r\n",

    "body": "Bump useragent to `2.3.0` to pull in ua-parser/uap-core#263 in which Headless Chrome version detected to be `0.0.0`.\r\nUpdate tests to reflect latest `useragent` OS major version string identifiers.\r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/pull/286 , `useragent` purposely sets the Windows Vista `family` to `Windows` and `major` version to `Vista`. The change to `useragent` was intentional, and the maintainer advises upstream consumers to update tests to reflect the change.\r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/3rd-Eden/useragent/issues/120 , there is an open question to change the stringified OS to not include `0` for missing version numbers. For example:\r\n```\r\nfamily: 'Windows'\r\nmajor: 'Vista'\r\nminor:\r\npatch:\r\npatch_minor:\r\n```\r\nwould display as `\"Windows Vista\"` instead of `\"Windows Vista.0.0\"`.\r\n\r\nThat open question not withstanding, this commit is an incremental improvement: You can now see both Chrome Headless version and Windows version information in your console output. In general, `useragent` [consumers that perform `int()` conversions on `'major'`](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/issues/351#issue-368103777) should be aware.\r\n\r\nFixes #2762\r\n",

    "body": "This change allows preprocessors to specify an encoding for files. Currently, if a preprocessor encodes a file in a format such as gzip or Brotli, the file is served with the wrong encoding. The only workaround for this is to also include a plugin ([example](https://github.com/GreenGremlin/karma-gzip/blob/master/lib/Plugin.js)) that removes encoded files from `files.served` and serves them manually using a custom file handler. This approach is a gross hack that unnecessarily complicates the encoding plugin's logic.\r\n\r\nWith this change, a preprocessor encodes the contents and stores them in the File class' new `encodings` property. The `encodings` property is a keyed object where the keys are the encoding type ('gzip', 'compress', 'br', etc.) and the values are the encoded content. This pattern has the advantage of allowing multiple encoders and serving the encoding that best matches the request. It also allows the unencoded content to be served, when no encoding matches the request.\r\n\r\nI know there has been [pushback on adding encoding support](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/1241), but I'm hoping this approach is an acceptable compromise. This solution leaves pretty much all encoding logic to the preprocessors and minimizes karma's role as much as possible.",

    "body": "# Problem description\r\n\r\nIf Karma receives an error during the load of one of the plugins it currently swallows that error and continues running other plugins and exits with a zero error code.\r\n\r\nI discovered this by investigating a successful build that didn't run any test on CircleCI. Turns out CI servers need a non-zero exit code to mark a build as failed.\r\n\r\nWebpack 1.0 had a similar issue and they introduced a bail option that is turned on by default in 2.0 with a workaround npm package for 1.0 called [webpack-fail-plugin](https://github.com/TiddoLangerak/webpack-fail-plugin). It would catch errors in plugins like babel that are used to compile the assets. A syntax error in the source code would cause babel plugin to fail and webpack would swallow the exception unless the bail option is on or fail plugin is present. See: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/708\r\n\r\nIn the case of Karma the failure was in the PhantomJS npm package, where it could not locate the binary. It should have been a show stopper and reported a failure, but proceeded to load and execute the next plugins. See: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-phantomjs-launcher/issues/120\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at looking at Karma, so please forgive my ignorance. This PR is a suggested solution and will need adjustments with your help.\r\n\r\n# Outstanding questions:\r\n\r\n1. Should we fail by default?\r\n2. Should we also introduce a bail option that is on by default? Or perhaps use another option?\r\n3. Is this the right place to handle errors like this?\r\n\r\n# TODOs (would love help):\r\n\r\n- [ ] Write a test for a plugin load error\r\n\r\nOther related: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack/issues/66",

However, no matter the return value configured, a new line is always appended.  This means even when lines are removed a blank new line is still added.  This results in large, blank, stack traces:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5067638/24320729/1d2859ec-10f8-11e7-9994-e1ff35c51c30.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR simply returns the _exact_ value the user has configured in their `formatError` function, without appending a newline to it.  This allows for removing lines from the stack trace:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5067638/24320813/452f4db8-10fa-11e7-8b5e-1030b9b93252.png)\r\n",

Although, they can provide a custom `toString()` function if they want:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnew Proxy(function x () {}, {get: function () { return function () { return x.toString() }; }}).toString()\r\n// \"function x() {}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, we should attempt to serialize normally and fallback if we fail. In this PR:\r\n\r\n- Added test for proxy behavior\r\n- Added serialization fallback for proxies\r\n\r\nHere's proof of it working with Electron:\r\n\r\n```\r\nObject{clipboard: Object{availableFormats: Proxy(function remoteMemberFunction(...) { ... }), has: Proxy(function remoteMemberFunction(...) { ... }), \r\n```",

There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.\n\nI recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint.\nGiven that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\n\nDo you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?\nAre you unsure about how things are supposed to work?\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things.

This led to confusing, generic adapter errors. This commit fixes that by replacing the offending code with a (likely) equivalent. \nTo replicate issue, include patterns that amount to duplicate files.\nTo see the error, wrap the following statement `if (other && other.compare(p) < 0) return` (contained inside `file-list.js`) in a `try {} catch () {}` block. In essence, `other.compare` does not exist.\n\nMight be related to issue #2194 \n",

    "body": "We’re encountering a problem where sometimes Karma just disconnects and stops running tests until we restart Karma manually.\n\nWe found that some of our JavaScript code intermittently gets stuck when running tests — that Karma considers it a time out. One such example is an infinite loop in the code.\n\nLooking at other issues (https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/598, https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/1514) suggests adding `browserDisconnectTolerance`.

    "body": "I am currently attempting to get Karma running with Electron. There are a lot of benefits to this:\n- Can hide Electron windows like PhantomJS\n- Can load modules easily via `require`\n- Environment is identical to production if we are building an Electron app (which I am)\n- Built-in screenshot support for visual diffs\n\nUnfortunately, the current Karma implementation is incompatible with Electron.\n\nIf we use an iframe, we lose the Node.js integration and must polyfill it via `window.parent`. This works great for top level modules but submodules have their global context executed in the `window.parent` which makes using `mocha` impossible =/\n\n> For reference, here was our polyfill to date: https://github.com/twolfson/karma-electron/blob/3.0.1/lib/node-integration-iframe.mustache.js\n\nOther alternatives from an iframe for Electron are `window.open`, `<webview>`, and launching multiple `BrowserWindow` instances. Unfortunately, these options are executed in separate processes so we cannot use `window.opener` as per usual.\n- `window.open` defines a proxy where we can run `eval` and `postMessage`\n  - Documentation: https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/v0.36.10/docs/api/window-open.md\n- `<webview>` defines `executeJavaScript` and `send`\n  - Both of these methods are similar to `window.open` except they can receive responses whereas neither `eval` nor `postMessage` can directly receive responses (although we can send a corresponding `postMessage` reply or build a bridge library to match requests/responses)\n  - Documentation: https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/v0.36.10/docs/api/web-view-tag.md\n- Launching new `BrowserWindow` via Electron seems too custom to Electron to be reusable elsewhere\n  - I should note that we would have `sendSync` in the browser which allows for synchronous function calls and responses but this only works when sending from `renderer` to `main` processes\n\nI decided to use `window.open` since it doesn't require any duplicate logic for other browsers and is easily polyfilled for older browsers to use `contextWindow`.\n\nIn this PR, I have a proof of concept working with the `karma-electron` test suite but the PR is far from done.\n\nMatching test suite: https://github.com/twolfson/karma-electron/tree/ba7d54bf4d941200c9c15d94ebf0cbfd7546d5c7\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this PR?\n",

    "body": "I have not identified and fixed the problem with the 3rd-party reporters not working. The problem was that the reporters didn't update the `USE_COLORS` property, from its default value: `false`. The feature relies highly on this property to be updated and when it wasn't, the reporter would be interpreted as a no-color reporter.\n\nIn-order not to break backwards compatibility, a new property was introduced: `EXCLUSIVELY_USE_COLORS` with `undefined` as it's default value. By using this property, the no-colours feature (in the run command) will work for default reporters, i.e. dots and process, and reporters choosing to update the property. \n\nWhen fixing this, it became obvious why 3rd-party reporters didn't wan't to update this property: They didn't want to implement two reporters, because this would require for their users to add two reporters to their configuration.\n\nFor instance; for the mocha reporter, used in #1894, to implement this feature they would first implement two reporters, say `reporter:mocha` and `reporter:mocha_color`, which would yield a configuration as: \n\n```\nreporters: ['mocha', 'mocha_color'] \n```\n\nwhere omitting one would disable reporting w/w.o colours, depending on the omitted reporter.\n\nI fixed this in 3294a15 by attempting (silently) to load a \"coloured\" version of a given reporter. Thus for the mocha reporter to support this feature, all they need to do is implement and export two reporters: `reporter:mocha` and `reporter:mocha_color`. The user-configurations would remain unchanged: I.e.\n\n```\nreporters: ['mocha'] \n```\n\nGiven a reporter with name `foo` the coloured version must be named `foo_color`, i.e. with postfix `_color`. \n",

After this event you are sure that you have correct karma port number.\n\nYou may use it like this:\n\n```\nlet server = new Server(karmaConfig, done);\nserver.once('listening', function (e, port) {\n    console.log(port); //port number from event\n    console.log(server.get('config').port); // also correct value\n});\n```\n",

    "body": "This feature allows the user to specify if running the runner or server (singlerun) should return non-zero exit code when executing an empty test-suite. The field `failOnEmptyTestSuite : boolean` is added to the configuration file with default value `true`.\n\n**The problem:** If the option is set to `false` and an empty test-suite is executed then the program should exit with exit-code `0` and display a warning. \n\n**The solution:** Can be divided into two sub-problems:\n1. Adding the feature to the server for single-run executions\n2. Adding the feature to the runner.\n\nThe first case is relatively simple: Besides adding the above option to the configuration file, only an extra check needs to be added at `lib/server.js:254`. \n\nThe second case however is a bit more tricky:\n\nSending the configuration from the runner to the server would allow the server to respond with the the appropriate exit-code. However, the runner would not know if the code was due to a successful execution or execution of an empty test-suite. Thus, the runner is not able to display a warning correctly. \n\nAlternatively one could reserve an exit-code to distinct between these cases, e.g. \n- `0` = success\n- `1` = error\n- `2` = empty test suite\n\nand thus not having to transmit the configuration to the server, letting the logger decide on the appropriate exit-code and warning. \n\nLastly, one could change the server response from: `...\\x1FEXIT<exit-code>` to `...\\x1FEXIT<non-empty-indicator><exit-code>`, where the `<non-empty-indicator>` would be `0` if the test-suite was empty and 1 otherwise, allowing the runner to act accordingly. This solution imposes no restrictions on the exit-code and does not require sending additional configuration from the runner to the server.\n\nHere I went with the last option.\n",

    "body": "Some browsers (Chrome) drastically increase the `setTimeout` interval if the tab is not visible on screen. This creates [issues in karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-chrome-launcher/issues/44) if you push Chrome to the background (i.e. while using `autoWatch`).\n\nThis inserts [HackTimer.js](https://github.com/turuslan/HackTimer) before any other javascript on each html page (`client`, `debug`, `context`). That may have been overkill. I did not test to see if one page in particular was creating the problem. What I can say is that it _drastically_ improves execution time for tests running in out-of-site Chrome tabs.\n\nAn [issue has been opened](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=485425) with the Chromium team to address this via a cli flag, but there is no movement on that yet. I have not tested to see if the problem exists in other browsers (I saw an SO posts that suggest it does).\n\nAt present, [HackTimer.js has not specified an open source license](https://github.com/turuslan/HackTimer/issues/6), so this PR is probably a no-go until that is resolved. There also appear to be no unit tests for the library, so that is a potential concern as well. Until those are resolved, this PR serves as a proof of concept.\n\nAn additional possibility would be making the inclusion of the scripts optional via the config. Ideally it would be configurable per browser, and have the ability to forcibly disable across all browsers via the karma `cli` (when running on CI servers for instance).\n\nInterested parties can install this hotfix via:\n\n``` bash\n npm install --save-dev jamestalmage/karma#hack-timer-dist\n```\n",

This is the case when using the webpack preprocessor where stack entries look like: `at base/main.js?<sha1>:44977`.

What I mean by this is that it's possible that the real bug is that when using webpack, the reported stack traces are not correct. Currently, there are reported like this `at base/test/main.js?1f50f4d71de2570a00bab944fc506d6900a3b1ed:44977` while from the current tests, they should have been written `at http://localhost:9876/test/main.js?1f50f4d71de2570a00bab944fc506d6900a3b1ed:44977`.

    "body": "Hello,\n\nKarma is a wonderful spec runner. However, it is kinda design to work with AngularJS. I'm at the moment exploring various ways of testing client side code. Some frameworks (or apps) require having `<script>` or HTML tags on the page in order to work. I'm using TODOMVC as a example and I'm trying to test it by using different tools. This PR introduces one more property to the `client` configuration item.\n\n``` js\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\n  config.set({\n\n    // base path that will be used to resolve all patterns (eg. files, exclude)\n    basePath: '',\n\n\n    client: {\n      contextFile: '/TestRunner.html'\n    },\n\n    ...\n```\n\nThe content of the `TestRunner.html` is the same as the content of `static/context.html`. The only one difference is that I added what I needed there. In my case this was a Backbone app and I placed the templates along with the application's HTML. Here is how my test suite looks like:\n\n``` js\ndescribe(\"Testing TODOMVC\", function () {\n\n    var setText = function(text, selector) {\n        var input = $(selector || '#new-todo');\n        var e = $.Event(\"keypress\");\n        e.which = e.keyCode = 13;\n        return input.val(text).trigger(e);\n    };\n\n    before(function() {\n        window.localStorage.removeItem('todos-backbone', '');\n        app.todos.reset();\n    });\n\n    it(\"Adding new TODOs\", function () {\n        setText('TODO A');\n        setText('TODO B');\n        expect($('#todo-list li').length).to.be.equal(2);\n    });\n\n    it(\"Deleting TODO\", function () {\n        $('#todo-list li:first-child .destroy').click();\n        expect($('#todo-list li').length).to.be.equal(1);\n    });\n\n    it(\"Edit and add TODOs\", function () {\n        setText('A new TODO');\n        $('#todo-list li:first-child').addClass('editing');\n        setText('A new TODO', '#todo-list li:first-child .edit').blur();\n        expect($('#todo-list li').length).to.be.equal(2);\n        expect($('#todo-list li label').eq(0).text()).to.be.equal($('#todo-list li label').eq(1).text())\n    });\n\n});\n```\n\nRef: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/488\n",

It really just some formalization of [danielabar's hack](https://github.com/danielabar/hack-karma-https) as I need this to support some internal e2e testing using karma.  \n\nTo us this, add this to the karma.conf.js file:\n\n```\nprotocol: 'https'\n```\n\nBy default, this will create a self-signed certificate that lasts 1 day to be used by the karma server.  If you want to supply your own certificate, add the following property to the karma.conf.js file:\n\n```\ncert: {\n   key: 'name_of_key.pem_file',\n   cert: 'name_of_cert.pem_file'\n}\n```\n\nCaveats:\n- If you are using self-signed certificates, you need to modify the karma-chrome-launcher module by adding these additional options when launching:\n  \n  '--ignore-certificate-errors',\n  '--ignore-urlfetcher-cert-requests',\n\nOtherwise, the browser will hang waiting for a confirmation that it is okay to visit a site with a self-signed certificate.  I have not found a way to do this for Firefox or other browsers.\n- I found that I had to use version 0.8.3 of the modified [node-http-proxy](https://github.com/jayv/node-http-proxy) in place of the default http-proxy in order to run e2e tests with embedded frames.  This version properly handles location header rewriting so that access to proxied content within an iframe works properly.  This was an issue for us when redirects were occurring.\n\nNot sure if this is worth pulling into karma for everyone as there are some pretty big caveats, but wanted to get a PR in place as we are using this now.\n",

[Gaze](https://github.com/shama/gaze) has some of its own issues (particularly related to ST3), but largely seems to be more stable and reliable than Karma's old approach.  Gaze is fairly widely used, and notbaly provides the underlying functionality for [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch).\n\nAdditionally, we now watch files according to their relative paths (rather than the absolute path that config.js computes for us).  This seems to prevent Gaze from inadvertently traversing filesystem boundaries (which hurts performance, and breaks the detection of new files).\n\nMost unit tests in watcher.js were removed, because Gaze implements its own test suite, which doesn't need to be replicated here.  If there's any functionality that you think should be tested, please leave a comment.\n\nWhen this PR is merged, it may make sense to start cleaning up file_list.js, and removing globbing hacks wherever we can, and delegate that functionality out to an external library.\n",

In Firefox this resulted in an error message with some weird formatting: \"TypeError: Argument 1 of Window.getComputedStyle does not implement interface Element. in http://172.20.132.80:8080/base/app/SilverApp/services/DragAvatarProducer.js?dc125e476a15c0e2f62b00901b3d0c1b6c407af8 (line 85)\". The problem with that string is the line number is formatted \"(line 85)\" when it should be like \":85:7\". This might be a bug against Firefox.\n2) Karma's source-map support tried to parse the line & column, but couldn't because the formatting was weird. (see: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/lib/reporter.js#L36 )\n3) Karma uses defaults of 0 for the line & column numbers. (see: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/lib/reporter.js#L45 )\n4) The source-map library throws an exception if line or column is 0.

This is useful for test purposes, and enables the test case to run faster, by not waiting for the server to shut down via the second parameter.\n\n---\n\nThere are some design decisions here which you might not like, such as using `mockery` rather than creating test fixtures outside of the test, or adding an object of callbacks to the server opener to help with testing it (it might be nice to have for other reasons, like bonus logging points or something). And of course, the main changes might be restructured in different ways too.

The quickest fix is to default this timeout to 0. While it fixes my immediate problem, I'm not sure what are the consequences to Karma of doing so. I'm not sure if Karma is associating any data with a socket in the way that would make usage of socket.io store - in this case defaulting this timeout to 0 could have some side effect.\n\nSo, once again, fishing for feedback here more than expecting it to be merged immediately. \n",

In fact the connection was aborting without any error after one http chunk was sent over the network. So it means that serving big js file can cause random issues.\n\nI think this options should be set to true by default.\n\nBut I would even go further, in fact I don't think it's a good idea to let node handling the gzip compression since it's single threaded which can potentially blow the performances.\nI have done some experiment on my own branch https://github.com/yhwh/karma/commit/f83faf4cea245b1ab7176111685fd198dd45d387\nI removed the the hostname/port options couple and created 4 others instead \n- clientHost the host used by the browser (and the runner)\n- clientPort the port used by the browser (and the runner)\n- serverPort the host the server will listen to\n- serverHost the port the server will listen to\n  By doing this I was able to put nginx between my browserstack tunnel and my karma server (on travis).\n  https://github.com/yhwh/stimuli/blob/master/.nginx/nginx.conf\n  I decided to serve the static files as well through and handle the gzip compression through nginx.\n  I just had to switch to xhr-polling only, because even if nginx support websockets it doesn't work with old webkits implementation so phantomjs and safari 5 were not able to connect. It seems to have improved the overall performances (but it could be due to the resultBuffer of xhr-polling).\n  What I know for sure is that using nginx as several advantage:\n- it should scale better when finely tuned\n- it's extremely flexible you can create dynamic rules for proxying etc... \n\nWhat do you think ?\n",

So I decided to add a disconnect tolerance option, which allow to rerun the browser tests (a specified amount of time) in case of disconnection and my build went green again (see the \"DISCONNECT\" in https://travis-ci.org/yhwh/stimuli/builds/12072006).\nOutside of my own build scope, I think this option would be very useful when you run tests on a complex app with a flaky connection between the browsers and the server (wifi, cloud etc...).\n\nAlso I didn't write any tests for this since I didn't see in the build and in the test folder a normalised way to write integration tests of this kind, I would suggest to use node-webkit to create a custom test processor since it allows to mix the node context with a webkit context.

    "body": "Guys, I know you gonna hate me, but I was fiddling with the config file during migrating whole AngularJS test suite to latest karma@canary and realized I'm not happy with the config syntax.\n\nSo I'm proposing another little change, here's an example:\n\n``` javascript\n// before:\nmodule.exports = function(karma) {\n  karma.configure({port: 123});\n  karma.defineLauncher('x', 'Chrome', {\n    flags: ['--disable-web-security']\n  });\n  karma.definePreprocessor('y', 'coffee', {\n    bare: false\n  });\n  karma.defineReporter('z', 'coverage', {\n    type: 'html'\n  });\n};\n\n// after:\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\n  config.set({\n    port: 123,\n    definedLaunchers: {\n      'x': {\n        base: 'Chrome',\n        flags: ['--disable-web-security']\n      }\n    },\n    definedPreprocessors: {\n      'y': {\n        base: 'coffee',\n        bare: false\n      }\n    },\n    definedReporters: {\n      'z': {\n        base: 'coverage',\n        type: 'html'\n      }\n    }    \n  });\n\n  // but now, you can also change the config directly\n  // so you can load shared config and change only some bits\n  require('./shared.conf')(config);\n  config.a.b = '...';\n\n  // using only config.set (or karma.configure),\n  // you could only override config.a (the entire object)\n};\n```\n\n**The reasons for this change:**\n1/ easier to override config properties\nThe config object was not exposed and karma.configure() only does shallow merge.\nNow, this is possible, eg. config.sauceLabs.testName = 'overridden';\nThis is helpful especially when using multiple config files (eg. a shared config between multiple projects or having a per developer config file that overrides project defaults).\n\n2/ declarative definition of custom launchers/preprocessors/reporters makes more consistent and therefore easier to explain.\n\n3/ declarative definition of custom launchers/preprocessors/reporters also makes it possible to use these with grunt-karma or from JSON config file.\n\nThe change is done in a backwards compatible manner, if one use old APIs such as karma.configure() or karma.defineLauncher(), it works. Only warning is displayed. These extra APIs will be removed in v0.11.0.\n\n**Please, let me know, what you think.** I was about to push the current canary into stable, but I think we should do this before, so that people using stable version only have to migrate their configs one.\n\nCC @Dignifiedquire, @bitwiseman, @gfxmonk, @iammerrick\n",

This adds the ability to log to a file and stuff like that.\n- Internally I've changed the tests to use the log event emitted by the logger when testing for console output.\n- Because of the way log4js works global configuration of the log level no takes precedence over the local definition. \n- The tests have now the ugly side effect of printing the log messages. I don't know how to mock `console.log` to remove that. If anyone knows how to do that please let me know.\n\nThis pull isn't finished by any means.

The entire final list of files _could_ come back sorted because async callbacks for reading files from a directory can return out of order.\n\nThis works if you are using a single directory because the end result is that the file list is sorted alphabetically, which is how we expect a directory listing to return.\n\nHowever, if you have files which need to be loaded in a specific order, and they are in different directories, it does not always work.\n\nFor example, if the testacular.conf config file specifies paths like this:\n\nb/first.js\na/last.js\n\nAnd, you need to load b/first.js first, and then load a/last.js next, the current implementation of testacular _can_ fail (though might not fail).  It is unfortunately non-deterministic, because the loading of b/first.js could return first, and then sorting does not occur.  But, you could get a situation where the list of files gets returned as [ 'a/last.js', 'b/first.js' ].  If you have defined something in b/first.js that a/last.js depends on, errors occur.\n\nI've forked the repo, and I think the solution is simply to remove the sorting function and load files synchronously.\n\nhttps://github.com/xrd/testacular\nhttps://github.com/xrd/testacular/blob/master/lib/config.js\n\nI tried to create a repository which shows the failure and uses my patch to show the problem, but since this bug is not guaranteed to occur, it was difficult to isolate in my test example.  But, the repository is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/xrd/testacular-load-order\n(with-patch.js checks out fixed version, runs npm install, and then runs the test and without-patch.js checks out old version (unpatched testacular), npm installs, and runs test...)\n\nChris\n",
