      "Welcome @fpm-peter! <br><br>It looks like this is your first PR to <a href='https://github.com/kubernetes-client/javascript'>kubernetes-client/javascript</a> 🎉. Please refer to our [pull request process documentation](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md) to help your PR have a smooth ride to approval. <br><br>You will be prompted by a bot to use commands during the review process. Do not be afraid to follow the prompts! It is okay to experiment. [Here is the bot commands documentation](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands). <br><br>You can also check if kubernetes-client/javascript has [its own contribution guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/javascript/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). <br><br>You may want to refer to our [testing guide](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md) if you run into trouble with your tests not passing. <br><br>If you are having difficulty getting your pull request seen, please follow the [recommended escalation practices](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#why-is-my-pull-request-not-getting-reviewed). Also, for tips and tricks in the contribution process you may want to read the [Kubernetes contributor cheat sheet](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/contributor-cheatsheet/README.md).

The exec-websocket-return is ignored in cpFromPod since this also proves nothing but that a connection got established - which is the problem of the bug in the first place.\r\nI didn't find anything in other tests but is there an established way to test with an actual pod?",

After careful consideration and evaluation of the project's requirements, it has been determined that removing underscore.js will bring several benefits.\r\nUnderscore js is an external dependency that needs to be maintained and updated alongside the project. By removing the library, we reduce the number of dependencies we need to manage, simplify the maintenance process, and potentially avoid compatibility issues or security vulnerabilities. Including Underscore.js in the project adds unnecessary file size and overhead, as it introduces an extra dependency that needs to be loaded by the application. Removing Underscore.js will help reduce the overall size of the project and potentially improve performance, particularly if a significant portion of its features is not utilized.\r\n\r\n",

This new version of <code>__spreadArray</code> is backwards-compatible and is often also faster. See <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/tslib/pull/151\">microsoft/tslib#151</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>tslib 2.2.0</h2>\n<p>This release supports TypeScript 4.3's new functionality for ECMAScript private methods and accessors, and private static class members.</p>\n<p>It does so by expanding the scope of <code>__classPrivateFieldGet</code> and <code>__classPrivateFieldSet</code>. See <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/tslib/pull/146\">microsoft/tslib#146</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>tslib 2.1.0</h2>\n<p>This release adds a new <code>__spreadArray</code> helper which avoids side-effects compared to the now-deprecated <code>__spreadArrays</code> and <code>__spread</code> helpers. See <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/tslib/pull/133\">microsoft/tslib#133</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>This release also provides a more-specific error message when extending from a type which is not a function and not null.

Moreover, we added support for asdf format as Node.js version file <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/373\">actions/setup-node#373</a>. Besides, we introduced new output <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/534\">node-version</a> and added <code>npm-shrinkwrap.json</code> to dependency file patterns: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/439\">actions/setup-node#439</a></p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 2.0.2</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes related to GHES 3.5 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/460\">actions/setup-node#460</a>)</p>\n<h2>v3.0.0</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we changed version of the runtime Node.js for the setup-node action and updated package-lock.json file to  v2.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the update to Node 16 in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/414\">actions/setup-node#414</a>, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.</li>\n<li>We removed deprecated <code>version</code> input (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/424\">actions/setup-node#424</a>). Please use <code>node-version</code> input instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fix logic of error handling for npm warning and uncaught exception</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we fix logic of error handling related to caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/358\">actions/setup-node#358</a>) and (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/359\">actions/setup-node#359</a>).</p>\n<p>In the previous behaviour we relied on <code>stderr</code> output to throw error. The warning messages from package managers can be written to the stderr's output. For now the action will throw an error only if exit code differs from zero. Besides, we add logic to сatch and log unhandled exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <code>node-version-file</code> input and update <code>actions/cache</code> dependency to the latest version.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>The new input (<code>node-version-file</code>) provides functionality to specify the path to the file containing Node.js's version with such behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the file does not exist the action will throw an error.</li>\n<li>If you specify both <code>node-version</code> and <code>node-version-file</code> inputs, the action will use value from the <code>node-version</code> input and throw the following warning: <code>Both node-version and node-version-file inputs are specified, only node-version will be used</code>.</li>\n<li>For now the action does not support all of the variety of values for Node.js version files. The action can handle values according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node#supported-version-syntax\">documentation</a> and values with <code>v</code> prefix (<code>v14</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - name: Setup node from node version file\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n    with:\n      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'\n  - run: npm install\n  - run: npm test\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Update actions/cache dependency to 1.0.8 version.</h2>\n<p>We updated actions/cache dependency to the latest version (1.0.8). For more information please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md\">toolkit/cache</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add &quot;cache-hit&quot; output</h2>\n<p>This release introduces a new output: <code>cache-hit</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/327\">#327</a>).</p>\n<p>The <code>cache-hit</code> output contains boolean value indicating that an exact match was found for the key. It shows that the action uses already existing cache or not. The output is available only if cache is enabled.</p>\n<h2>Support caching for mono repos and repositories with complex structure</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/305\">#305</a>).</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (<code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code>) in the repository root. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories. This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This new version of <code>__spreadArray</code> is backwards-compatible and is often also faster. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/tslib/pull/151\">microsoft/tslib#151</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>tslib 2.2.0</h2>\n<p>This release supports TypeScript 4.3's new functionality for ECMAScript private methods and accessors, and private static class members.</p>\n<p>It does so by expanding the scope of <code>__classPrivateFieldGet</code> and <code>__classPrivateFieldSet</code>. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/tslib/pull/146\">microsoft/tslib#146</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>tslib 2.1.0</h2>\n<p>This release adds a new <code>__spreadArray</code> helper which avoids side-effects compared to the now-deprecated <code>__spreadArrays</code> and <code>__spread</code> helpers. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/tslib/pull/133\">microsoft/tslib#133</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>This release also provides a more-specific error message when extending from a type which is not a function and not null.

Moreover, we added support for asdf format as Node.js version file <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/373\">actions/setup-node#373</a>. Besides, we introduced new output <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/534\">node-version</a> and added <code>npm-shrinkwrap.json</code> to dependency file patterns: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/439\">actions/setup-node#439</a></p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 2.0.2</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes related to GHES 3.5 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/460\">actions/setup-node#460</a>)</p>\n<h2>v3.0.0</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we changed version of the runtime Node.js for the setup-node action and updated package-lock.json file to  v2.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the update to Node 16 in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/414\">actions/setup-node#414</a>, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.</li>\n<li>We removed deprecated <code>version</code> input (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/424\">actions/setup-node#424</a>). Please use <code>node-version</code> input instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fix logic of error handling for npm warning and uncaught exception</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we fix logic of error handling related to caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/358\">actions/setup-node#358</a>) and (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/359\">actions/setup-node#359</a>).</p>\n<p>In the previous behaviour we relied on <code>stderr</code> output to throw error. The warning messages from package managers can be written to the stderr's output. For now the action will throw an error only if exit code differs from zero. Besides, we add logic to сatch and log unhandled exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <code>node-version-file</code> input and update <code>actions/cache</code> dependency to the latest version.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>The new input (<code>node-version-file</code>) provides functionality to specify the path to the file containing Node.js's version with such behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the file does not exist the action will throw an error.</li>\n<li>If you specify both <code>node-version</code> and <code>node-version-file</code> inputs, the action will use value from the <code>node-version</code> input and throw the following warning: <code>Both node-version and node-version-file inputs are specified, only node-version will be used</code>.</li>\n<li>For now the action does not support all of the variety of values for Node.js version files. The action can handle values according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node#supported-version-syntax\">documentation</a> and values with <code>v</code> prefix (<code>v14</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - name: Setup node from node version file\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n    with:\n      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'\n  - run: npm install\n  - run: npm test\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Update actions/cache dependency to 1.0.8 version.</h2>\n<p>We updated actions/cache dependency to the latest version (1.0.8). For more information please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md\">toolkit/cache</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add &quot;cache-hit&quot; output</h2>\n<p>This release introduces a new output: <code>cache-hit</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/327\">#327</a>).</p>\n<p>The <code>cache-hit</code> output contains boolean value indicating that an exact match was found for the key. It shows that the action uses already existing cache or not. The output is available only if cache is enabled.</p>\n<h2>Support caching for mono repos and repositories with complex structure</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/305\">#305</a>).</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (<code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code>) in the repository root. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories. This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

    "body": "When updating `execa` yesterday I noticed the `TODO` for loading a user's `$KUBECONFIG` when using WSL. Since I'm a WSL user I decided to try and resolve that `TODO`.\r\n\r\nThere are two commits here that could be different PRs if you prefer. The first commit fixes an issue I found when testing my changes. The existing code did `shelljs.homedir() + '/.kube/config'` to build the path to the default kubeconfig, but `shelljs.homedir()` is not a function and returns an error at runtime. Replacing this with `'~/.kube/config'` did work as expected for me.\r\n\r\nThe second commit handles checking for a users `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable in WSL. This required running `bash -ic` instead of just `wsl.exe` to actually load the user's environment. But using that did work as expected for me.\r\n\r\nThese changes were tested with Windows 10 and WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04.",

The calling functions use Array.prototype.forEach. From MDN \r\n\r\n> If elements that are already visited are removed (e.g. using shift()) during the iteration, later elements will be skipped\r\n\r\n**Will slice be slow?**\r\nSlice makes a shallow copy of the array, its linear with the number of callbacks added for a particular verb. Overhead should be minimal. If it is a concern, a more complex solution could be devised where .on and .off do not write to the callbackCaches during a forEach, however I prefered simplicity.\r\n\r\n**Why was the initialization of the callbackCache verbs moved to the constructor**\r\nWithout it, more complex semantics are needed to determine if it is safe to call .slice in the various locations (i.e. callbackCache[VERB] may be null and .slice would fail without a check). \r\n\r\nI think this centralizes the location of verb checking now that it happens in two locations nicely\r\n",
