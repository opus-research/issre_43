      "Hey! I appreciate your time, but since v3 dropped IE support and optional chaining has been supported for a long time, it isn't a good idea to get it back. The main reason is that it bloats the build size.\r\n\r\nI understand you need to support older browsers, and it's frustrating to deal with, but it's an uphill battle. More and more libraries will do that (I'm pretty conservative about adoption; the presence of CommonJS is proof of that), and you'll have to deal with it again. So, I advise you to transpile your dependencies to target the browsers you need via Babel & Browserslist.\r\n\r\nI'm closing the PR unless you have a strong argument about why date-fns must support optional chaining in 2024.",

Of course, you know better, so take it with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\n> Don't know, how much bytes will it cost, to approve this PR. \r\n\r\nIt's actually pretty significant, considering optional chaining is probably not the only issue you will encounter.\r\n\r\n> Thanks for great lib!\r\n\r\nYou're welcome!"

However, this implementation does no longer allow for more advanced partial application scenarios, because they can't be properly implemented in TypeScript (to my current knowledge – maybe this has become possible in recent TS versions, but neither [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) nor [effect-ts](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) do this, so I assume it still isn't possible).\r\n\r\nAn example of what would no longer be possible is this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nit(\"allows to group arguments\", () => {\r\n  const fpFn = convertToFP(fn, 3);\r\n  assert(fpFn(3, 2)(1) === \"1 2 3\");\r\n  assert(fpFn(3)(2, 1) === \"1 2 3\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is an example that I would like to question: this seems really unsound and unnecessary to me, is this really something that needs to be supported?\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nit(\"ignores calls without curried arguments\", () => {\r\n  const fpFn = convertToFP(fn, 3);\r\n  assert(fpFn()()(3, 2)()()(1) === \"1 2 3\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the type-safety gained is more important than being able to write `fpFn(3, 2)(1)` instead of the simpler (and more idiomatic/pipeline-compatible in TS functional programming) `fpFn(3)(2)(1)`. My question for resolving this issue is whether this kind of currying could be removed as a way forward with this PR or whether there are other ideas.",

All tests were successfully passed. \r\n\r\nFor this issue, I made the following changes:\r\n\r\n**1.   subDays/test.ts**\r\n- [x] - Added a test check for subtracting through UTC time.\r\n\r\n**2.  addDays/test.ts**\r\n- [x] - Added a test check for adding through UTC time.\r\n- [x] - Deleted offset calculation because it is no longer necessary for the new calculation in addDays/index.ts. (This calculation was used with 4 tests)\r\n- [x] - Deleted the `MINUTE` variable because it is not used now.\r\n\r\n**3. addDays/index.ts**\r\n- [x] - Changed the calculation algorithm from `_date.setDate(_date.getDate() + amount)` to a new calculation based on milliseconds. (As was described in the issue description)\r\n\r\n**4. addWeeks/index.ts**\r\n- [x] - Deleted the old calculation based on `addDays()` function because this function has new calculation logic now. Changed its calculation for its old algorithm logic  `_date.setDate(_date.getDate() + amount * 7)`. In fact, there was only 1 line added.\r\n- [x] - Deleted the import for `addDays()`, because it is not used now.\r\n\r\n**5. nextMondays/tests.ts**\r\n- [x] - Only minor editing of details to make the code consistent. Changed months in the dates so they would be consistent with other functions such as: `nextTuesday()`, `nextWednesday()`, `nextThursday()`, `nextFriday()`, `nextSaturday()`, `nextSunday()`.",

Including the appropriate configuration for a project allows contributors to work entirely within a web browser via `GH Codespaces`, or inside of fully, and correctly configured containers on their own computer with `VS Code Remote Containers` (both of these use the same configuration, as `GH Codespaces` leverages the `Remote Containers` features under the hood).\r\n\r\nFor the `date-fns` project, this configuration includes the following:\r\n- Preinstalled `Node LTS`\r\n- Preinstalled `yarn@1.x`\r\n- Preinstalled `ESLint` and `Prettier` extensions\r\n- Preinstalled `playwright` dependencies\r\n- Automation of the `yarn install` when the devcontainer is first created\r\n\r\nBasically everything needed for a contributor to open the project after a fresh clone and be immediately productive, either locally with `VS Code` or remotely with `GitHub Codespaces`!\r\n\r\nFor reference, here are some other repositories for whom I've opened PRs to do the same:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/AnilSeervi/inspirational-quotes/pull/19\r\n- https://github.com/Icon-Shelf/icon-shelf/pull/135 (note that this one is a GUI electron app, but it's still possible to containerize it and do development in the cloud on GH Codespaces!)\r\n- https://github.com/developertools-tech/developertools.tech/issues/36\r\n- https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui/pull/2606\r\n- https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/pull/5631\r\n- https://github.com/EveryBoard/EveryBoard/pull/155\r\n- https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui/pull/658\r\n- https://github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw/pull/108\r\n",

This PR makes a few changes so that `roundToNearestMinutes()` fixes that misbehaviour...\r\n\r\n* Previously, there was an inexplicable `addedMinutes` variable which added minutes on to the result. There was no obvious reason for this, and it could only ever cause the result to go wrong: indeed, this seemed to be the chief culprit in the case of #3429. I have removed this variable\r\n* Fixing this behaviour caused the tests to fail. This was because the tests had been engineered to expect the wrong results. I fixed this, and while I was there, removed duplicate tests and replaced test inputs with boundary cases\r\n* Fixing the tests to expect what they ought to expect and putting in boundary cases caused further test failures. This in turn was partly because there was no account made of the milliseconds field of the input. Now, milliseconds are accounted for, which allowed some more of the tests to pass.\r\n* Finally, the remaining issue was that the rounding method was expected to default to `round`, but in fact it was defaulting to `trunc`. I have fixed this as well.\r\n\r\nNow, all tests pass, and I have manually checked that this should fix #3429 ",

    "body": "This pull request is to align the Estonian locale (et) implementation of `formatRelative` with the English one, more precisely the `nextWeek` case.\r\n\r\nFor an English locale, the `nextWeek` case would output for example `Sunday at 12:00 PM`.\r\nThe current et locale version outputs `järgmine pühapäev kell 12:00`, which in direct translation is `next Sunday at 12:00 PM`.\r\n\r\nThis in my opinion is not what I'd expect following the docs, as this is misunderstood as the *next* Sunday as in the next week, not the *upcoming* Sunday in the current week.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to remove the \"järgmine\" word so that the output aligns more with the default locale.\r\nSo the output would be \"pühapäev kell 12:00\".\r\n\r\n_Note: as Estonian speakers know, this part of the language is pretty subjective. For example \"järgmine reede\" can be interpreted differently by each speaker, it's more of a cultural thing. My proposed variant is less subjective (which is a good thing imo), but makes combining the output of formatRelative a bit harder to use in a sentence that answers \"Millal?\". But I'd say it's a net positive tradeoff._",

A client of mine filed a bug with me because they were missing a comma between date and time, so I did some research and found [sources](https://dict.leo.org/grammatik/deutsch/Rechtschreibung/Regeln/Interpunktion/Komma/Angaben.xml?lang=de) stating that any date and time parts should be joined with a comma, much like e.g. in `en-US`. Also, [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) uses a comma (see [repro in codepen](https://codepen.io/felix-scale/pen/VwBLYWj)).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, commas should be added back to align the behavior with user expectations and Intl.DateTimeFormat.",

      "The current PR won't let you use `import { format } from 'date-fns'` nor `import { minTime } from 'date-fns/constants/index.js'`. For now, we can only use ESM with both `/esm/` *and* `index.js` in the import path, like the examples I wrote in the PR description. \r\n\r\nTo support these kinds of syntax, we need to add [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) to hundreds of `package.json`. \r\n\r\nFor example, something like this (no tested).\r\n\r\n```diff \r\n// node_modules/date-fns/daysToWeeks/package.json\r\n{\r\n    \"sideEffects\": false,\r\n    \"module\": \"../esm/daysToWeeks/index.js\",\r\n    \"typings\": \"../typings.d.ts\",\r\n+   \"exports\": {\r\n+       {\r\n+           \".\": {\r\n+               \"import\": \"../esm/daysToWeeks/index.js\",\r\n+               \"require\": \"./index.js\"\r\n+           },\r\n+           \"./index.js\": {\r\n+               \"import\": \"../esm/daysToWeeks/index.js\",\r\n+               \"require\": \"./index.js\"\r\n+           }\r\n+       }\r\n+   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Notice that the existing `\"module\"` field in `package.json` is [not supported](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42817320/9426588) by Node.js.)\r\n\r\nI'd like to help, however, I feel the building system in `date-fns` is too complex for me to get it done. For example, why does `node_modules/date-fns/compareDesc/package.json` exists but `node_modules/date-fns/constants/package.json` not exists. \r\n\r\nMaybe you can take over this PR? Or just merge this PR at the current state and push another PR before the next release? \r\n",

I think this will be very valuable to the community to have easy access to this information.\r\n\r\nYou can preview the generated page here: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/9bb51691f201c3ec05ab832acbc5d478f2e5c47a/docs/i18nLocales.md\r\n\r\nA few things to point out:\r\n\r\n- I turned on the `jsdoc-to-markdown` cache, as it seems to work well and detects file changes correctly. On my machine, it takes almost 2 minutes on an empty cache to generate the docs, but completes in 420ms with cache and one source file modified.\r\n- This new docs generation script will fail if the `@summary` jsdoc tags of locales are not unique. Hoping this will help people build out locale selectors without duplicate entries. I made some adjustments to a few locale's jsdoc entries to fix typos, uniqueness and precision.\r\n- To complete the TypeScript conversion, I had to add some type definitions to `package.json`. I kept the changes to a minimum.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!\r\n\r\nEDIT: also fixes a docs bug for FP ESM usage, [see comment below](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/2838#issuecomment-991941546)",

The ISO 8601 week calendar is distinct to other widely used week calendars; technically speaking it's a [leap week calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_week_calendar) with a different year grouping compared to other calendars which limits its uses (it even triggered a [Twitter bug](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/29/twitter-2015-date-bug) back in 2014).

      "After looking into this again, I've come to the conclusion that this change will introduce new flow errors for any users who have strict mode configured with `unclear-type` because of the liberal use of `any` in the `date-fns` types. In theory any users who don't have strict mode configured would not get any new errors, but users of strict mode would get new errors from `date-fns` files for any lint rules they have in their strict mode config that `date-fns` would not conform to, including `unclear-type` which is likely the most common strict mode lint.\r\n\r\nIn theory the only way to ensure that the types from `date-fns` would not introduce errors in any strict mode config would be to refine the types such that with every lint that flow offers turned on, a flow check would result in no errors or warnings. \r\n\r\nA more reasonable course of action would likely be to strive to conform to a reasonable set of lint rules. Flow [recommends a basic set of lint rules](https://flow.org/en/docs/strict/#toc-features) for strict mode in their docs. This would certainly be a lot of work given the current state of the types."

      "@vizcay not directly from a CDN, but you could clone my branch, build the Deno files and copy them to your app temporarily if you can't wait for an official release.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to follow (assuming you have Node and Deno installed on that machine):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# clone & checkout the PR branch\r\ngit clone git@github.com:fturmel/date-fns.git\r\ncd date-fns\r\ngit checkout PR/deno-fixes\r\n\r\n# build & test Deno version\r\nyarn install\r\n./scripts/build/deno.sh\r\n./scripts/test/deno.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the build and test shell scripts run successfully, you can copy the content of the `date-fns/deno` directory in your project and import the lib with a relative path. Here's a quick example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as dateFns from './date-fns-deno/index.js';\r\n\r\nconst res = dateFns.parseISO('2010-03-14', {});\r\nconsole.log(res); // 2010-03-14T05:00:00.000Z\r\n```",

You can't bulk-import the whole library for now but can still use the functions that are not missing import statements if you import them individually.\r\n\r\nEvery module entry point is an `index.js` or `index.ts` file inside a directory that matches the function name. You can conveniently browse the file system structure on the deno site if you need to verify the correct path to use: https://deno.land/x/date_fns@v2.22.1\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport parseISO from 'https://deno.land/x/date_fns@v2.22.1/parseISO/index.js';\r\n\r\nconst res = parseISO('2010-03-14', {});\r\nconsole.log(res); // 2010-03-14T05:00:00.000Z\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

I might have a look later this week and work on a PR.\r\n\r\nI think one of the reasons these missing imports are happening is because the `date-fns` project itself has `date-fns` v1 in its deps through lint-staged (pointed out in #2476) and the ambient type defs of v1 are leaking. That seems like such a dangerous setup, this transitive dependency should really be removed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"440\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-28 at 2 14 54 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4009209/147599431-651d4a4b-d659-4dd4-9af2-52b95f20f3bd.png\">\r\n",

It's an emergent platform (although maybe already stagnating a bit?), and it would be nice for date-fns to be represented, but it's not my call to make.\r\n\r\nMy counterpoints would be:\r\n\r\n- Most (all?) of the work is done already\r\n- The errors caught with this little smoke test I wrote are actual TypeScript type errors, not necessarily Deno-centric so it's helping the overall project's code quality.\r\n- Once the Deno tests run against new PRs, there would be no more catching up to do. Errors would be addressed before they are merged.\r\n- Couldn't the publishing on deno.land be fully automated with github actions, and trigger on new release/tag?",

I noticed a lot of the internal tests have inlined comments to identify months more easily, so this is one scenario that could see a slight improvement in adopting enums.\r\n\r\nex:\r\nhttps://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/ea3f05069605388af0bb6a27f8cf4539f3d70db6/src/add/test.ts#L22-L25\r\n\r\nSome thoughts on implementation:\r\n- I think this should go in the constants file instead of an additional package\r\n- Depending on what it transpiles too, you could probably just make these actual TypeScript enums. They are zero-based auto-incremented integers by default too so even simpler.\r\n- The JSDocs type should be either enum of numbers, or object with string keys and number values\r\n- Unit tests for constant values don't serve any purpose imo, so I would remove that\r\n- Up to debate whether a 3 letter abbreviation could be preferred over the full word for conciseness (`Month.Sep` vs `Month.September`)\r\n- Not in your PR (yet?), but per #2078 should the week day enum be called `DayOfWeek` or simply `Day` to match the internal type already established? I like `DayOfWeek`, but there is a precedent in the codebase to consider.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/ea3f05069605388af0bb6a27f8cf4539f3d70db6/src/types.ts#L22-L24\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/ea3f05069605388af0bb6a27f8cf4539f3d70db6/src/types.ts#L38-L40\r\n",

The project's linting approach needs a revamp now that there is more and more TypeScript code.

      "I was curious and logged a few things during the CI tests to figure out what exactly was happening.\r\n\r\n`getOperationSystemLocale()` returned 'C' because `process.env.LANG` is 'C.UTF-8' in that environment.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nnew Intl.DateTimeFormat('C').format(new Date())\r\n// Uncaught RangeError: Incorrect locale information provided\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running `yarn test` locally, the `process.env` object appears to be completely empty so that function returns `undefined`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nnew Intl.DateTimeFormat(undefined).format(new Date())\r\n// \"8/27/2021\"\r\n```\r\n"

      "> why round should be the default rounding method (which we might change in v3)?\r\n\r\nWell, my personal use case is to display images from CCTV based on user requested timestamp. Some images might not be exactly at the requested time, so I display the difference between the requested timestamp and the actual image timestamp. When the user requested `2021-04-02 12:42:40.000` and the image is at `2021-04-02 12:42:41.950`, the current implementation will give an interval of one second.\r\n\r\nI would much prefer a version with (optionally) milliseconds in the interval, but the result of 1 second is more misleading than 2 seconds: the image is nearer to 2 seconds late than 1 second late.\r\n\r\nTo be honest… I totally agree that this is a breaking change. So, I'll try to make a `roundingMethod` parameter as soon as possible with the default using the current behavior (`floor`)."

Feb. 21\" with `dd. MMM yy`, `2021-05-01` on the other hand results in \"01. Mai 21\", so without a dot. But if you work with English dates as well, it will be \"01. Feb 21\" and \"01.

Use the `\"other\"` token as default when locale's `formatRelative` does not handle a more specific token (e.g. `\"tomorrow\"` returns `undefined`) (solution suggested in https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/1273#issuecomment-522949806)\r\n2. Improve the error message thrown when `formatStr` passed to `format` is undefined.\r\n    Previously, the error message thrown in such a situation would be `RangeError: Format string contains an unescaped latin alphabet character n`, which does not really say much\r\n\r\nThe 2nd change is not mentioned specifically in the ticket, but I reckon it would at least help with debugging in some cases, especially when `format` is called internally within some other API function.\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to the project, which I am excited about 🙂 \r\n\r\n## Formatting changes\r\n\r\nI have noticed that the formatting in the files I modified differs vastly from what prettier's formatting. I presume this is because of a recent commit that upgrades prettier (https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/commit/4a328dda165320dde149c531d8643c597ce7170f), but does not reformat files.\r\n\r\nThat confused me a bit and made me spend time on verifying prettier's configuration 😄 I reckon it would be nice to clearly communicate in `CONTRIBUTING.md` that there may be formatting issues and how to proceed in such cases (reformat the file, or discard formatting changes) 🙂 That could help other contributors\r\n\r\nI separated reformatting the files I modified in this PR into separate commits. Hopefully, that makes the functional changes easier to verify\r\n\r\n## Rebuilng using `scripts/build/build.sh`\r\n\r\nI have tried running `build.sh`, as instructed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, but it failed:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n✘-INT ~/projects/open-source/date-fns [use-default-token-in-formatRelative|…1]\r\n09:17 $ ./scripts/build/build.sh\r\n+ ./scripts/build/docs.js\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'customTags' of undefined\r\n    at /home/voreny/projects/open-source/date-fns/scripts/build/docs.js:43:13\r\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\r\n    at generateDocsFromSource (/home/voreny/projects/open-source/date-fns/scripts/build/docs.js:41:6)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did not dig deep enough to find out why, as I don't have much knowledge about this build pipeline.\r\n\r\nHere are the contents of my `./tmp` directory (inside of the repo):\r\n```sh\r\n09:32 $ ls tmp --all --tree\r\ntmp\r\n├── .gitkeep\r\n└── tests_count.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know what I should do in this case 🙂 ",

      "Awesome work! While working on my own implementation I found a gotcha with `numeric: 'auto'` which might be wise to address (or at least mention in documentation). Because `RelativeTimeFormat` only takes a value and unit, it has no context/awareness of the actual difference in years. \r\n\r\nWhen I compare two dates, today (Feb 24, 2020) and almost 2 years ago (March 30, 2019).`dateFns.differenceInYears` will return '-1', which is correct, it is not 2 years ago, just one and a bit. \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nnew Intl.RelativeTimeFormat('en', { \r\n  numeric: \"auto\" \r\n}).format(-1, 'year')\r\n// 'last year'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe majority of Intl implementations will return `last year` in response to above code, which to humans is just incorrect when we are aware of comparing 2021 and 2019, which was not 'last year'. \r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/musing-river-90m6t?file=/src/index.ts\r\n\r\nSince your proposed implementation always takes two dates, you could prevent this error from occurring by having additional checks in the [unit resolver](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/2173/files#diff-85e3d08d9b516732ef39e93d178a81815de328e6929a6e218282166c1ab42556R237-R249) that only applies 'auto' when the two compared years differ exactly 1 year, and force 'numeric' in all other cases. \r\n\r\n@kossnocorp It occurs to me that maybe this more opinionated/smart logic should be in `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` instead? Alongside rounding instead of flooring (i.e. 1 year 9 months becomes 2 years) and optional joining in localized time?\r\n\r\n",
      "Or... split this implementation to:\r\n- `intlFormatDistanceStrict` which uses `numeric: always` and takes 'ceil', 'round', 'floor' arguments.\r\n-  `intlFormatDistance` which uses `numeric: auto` where applicable and generally rounds the years.\r\n\r\nMy 2cts would be to avoid providing the exact arguments of `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` and allow room to algorithmically use the right unit and formatting options.\r\n\r\nAn other thing to review would be wether outputting 'quarters' by default makes sense to most implementations. Date-fns is slightly opinionated in its other implementations (i.e. when to include time in 'relative' and never returning '4 quarters ago' in formatDistance), providing that as an option to control would make this more useful, otherwise I would find myself going back to first comparing the dates, then calling intlFormatDistance with unit months when I know we're talking about 3-12 months distance.",
      "@robertvanhoesel, this is an excellent point. Adding special logic for `numeric: 'auto'` and `-1`/`1`/`0` makes sense at first glance, not only for `year` but also `month` and `quarter`. However, I'm afraid it's a slippery slope. For instance, this is not a problem for `minute` and `hour` in English, but I imagine it might be a case for other languages or Intl implementations or wise versa might not have an issue with `year`.\r\n\r\nUsing `ceil`/`floor` won't help because rounding `4 months` to `0 years` while working with December will produce `this year` and its inaccuracy.\r\n\r\nI think instead we can use `differenceInCalendarDays`, `differenceInCalendarWeeks`, `differenceInCalendarMonths` and `differenceInCalendarYears` **unless** `numeric` is set to `always`. Then with your example, you'll get `-2 \"2 years ago\"`.\r\n\r\nWe also should make `numeric: 'auto'` the default value because such:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nnew Intl.RelativeTimeFormat('en').format(0, 'year')\r\n//=> \"in 0 years\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n..it is not a good default option. However, I'm not sure what are side effects of this change. @tan75 could you please explore that?\r\n\r\n@robertvanhoesel @tan75 @leshakoss @rikkalo WDYT?",
      "@kossnocorp \r\nIf `numeric: auto` is a default option, then when adding `style: short` it falls back to `numeric: always` (if the result is 1 day or 1 month or 1 year) e.g.:\r\n```\r\nconst result = intlFormatDistance(\r\n      new Date(1985, 4, 5, 10, 30, 0),\r\n      new Date(1985, 4, 4, 10, 30, 0),\r\n      { style: 'short' }\r\n) //=> 'in 1 day' instead of 'tomorrow'\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever it looks like explicitly adding `numeric: auto`  when calling the function will fix it (even though we know that's the case by default):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const result = intlFormatDistance(\r\n      new Date(1985, 4, 5, 10, 30, 0),\r\n      new Date(1985, 4, 4, 10, 30, 0),\r\n      { style: 'short', numeric: 'auto' }\r\n   )//=> 'tomorrow'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same happens to 1 month and 1 year\r\n[Test](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/2173/files#diff-4a1afabbb6c257e692f669f079a6cb931af4e98af4bb5bc89e2b309828e4e5a1R298-R305)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This must have fixed some issues but in this case, the `format` function returns the incorrect format when trying to format a duration due to the rounded-up offset.\r\n\r\nI tried `Math.floor` but that made other tests fail. Instead I propose using `Math.trunc` which will chop off any additional digits from the offset which I think will match what Chrome does. There could still be edge cases I'm missing so would like additional feedback.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Add failing test case when run under Firefox 84\r\n- Switch to `Math.trunc` which makes all existing tests pass and the FF test pass\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\n1. I would guess there's additional configuration needed to run the suites in Sauce Labs Firefox? Can someone help with that (or follow-up in separate PR?)\r\n2.

It doesn't sound very good to me either. If we want to have this change anyway, I'm suggesting to change it to something more like in [the attached patch](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/files/5443726/fix-future-distance.txt) to make it a bit less invasive, but I do admit that it makes the code slightly more convoluted.

[`kuluttua`](https://fi.wiktionary.org/wiki/kuluttua) refers to \"after some event\" where as [`päästä`](https://fi.wiktionary.org/wiki/p%C3%A4%C3%A4st%C3%A4#Postpositio) is used more like \"after some time\".\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd prefer `minuutti sitten` over `1 minuutti sitten` as well, what do you think?

And when the user input is processed, we always get a value of the same type so the code could continue work and output something instead of throwing an exception. Also, as you said, you can either check the result for emptiness (`Object.keys(result).length` will do the trick) or even verify the sum of values (unless you want to allow 0 duration).",

In my mind, the most semantic API would be either:\r\n* return `{}` (caller is guaranteed to receive the same return type regardless of input as @kossnocorp suggested, a la `new Date('garbage')`); or\r\n* throw `Error` (caller is explicitly forced to handle the exception thrown from attempting to set an invalid Duration, a la `JSON.parse('garbage')`)\r\n \r\nHowever, `throw` feels a little nuclear to me, for something that's essentially a nice-to-have utility.",

I've added helper scripts so you can migrate code yourself. \r\n\r\nProposed todo:\r\n\r\n1. `yarn ts-migrate:rename-all` Will rename .js → .ts files in `src/*` directory. `ts-migrate` has no way to specify directory to apply renaming, so it does `./*` and then its manually removes renames except in `src` and reverts to git state (run and you'll see)\r\n2. `yarn ts-migrate:migrate` will migrate all files in `src/*` to TypeScript. It mostly adds \"@ts-expect-error\", so it will compile, but it is not \"true\" migration.\r\n3. fix `yarn benchmark`. For some reason it won't work for me in master too.\r\n4. review everything and marge to master PR with both builder and applied transformations together.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can help with any, but this should be straightforward. As its major change, also it would make sense to create manual test checklist to double check everything. I can't help creating it, as I'm not that aware in lib internals, so that's on you.\r\nHowever, I can help with testing stuff.",

Right now the migration is easy to track (if it's `.js`, we should migrate it), but with all files named `.ts` it would be more challenging.\r\n\r\nI tried to apply [recently added JSDoc plugin](https://github.com/airbnb/ts-migrate/pull/43) but couldn't make it do anything at all.

      "> Hey! Thank you for your contribution, could you please tell me how do you plan to use this feature (with a code example). I find the current API is confusing. When I see the nth day of the month, I expect it to give me the nth day, not nth day of the nth week. Do you know the problem?\r\n> \r\n> I also not sure about edge handling, but to come up with a clear solution first, I should understand what's the real-world use-case for this function.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks!\r\n\r\nHey @kossnocorp, the problem API is trying to solve is pretty simple. **Try to find the nth weekday of the month**. \r\n\r\n Eg: If you want the 2nd Sunday of  July 2020, this API will return the date you request. \r\n\r\n```js\r\ngetNthDayOfMonth(\r\nnew Date(2020, 6, 25),  // pass any date of the month you wanna find nth weekday\r\n0,  // Sunday; Days in Datefns 0 - 6 integers\r\n2  // 2nd Sunday\r\n)\r\n```\r\nOutput: \r\n`Wed Jul 12 2020`\r\n\r\nThe API will return a date, which is 2nd Sunday of the month. In this case July 12th, 2020. \r\n\r\nUsecase:\r\nIt will be useful for churches and events that meet up every nth week of a particular day in a month. So this API will return the date of the event.  \r\n\r\nThe API params made sense for me and it was based on your comment on issue #780. I have attached the comment here.\r\n\r\nThe name of the API nthDayOfMonth was based on your [comment](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/780#issuecomment-428898492) on the feature request. Believe nth**Week**dayOfMonth would be an option to be more clear. Lmk what you think. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/780#issuecomment-428898492 \r\n\r\n \r\n",

      "I'm 👎 on this change. The basic rule in Dutch is that abbreviations are indicated with the trailing dot, and it should always be used as such to avoid confusion, an example that `date-fns` should also handle correctly is:\r\n> Jan begint school weer. (John starts school again)\r\n\r\nWhich is an entirely different sentence than:\r\n\r\n> Jan. begint school weer. (School starts again in January)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.taaltelefoon.be/maanden-afkorting is more explicit on why and how it is allowed to leave the dot out, translated:\r\n> In certain contexts, like in agendas or on calendars, the dot is often left out. This is also correct.\r\n\r\nCLDR actually [supports this notion via standalone vs. formatted use](http://cldr.unicode.org/translation/date-time-1/date-time-patterns#TOC-When-to-use-Standalone-vs.-Formatting), but [uses the dot in both](https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/37/summary/nl.html#360c210ad4f23085). One could argue that standalone should drop the dot, but that would imho have to start with the CLDR, and this library could then follow.",
      "https://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1727 is also explicit btw for the same reasons as the Belgian site:\r\n> Jan/jan., feb/feb. enzovoort zijn 'echte' afkortingen. Dat wil zeggen dat jan niet wordt uitgesproken als 'jan', maar als 'januari', dus als het volledige woord waar de afkorting voor staat. Echte afkortingen worden doorgaans met een punt geschreven, bijvoorbeeld: afb. (afbeelding), sgt. (sergeant), zgn. (zogenaamd). Dat leidt tot jan., feb. of febr., mrt., apr., jun., jul., aug., sep. of sept., okt., nov. en dec. – met punt dus.\r\n>\r\n>De schrijfwijze zonder punt is echter ook juist. In lijsten, tabellen, agenda's en dergelijke wordt de punt meestal weggelaten: jan, feb, enzovoort.\r\n\r\nThis also boils down to: correct is with a dot, without is commonly accepted and also correct, but mostly used like that in tables, lists and agendas and the like.\r\n\r\nNote to outsiders: TaalAdvies is the official site of TaalUnie, the main advisory organization tracking evolution of the Dutch language and primary consultants on documenting the \"official Dutch language\".

Changes are fairly straightforward:\r\n* `add` now only calls `addMonths` if `months` or `years` adding is requested, and it only calls `addDays` if `days` or `weeks` adding is requested. This fixes #1682 by preventing calls to `Date.setXXX` in cases where those calls aren't needed, which in turn prevents mutation of the time from DST end to one hour before DST end. See https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/1682#issuecomment-625062812\r\n* `addMonths` and `addDays` now return early if `amount` of increment is zero. This prevents the same problem as #1682 but when calling `addMonths` or `addDays` directly. \r\n* Re-worked `addMonths` logic to avoid problems like #1758 which are caused by mixing UTC and local-time APIs.\r\n* Added DST tests to `add`, `addMonths`, and `addDays` to verify the fixes above.\r\n* Updated changelog",

    "body": "As documented in #1750, date-fns 2.12 (specifically #1630) contained a breaking change that made `differenceInDays` stop matching `addDays` across a DST boundary.  This PR replaces #1630 with an implementation that fixes #533 (like #1630 did) without causing #1750 (like #1630 also did).\r\n\r\nThis PR: \r\n* Fixes #1750 by restoring the 2.11 implementation of `differenceInDays` (so should code-review against 2.11 implementation) but modifying it to fix #533 without triggering #1750. It does this by replacing the use in `differenceInDays` of `compareAsc` with a new local function (`compareLocalAsc`) that compares using local time not UTC timestamps. This change prevents errors when one of the times is on a DST boundary or contains an ambiguous local time due to DST.\r\n* Adds new DST tests for `differenceInDays` to validate the work above. These tests will work in any timezone, thanks to new shared test code that detects DST start in the local timezone. All DST tests in this PR are relative to the DST start/end dates detected for the current timezone. These tests will be skipped in non-DST time zones. \r\n* Validates that all tests run OK in the America/Los_Angeles, America/Sao_Paulo, Australia/Sydney, and Europe/London timezones. This was done by temporarily adding a TZ env to the `yarn test` script command and then manually running tests under each TZ.\r\n* Adds new JSDoc content and samples for `differenceInDays` to document DST behavior and to explain how to get non-DST behavior (full 24-hour periods only) using `Math.floor(differenceInHours(dateLeft, dateRight)/24)|0`.\r\n* Adds analogous JSDoc content to `differenceInWeeks` which is implemented using `differenceInDays` and shares its DST behavior.\r\n* Updates the changelog with a new empty release section as requested in CONTRIBUTING.md,\r\n\r\n**Fix Details**\r\n\r\n#533, like most JS bugs related to DST, happened because the pre-2.12 implementation of `differenceInDays` mixed UTC and local date calculations: `CompareAsc` uses UTC comparisons while `Date.setDate` (used in `differenceInDays`) uses local timezone math. The result: on or around DST boundaries `CompareAsc` returned results which suggested that the difference was not a full day when it really was, or vice versa. This led to off-by-one errors in results like #533.\r\n\r\nThe fix was to restore the 2.11 implementation of `differenceInDays` (effectively reverting #1630) and simply replace usage of `compareAsc` with a new local function `compareLocalAsc` that uses local date math instead.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to get into the weeds to understand how `setDate` works and why #533 happened, start here: \r\n* https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-date.prototype.setdate\r\n* https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-local-time-zone-adjustment\r\n\r\n**Discussion**\r\n\r\n_\"Full Days\": 24-hour periods vs. matching local times_ \r\n\r\nSome contributors in #533 suggested that date diffs should be measured in 24-hour periods only and should ignore DST.  To see why this is problematic, imagine a user measures a 7-day period from (local) noon to (local) noon one week later.  If we only diff 24-hour periods, then that period would measure 7 days most of the year, but would return 6 days if DST started in the middle.  This intermittent variation is a certain cause of hard-to-diagnose bugs, and is also different from how date-fns has behaved for a long time.  That's why this PR goes back to the 2.11 behavior of taking DST into account.  BTW, if a developer wants to ignore DST and just count 24-hour periods, this PR documents one way (`Math.floor(differenceInHours(dateLeft, dateRight)/24)|0`) in user-visible JSDoc comments.\r\n\r\n_API Consistency_\r\n\r\nI admit that I couldn't fully understand the consistency discussion in #533. To me it seems like the pre-2.12 behavior was *more* consistent, because in 2.11 `differenceInDays` was consistent with `addDays`, and `differenceInDays` was also consistent with `differenceInMonths`.  And with JS Date APIs like `Date.setDate`.\r\n\r\n_Guidelines_\r\n\r\nIn case it's helpful, here are three general rules of thumb that I use for safe date math:\r\n* For adding/subtracting/comparing hours (and smaller) units, convert to UTC and do all math in UTC.\r\n* For adding/subtracting/comparing days (and larger) units, only use local timezone math, not UTC (unless UTC is the local timezone!) because users expect that day and larger APIs return the same results whether or not a DST transition happened.  Here's a discussion about the same topic in moment.js: https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/78#issuecomment-2979637\r\n* Know which APIs use local vs. UTC math, and don't mix them unless you really, really know what you're doing. When you mix UTC APIs like `Date.getTime` with local APIs like `Date.setDate`, it's easy to end up with off-by-one-hour bugs like #533 or #1083 1510.\r\n\r\n**Future Investigation Needed**\r\n\r\nTODO: I suspect that `differenceInMonths`, `differenceInISOWeekYears`, and `differenceInYears` are vulnerable to the same bug but I didn't have the time yet to investigate but I wanted to get this breaking-change fix out ASAP.\r\n\r\n",

      "My new tests failed in CI for the Atlantic/Azores timezone. Interestingly, the tests failed for `differenceInCalendarDays` whose implementation didn't change in this PR, so either my tests are bad or there's a DST problem with `differenceInCalendarDays`.  I can repro this failure locally and I'll investigate and push a fix, probably tomorrow.  \r\n\r\nLuckily the DST config for Atlantic/Azores is unusual: their standard time is UTC-1 and their DST is UTC, so the problem case seems pretty obvious: transitions to or from DST across or on local date boundaries and/or UTC date boundaries.\r\n\r\nKudos to the date-fns team for a great CI setup to catch weird bugs like this!",

Anyway, I'm marking this PR as a work-in-progress until I can add more tests to capture this case, and to fix it if tests fail.

    "body": "As reported in the bug report, `differenceInYears` does not work as expected when dealing with a left hand date which is a leap day.\r\n\r\nConsider the following:\r\n```\r\nconst result = differenceInYears(new Date(2024, 1, 29), new Date(2005, 02, 01));\r\n```\r\nThis would have returned the result of `19`. This is incorrect and should be `18`. The reason for this is the following:\r\n```\r\n// Line 36\r\ndateLeft.setFullYear(dateLeft.getFullYear() - sign * difference)\r\n```\r\nIn this instance, if the `sign * difference` end up reassigning the date to a non-leap year i.e. 2023, then internally the date is advanced to `1st March 2023`. While this is the default behaviour of the spec for this utility it is creating invalid results.\r\n\r\nThe setting of the year was only meant to align the two dates to the same year, so the rest of the date could be compared to see if it fell within a full year. To work around this I'm proposing we assign BOTH dates to a leap year to prevent any incorrect date reassignment.",

So, more of an expectation/uniformity thing.

    "body": "The ISO date parsing previously done in `toDate` was moved into `parseISO` to keep the minimal build size low when string date manipulation is not required (#1016). The problem is that any application that retrieves a date from an API will parse some form of serialized date string before passing it to other functions. The following is typical example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst output = format(addDays(parseISO(dateFromAPI), 1), 'yyyy-MM-dd')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs soon as `parseISO` is used in this way the benefit of removing `toDate` has been negated. The `parseISO` and `parse` functions are still around 7000 and 8000 bytes respectively. The proposed `parseUTC` function is only ~520 bytes in size and sufficient to parse the standard JSON serialized date string formats of most server-side languages. \r\n\r\nAside from complete ISO dates and the input types accepted by `toDate` the function returns an `Invalid Date`. The intention of this function will not be to parse user input, for this `parse` would still be needed, but it permits convenient parsing of date strings from an API with a known ISO format.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposed compromise/solution for the issue I raised [here](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/1016#issuecomment-498315179), and something I have used in a couple of projects recently to good effect. \r\n\r\nI am still undecided about the best name for this function. My initial thought was `parseJSONDate`, but then I realized only UTC dates are supported and calling it `parseUTC` might be more generic and describe the function more specifically.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose this function for inclusion in the core `date-fns` library, however, if it is deemed not a good fit I can also add it to `date-fns-tz`.",

    "body": "_Disclaimer: This PR is very much WIP. I'll probably restart from scratch once everything is ironed out. Indeed, the current setup has many caveats. See at the end._\r\n\r\nThis PR should close #1226 and #1190.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to typecheck the codebase using TypeScript instead of Flowtype. It poses several challenges as the build process of this library is quite involved. There are many moving parts so TypeScript, as typically used, is hard to fit in.\r\n\r\nThings done in the PR:\r\n- **Converted all JS lib files to TypeScript.** By lib files I mean actual library code, not the tests nor the benchmarks. I tried to sensibly type most of the public API but I didn't go all the way through so there are a lot of `any` types. It compiles in TypeScript's strictest settings.\r\n- **Configured TypeScript so that it emits JS files in the same place where there are TS files.** This is the default behaviour. It allows for minimal changes to the current build process (although we might want to change it further). It has the big caveat of doubling the amount of checked out source code.\r\n- **Ran prettier on all files.** I did a lot of regex-based refactoring and wanted to make sure that I could go back to a consistent style. Therefore I ran prettier on all files, both before and after the changes.\r\n- **Introduced @typescript-eslint.** ESLint does not support TypeScript by default so I had to change the config. I went for the recommended stuff, but you might want to customize it to your liking as it adds new rules.\r\n- **Commended out TS typings generation.** This used to create declaration files calling to `typings.d.ts`. Now we have the proper declaration files generated in place. This goes a long way towards #1190. What is left to do is the opposite: generate `typings.d.ts` from these declaration files. Microsoft's [API extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) does this very well.\r\n\r\nI don't think this PR deserves to be reviewed yet because the approach is probably the wrong one. I tried to minimize the changes to perform on the build process but I only made it more complicated. Even worse, `scripts/build/package.sh` has stopped working so more work would be needed.\r\n\r\nI suggest instead that we do an overhaul. This is a proposed architecture:\r\n- Code and tests all in `src/`, as today. Difference is that it would be all TypeScript, without any `.d.ts` nor `.flow` files.\r\n- A first build step dumps in `build/` the content of `src/` compiled to JavaScript, with the declaration files. We could have two TypeScript projects: one for the library code, that generates JS files with declaration files, and one for the test code, that only generates JS files. We can leverage project references to make the test code depend on the library code. An added benefit is that it becomes impossible to mistakenly import test code in the library code.\r\n- With all the JS code in `build/`, we can run tests and benchmarks from `build/` instead of `src/`, as we do today.\r\n- A second build step copies the library code and the declaration files from `build/` to `dist/` and does the following:\r\n  - it generates `typings.d.ts` using [API extractor](https://api-extractor.com/)\r\n  - it generates `.flow` files from the `.d.ts` files (the \"how\" is left to be figured out)\r\n  - it builds various bundles using Rollup (this would also solve solve #1117 and #1201)\r\n\r\nThe big change is that it we wouldn't check out JavaScript, Flow and declaration files in source control. It would only exist while building. This may affect some other things I didn't notice yet; if so, let me know.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this proposition? Of course I'm willing to do the work and document it. Let me know if you have any remarks.",

Key additions are the two time zone helper functions:\r\n\r\n- `setTimeZone` for getting a `Date` instance with the time at a given time zone\r\n- `dateAtTimeZone` for getting a `Date` with the UTC value of a time in a given time zone\r\n\r\nThe `toDate`, `format` and `parse` functions also have additional time zone support added.\r\n\r\nFor a more complete discussion of the new functionality see the [Time zone documentation](https://github.com/marnusw/date-fns/blob/timezones/docs/timeZones.md) included in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe `date-fns` library aims to support IE8+ (see #660). This PR proposes using the `Intl` API for IANA time zone support which requires a [polyfill](https://github.com/yahoo/date-time-format-timezone) in older browsers. As a compromise, all new time zone functionality fully supports the use of time zone offset values (`+0200`, `-04:00` etc.) which will work back to IE8. If you wish to use IANA time zones a polyfill will be needed though.",

We run our tests through a number of timezones: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/scripts/test_tz_extended.sh#L8-L344\r\nSome tests will fail. Right now, we have no other solution but to modify tests to exclude all dates that don't exist in any timezone. Before, we also had to deal with `phantomjs` which has a lot of timezone related bugs (basically, in `phantomjs` you can create impossible dates by manipulating them via `Date` methods, even if you can't create these dates using `Date` constructor). That's why we had to do PRs #422 and #427. Recently, we moved our automatic tests to Chromium.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- undoes #427 and test changes of #422\r\n- updates Travis CI to the `trusty` environment that includes one of the latest versions of Chromium (Chromium 53.0.2785 at the moment)\r\n- excludes locale tests when testing through timezones (locales are supposed to be timezone-independent) to speed up the Travis CI tests. Makes the difference between [passed test](https://travis-ci.org/date-fns/date-fns/builds/200302803) and [failed due to the time restriction](https://travis-ci.org/date-fns/date-fns/builds/200263583).

An exception of type `Error` should be thrown if `interval.start.getTime() > interval.end.getTime()`.\r\n\r\n- If function uses a difference between two dates **regardless of the exact values of two dates** and it is always **non-negative**, use word **\"duration\"** in the name of the function. See #284 \r\n\r\n- If function manipulates dates in any other way, **do not** use suffix **\"date\"**. For example, use `addDays` instead of `addDaysToDate`. \"Date\" is already in the name of library:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport addDaysToDate from 'date-fns/addDays' // ok\r\nimport addDaysToDate from 'date-fns/addDaysToDate' // tautologic\r\n```\r\n\r\nExceptions: `toDate`, `isDate`.\r\n\r\n- Use **date** to signify **the days of the month**.

This means that I cannot utilise these translation dictionaries to render out a textual list of months, for example, without being very hacky, and providing a superfluous timestamp to each.\r\n\r\nIn order to solve this, I've created a new method `.getTranslation` on each `locale` object, that, given a formatter token (as per [`format`](https://date-fns.org/docs/format)), and an optional index, returns a single translated phrase at that index. If the optional index isn't provided, the whole list is returned.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst daLocale = require('date-fns/locale/da');\r\n\r\ndaLocale.getTranslation('MMM')\r\n$> ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'maj', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'okt', 'nov', 'dec']\r\n\r\ndaLocale.getTranslation('dddd', 3)\r\n$> onsdag\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is now a translations dictionary for each locale (located in `./locale/*/translations/index.js`), from which this new method obtains its values. This dictionary is also used for each method that requires it in each `build_format_locale`.\r\n\r\nHope it proves of some use!",
