In this approach, the model predicts one step ahead at a time. For this study of power consumption, this will mean predicting the usage for the next 10 minutes based solely on the historical values of that specific variable up to the current timestep. Thus, using past observations of the single variable Total Power Consumption, we will estimate future values for the given number of future timesteps.

Every entry should be marked with an 'X' to be get the Pull Request approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] All `import`s are in the first cell? \r\n    - [X] First block of imports are standard libraries\r\n    - [X] Second block are 3rd party libraries\r\n    - [X] Third block are all `arcgis` imports? Note that in some cases, for samples, it is a good idea to keep the imports next to where they are used, particularly for uncommonly used features that we want to highlight.\r\n- [X] All `GIS` object instantiations are one of the following?\r\n    - `gis = GIS()`\r\n    - `gis = GIS('home')` or `gis = GIS('pro')`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_online_portal\")`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_enterprise_portal\")`\r\n- [ ] If this notebook requires setup or teardown, did you add the appropriate code to `./misc/setup.py` and/or `./misc/teardown.py`?\r\n- [X] If this notebook references any portal items that need to be staged on AGOL/Python API playground, did you coordinate with a Python API team member to stage the item the correct way with the `api_data_owner` user?\r\n- [ ] If the notebook requires working with local data (such as CSV, FGDB, SHP, Raster files), upload the files as items to the [Geosaurus Online Org](geosaurus.maps.arcgis.com/) using `api_data_owner` account and change the notebook to first download and unpack the files.\r\n- [X] Code simplified & split out across multiple cells, useful comments?\r\n- [X] Consistent voice/tense/narrative style? Thoroughly checked for typos?\r\n- [ ] All images used like `<img src=\"base64str_here\">` instead of `<img src=\"https://some.url\">`? All map widgets contain a static image preview? (Call `mapview_inst.take_screenshot()` to do so)\r\n- [X] All file paths are constructed in an OS-agnostic fashion with `os.path.join()`? (Instead of `r\"\\foo\\bar\"`, `os.path.join(os.path.sep, \"foo\", \"bar\")`, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Is your code formatted using [Jupyter Black](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/auto-format-your-python-code-with-black/)? You can use Jupyter Black to format your code in the  notebook.\r\n- [ ] **If this notebook showcases deep learning capabilities, please go through the following checklist:**\r\n    - [ ] Are the inputs required for `Export Training Data Using Deep Learning` tool published on geosaurus org (api data owner account) and added in the notebook using `gis.content.get` function?\r\n    - [ ] Is training data zipped and published as Image Collection? Note: Whole folder is zipped with name same as the notebook name.\r\n    - [ ] Are the inputs required for model inferencing published on geosaurus org (api data owner account) and added in the notebook using `gis.content.get` function? Note: This includes providing test raster and trained model.\r\n    - [ ] Are the inferenced results displayed using a webmap widget?\r\n- [X] **IF YOU WANT THIS SAMPLE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DEVELOPERS.ARCGIS.COM WEBSITE**, ping @jyaistMap so he can add it to the list for the next deploy.",

Fortunately, deep learning models provide an efficient way to compute and predict VCI. In this study, we propose an approach to predicting VCI from Landsat 5 &amp; 8 imagery using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.learn.toc.html#pix2pixhd\" target=\"_blank\">Pix2PixHD</a>&nbsp;deep learning model. The VCI will be computed for both Landsat 5 &amp; Landsat 8 using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The calculated VCI will then be used to train an image translation Pix2Pix model. The model will then be capable of translating Landsat-5 &amp; Landsat-8 multispectral imagery to VCI, allowing the predictions to be used for multitemporal monitoring of VCI.</p>\n<br/>\n\n \n<div class='ThreadMetadata-DoNotDelete' data-state='OPEN' data-cellIndex='3' data-originalCommitID='551d7f7a13e5bf46c681c97b2693040ff6e49337' data-path='samples/04_gis_analysts_data_scientists/vci_estimation_from_multispectral_imagery_landsat_using_pix2pix.ipynb'/>\n\n<div id='100039' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='BP-Ent' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64601621?v=4' data-createdAt='2024-09-30T20:48:49Z'/>\n",

So it might be worth mentioning that and explaining that the clone_items() method won't recognize two items named the same, but that it will recognize if one item has been cloned from another. <em>  </em></li></ul>\n<br/>\n\n \n\n<div class='ThreadMetadata-DoNotDelete' data-state='RESOLVED' data-cellIndex='26' data-originalCommitID='0124e120f1a8de3afaa969fd3880c8ab41210047' data-path='guide/13-managing-arcgis-applications/cloning-complex-apps.ipynb'/>\n\n<div id='629757' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='jyaistMap' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1399179?v=4' data-createdAt='2023-10-25T21:04:19Z'/>\n",

      "> Hey John! The guide looks great. I just have one question - what is the url that 'Relationship types' (under Inspecting offline packages) is supposed to open? It seems like it's empty or so now because it keeps opening up the github PR url.\r\n\r\nOOOOOPPPPS!!!!! Thanks for catching that! I forgot to add it :O It's this link `https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/users-groups-and-items/relationship-types.htm`. I'm not 100% sure if this is the proper relative link format to get to the rest api...but it looks correct when I build the site locally!"

Note that in some cases, for samples, it is a good idea to keep the imports next to where they are used, particularly for uncommonly used features that we want to highlight.\r\n- [ ] All `GIS` object instantiations are one of the following?\r\n    - `gis = GIS()`\r\n    - `gis = GIS('home')` or `gis = GIS('pro')`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_online_portal\")`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_enterprise_portal\")`\r\n- [ ] If this notebook requires setup or teardown, did you add the appropriate code to `./misc/setup.py` and/or `./misc/teardown.py`?\r\n- [ ] If this notebook references any portal items that need to be staged on AGOL/Python API playground, did you coordinate with a Python API team member to stage the item the correct way with the `api_data_owner` user?\r\n- [ ] If the notebook requires working with local data (such as CSV, FGDB, SHP, Raster files), upload the files as items to the [Geosaurus Online Org](geosaurus.maps.arcgis.com/) using `api_data_owner` account and change the notebook to first download and unpack the files.\r\n- [ ] Code simplified & split out across multiple cells, useful comments?\r\n- [ ] Consistent voice/tense/narrative style? Thoroughly checked for typos?\r\n- [ ] All images used like `<img src=\"base64str_here\">` instead of `<img src=\"https://some.url\">`? All map widgets contain a static image preview? (Call `mapview_inst.take_screenshot()` to do so)\r\n- [ ] All file paths are constructed in an OS-agnostic fashion with `os.path.join()`? (Instead of `r\"\\foo\\bar\"`, `os.path.join(os.path.sep, \"foo\", \"bar\")`, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Is your code formatted using [Jupyter Black](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/auto-format-your-python-code-with-black/)? You can use Jupyter Black to format your code in the  notebook.\r\n- [ ] **IF YOU WANT THIS SAMPLE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DEVELOPERS.ARCGIS.COM WEBSITE**, ping @ mohi9282 so he can add it to the list for the next deploy \r\n",

Every entry should be marked with an 'X' to be get the Pull Request approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] All `import`s are in the first cell? \r\n    - [ ] First block of imports are standard libraries\r\n    - [ ] Second block are 3rd party libraries\r\n    - [ ] Third block are all `arcgis` imports? Note that in some cases, for samples, it is a good idea to keep the imports next to where they are used, particularly for uncommonly used features that we want to highlight.\r\n- [ ] All `GIS` object instantiations are one of the following?\r\n    - `gis = GIS()`\r\n    - `gis = GIS('home')` or `gis = GIS('pro')`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_online_portal\")`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_enterprise_portal\")`\r\n- [ ] If this notebook requires setup or teardown, did you add the appropriate code to `./misc/setup.py` and/or `./misc/teardown.py`?\r\n- [ ] If this notebook references any portal items that need to be staged on AGOL/Python API playground, did you coordinate with a Python API team member to stage the item the correct way with the `api_data_owner` user?\r\n- [ ] If the notebook requires working with local data (such as CSV, FGDB, SHP, Raster files), upload the files as items to the [Geosaurus Online Org](geosaurus.maps.arcgis.com/) using `api_data_owner` account and change the notebook to first download and unpack the files.\r\n- [ ] Code simplified & split out across multiple cells, useful comments?\r\n- [ ] Consistent voice/tense/narrative style? Thoroughly checked for typos?\r\n- [ ] All images used like `<img src=\"base64str_here\">` instead of `<img src=\"https://some.url\">`? All map widgets contain a static image preview? (Call `mapview_inst.take_screenshot()` to do so)\r\n- [ ] All file paths are constructed in an OS-agnostic fashion with `os.path.join()`? (Instead of `r\"\\foo\\bar\"`, `os.path.join(os.path.sep, \"foo\", \"bar\")`, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Is your code formatted using [Jupyter Black](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/auto-format-your-python-code-with-black/)? You can use Jupyter Black to format your code in the  notebook.\r\n- [ ] **IF YOU WANT THIS SAMPLE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DEVELOPERS.ARCGIS.COM WEBSITE**, ping @ mohi9282 so he can add it to the list for the next deploy \r\n",

Among the various remote sensing technologies, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology-based datasets are particularly valuable due to their ability to capture cloud-free imagery under all weather and lighting conditions, making them ideal for continuous Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) analysis. This notebook presents an end-to-end deep learning workflow to perform automated land use land cover classification on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery using&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">ArcGIS API for Python</a>,</code>enhancing the process using&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/geoai/train-using-autodl.htm\" target=\"_blank\">AutoDL</a></code>&nbsp;(Automated Deep Learning) and fine-tuning the best deep learning model suggested by AutoDL.</p><p> </p><p>AutoDL is a tool that automates model selection, architecture optimization, and hyperparameter tuning and suggests the best-fit model for the input training dataset from the supported models. By integrating AutoDL, the workflow becomes more efficient and accessible, reducing the need for extensive manual experimentation while maintaining high model performance. The process in this notebook includes extracting training samples, getting the best model using AutoDL, fine-tuning a pixel segmentation model using the SAR dataset, and deploying the <a href=\"https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/image-analyst/deep-learning-models-in-arcgis.htm\" target=\"_blank\">DLPK </a>model on <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">ArcGIS Online</a> for inferencing/predicting on unseen datasets to generate accurate, large-area LULC maps.</p>\n<br/>\n\n \n<div class='ThreadMetadata-DoNotDelete' data-state='OPEN' data-cellIndex='3' data-originalCommitID='8c45aeeadffb0c661221c867e1ea925bc25422b9' data-path='samples/04_gis_analysts_data_scientists/land_use_land_cover_mapping_using_sar_data.ipynb'/>\n\n<div id='404166' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='neha-sharma-geoai' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125634000?v=4' data-createdAt='2025-04-17T14:41:17Z'/>\n",

Every entry should be marked with an 'X' to be get the Pull Request approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] All `import`s are in the first cell? \r\n    - [ ] First block of imports are standard libraries\r\n    - [ ] Second block are 3rd party libraries\r\n    - [ ] Third block are all `arcgis` imports? Note that in some cases, for samples, it is a good idea to keep the imports next to where they are used, particularly for uncommonly used features that we want to highlight.\r\n- [ ] All `GIS` object instantiations are one of the following?\r\n    - `gis = GIS()`\r\n    - `gis = GIS('home')` or `gis = GIS('pro')`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_online_portal\")`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_enterprise_portal\")`\r\n- [ ] If this notebook requires setup or teardown, did you add the appropriate code to `./misc/setup.py` and/or `./misc/teardown.py`?\r\n- [ ] If this notebook references any portal items that need to be staged on AGOL/Python API playground, did you coordinate with a Python API team member to stage the item the correct way with the `api_data_owner` user?\r\n- [ ] If the notebook requires working with local data (such as CSV, FGDB, SHP, Raster files), upload the files as items to the [Geosaurus Online Org](geosaurus.maps.arcgis.com/) using `api_data_owner` account and change the notebook to first download and unpack the files.\r\n- [ ] Code simplified & split out across multiple cells, useful comments?\r\n- [ ] Consistent voice/tense/narrative style? Thoroughly checked for typos?\r\n- [ ] All images used like `<img src=\"base64str_here\">` instead of `<img src=\"https://some.url\">`? All map widgets contain a static image preview? (Call `mapview_inst.take_screenshot()` to do so)\r\n- [ ] All file paths are constructed in an OS-agnostic fashion with `os.path.join()`? (Instead of `r\"\\foo\\bar\"`, `os.path.join(os.path.sep, \"foo\", \"bar\")`, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Is your code formatted using [Jupyter Black](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/auto-format-your-python-code-with-black/)? You can use Jupyter Black to format your code in the  notebook.\r\n- [ ] **IF YOU WANT THIS SAMPLE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DEVELOPERS.ARCGIS.COM WEBSITE**, ping @ mohi9282 so he can add it to the list for the next deploy \r\n",

Other imagery, however, is more difficult to visualize and incorporate into your GIS. Such non-nadir oriented imagery includes oblique, bubble, 360-degree, street-side, and inspection imagery, among others. Through this sample, we will demonstrate the utility of an object detection model for detecting objects in oriented imagery using <code>ArcGIS API for Python</code>. </p><p>The <code>arcgis.learn</code> module supports a number of object detection models, such as <code>SingleShotDetector</code>, <code>RetinaNet</code>, <code>FasterRCNN</code>, <code>YoloV3</code>, and more. In this notebook, we will be using the <code>YoloV3</code> model for detecting traffic lights in oriented imagery. The biggest advantage of <code>YOLOv3</code> in <code>arcgis.learn</code>, is that it comes preloaded with weights pretrained on the <a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/#home\" target=\"_blank\">COCO dataset</a>. This makes it ready-to-use for the 80 common objects (car, truck, person, etc.) that are part of the COCO dataset.

      "@BP-Ent Thanks for the review. I've made the requested changes.",
      "@ManushiM \r\n* the guide works when run against the changes you submitted to the geosaurus PR\r\n* I think the guide would help new users to hub if more explanation is added, or if links to what happens behind the scenes when a Site is created  is added\r\n  * For instance, at the end of the guide the Site 1 item is deleted, but that does not delete the default groups created when the site was created, and since the guide does not delete the cloned items in either the same org or the enterprise org, the site and page items as well as the supporting groups are going to exist within those organizations, but unless the user running this guide already understands all of that, it will lead to stray items and groups from the clones that will have to be handled separately.\r\n",
      "Thanks @jyaistMap for the review! \r\n\r\nI added the snippet to delete the first site created as a means to demonstrate the site deletion process, without any intent to clean up stray items. Do you recommend we clean all those items up within this guide? ",
      "> Thanks @jyaistMap for the review!\r\n> \r\n> I added the snippet to delete the first site created as a means to demonstrate the site deletion process, without any intent to clean up stray items. Do you recommend we clean all those items up within this guide?\r\n\r\nHi @ManushiM - \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Guides are meant to be explanatory how-to documents. In addition to showing how to write the code, we should provide comprehensive explanations as to what happens when the code is run, including supporting items that may or may not get created, privileges necessary, and cleanup. We're going through the results of poor clean up practices on the python api playground. I think all this should be at least mentioned in the guide with links to supporting documentation where appropriate. \r\n\r\n- also as a reminder, the code explicitly mentioning your user names is still in the guide. Those should be changed to `your_online_profile` or `your_online_admin_profile` or `your_enterprise_profile` or `your_ent_admin_profile` where appropriate.",
      "@jyaistMap \r\n\r\nThanks for the clarification, John! I made changes to the guides with updated profiles in all GIS objects, a description of what creating and deleting initiatives/sites does and also updated this particular guide to delete all stray items/groups. ",

It can have multiple applications and can be very useful in understanding an area, its geography, landscape, demographic, and more. Landcover classification can be further combined with building footprint extraction and object detection for even more detailed analysis. Currently, this is achieved through multiple models. However, using Panoptic Segmentation, we can detect objects of interest and also classify the pixels of a raster using a single model.  </p><p>Panoptic Segmentation works with both types of classes - stuff and things. In deep learning jargon, stuff refers to the class that is indistinctive and uncountable, for example, vegetation, road, water, sky, etc. Most of the land cover classes will classify as stuff. Things refers to classes that are distinctive, for example, buildings, cars, pools, solar panels, etc., and are also referred to as instance classes. </p><p>Panoptic Segmentation models use three inputs during training - a raster, a feature layer or a classified raster that classifies each pixel in the raster into individual classes, and a feature layer containing polygons for the objects of interest (the instance classes). This notebook demonstrates how to use the Panoptic Segmentation model MaXDeepLab to classify Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and extract building footprints and cars using very high-resolution satellite imagery of Los Angeles County. The model has been trained using the ArcGIS Python API. The trained model can then be deployed in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Enterprise to classify LULC and extract building footprints and cars.</p>\n<br/>\n\n \n\n<div class='ThreadMetadata-DoNotDelete' data-state='RESOLVED' data-cellIndex='3' data-originalCommitID='31fef788f9ccbc2091e9fd846db2645ca0104b54' data-path='samples/04_gis_analysts_data_scientists/extracting_features_and_land_use_land_cover_using_panoptic_segmentation.ipynb'/>\n\n<div id='820625' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='BP-Ent' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64601621?v=4' data-createdAt='2022-12-29T20:43:27Z'/>\n",

Note that in some cases, for samples, it is a good idea to keep the imports next to where they are used, particularly for uncommonly used features that we want to highlight.\r\n- [ ] All `GIS` object instantiations are one of the following?\r\n    - `gis = GIS()`\r\n    - `gis = GIS('home')` or `gis = GIS('pro')`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_online_portal\")`\r\n    - `gis = GIS(profile=\"your_enterprise_portal\")`\r\n- [ ] If this notebook requires setup or teardown, did you add the appropriate code to `./misc/setup.py` and/or `./misc/teardown.py`?\r\n- [ ] If this notebook references any portal items that need to be staged on AGOL/Python API playground, did you coordinate with a Python API team member to stage the item the correct way with the `api_data_owner` user?\r\n- [ ] If the notebook requires working with local data (such as CSV, FGDB, SHP, Raster files), upload the files as items to the [Geosaurus Online Org](geosaurus.maps.arcgis.com/) using `api_data_owner` account and change the notebook to first download and unpack the files.\r\n- [ ] Code simplified & split out across multiple cells, useful comments?\r\n- [ ] Consistent voice/tense/narrative style? Thoroughly checked for typos?\r\n- [ ] All images used like `<img src=\"base64str_here\">` instead of `<img src=\"https://some.url\">`? All map widgets contain a static image preview? (Call `mapview_inst.take_screenshot()` to do so)\r\n- [ ] All file paths are constructed in an OS-agnostic fashion with `os.path.join()`? (Instead of `r\"\\foo\\bar\"`, `os.path.join(os.path.sep, \"foo\", \"bar\")`, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Is your code formatted using [Jupyter Black](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/auto-format-your-python-code-with-black/)? You can use Jupyter Black to format your code in the  notebook.\r\n- [X] **IF YOU WANT THIS SAMPLE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DEVELOPERS.ARCGIS.COM WEBSITE**, ping @ mohi9282 so he can add it to the list for the next deploy \r\n",

      "> Overall notebook looks great.\r\n> \r\n> * I made some comments in NBReview\r\n> * had conversation with Chunming about the data download procedures and adding a toc\r\n\r\nHi @jyaistMap,\r\nI have addressed all comments you made here, except for the data download part. In order to download the data, not only that you need to create an account, but you also have to authorize the download by linking the access to [GES DISC](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) to your account, before kick-start the download process with wget or curl. NASA provides a guide that really helps (https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot archive the data along with the notebook - Joanne said this is violating Maxar and NASA's copyright agreement.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I understand your teams message correctly, does that I mean I don't need to create the TOC in the notebook? since the dev site automatically derives `h2` and `h3` headlines?? Many thanks,\r\nChunming ",
      "Correct, @CMPeng You don't need to create the table of Contents in the notebook.  The dev site automatically derives the appropriate headings based on the markdown in the markdown cell (based on the ## or ###)"

Again - I'm super inexperienced with this kind of data, but these are the questions that come up in my mind when I look at this.\r\n\r\nGood question, John (but also a complicated question). First thing first, I have added some explanations on how to get information from `GetCapabilities` and `DescribeFeatureType` calls with `WFS` in the new commit, and shortened the `wfs_txt` needed for input in the notebook, hope now that it is clearer for readers.\r\n\r\nThen, how would a user know the right procedures needed to create a `wfs`? currently, Python API does not provide straight-forward solutions for user to do a simple `WFSLayer()` initialization. So a user has to write the WFS from scratch, or follow the sample cell I wrote here (guess that's why Jim Mason and Jun found our API difficult to use for OGC services in the first place). (Good news is, we support WMS and WMTS Layer construction now)\r\n\r\nLast, \"Can the _wfs_url _be used to create an _OGCFeatureService _layer and then the properties from there can be used to build this dictionary?\" Unfortunately it can't. I tried but failed~ The code underneath was trying to fetch an endpoint that ends with `HostedFeatureService` - I think this endpoint is for hosted services instead of services published on the server side (e.g. WFS). The procedures to publish a WFS service item used in the notebook is what we can do with Python API for now. Hopefully that in the future there will be improvements (esp. to how it being rendered in the map widget).",
      "Hi @jyaistMap, please see my newly pushed commits, and answers to your questions above.\r\nSorry that the implementation to publish WFS services and render the web map do not look great. But this is the only workflow (or say work-around) that works out with Python API for now. And I did not provide introduction to what WMS, WMTS and WFS services are, and how they work out (only providing links to these definitions in the ArcGIS Online and OGC help doc). This sample notebook was originally targeting experienced users like Jim and Jun who dealt with OGC services in ArcMap/Pro/ArcGIS Online before, and has not touched the foundation knowledge that users new to OGC services need to learn.\r\nPlease let me know if you still have concerns for the WFS section, or maybe I shall just take it off from the notebook (since it requires pre-requisite knowledge to OGC services endpoints). Many thanks!!",
      "Hi @CMPeng \r\n * Thank you for adding the explanatory text - to me this reads much better in that it guides me on where the information is coming from that was used to construct that `wfs_txt` dictionary. \r\n * I think providing the link in the guide suffices to provide users who might be new with an outlet for investigating the background if they so choose. Given it's a sample, I think it's fair to target more advanced users and provide newer users this link.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to merge this sample and then we can update it in the future if we think that's necessary.\r\n"

They often strike without warning and can occur when large volumes of water fall in a short time, causing flash floods. Flood mapping is typically performed using the following methods:</p><ul><li>Aerial observations</li><li>Ground surveys</li></ul><p>However, when flooding is widespread, these methods become prohibitively expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, aerial observation and optical imagery can often prove difficult, if not impossible, due to obstructive weather conditions. During flooding conditions, clouds can prevent the use of optical satellite imagery for visualization and analysis. In these instances, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) allows us to penetrate through clouds and hazy atmospheric conditions to continuously observe and map flooding.</p><p> </p><p>In 2019, severe flooding occurred in the Midwest of the United States. Also known as the Great Flood of 2019, 14 million people were affected across multiple states. In this analysis, we will perform flood mapping and infrastructural inundation mapping of the St. Peters region of Missouri, which was one of the affected areas during the flood.</p>\n<br/>\n\n \n\n<div class='ThreadMetadata-DoNotDelete' data-state='RESOLVED' data-cellIndex='3' data-originalCommitID='c973bd573b6fcb403a5b9121e69b518d75ce31a7' data-path='samples/04_gis_analysts_data_scientists/flood_inundation_mapping_using_sar_data_and_deep_learning.ipynb'/>\n\n<div id='261780' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='BP-Ent' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64601621?v=4' data-createdAt='2022-12-27T20:09:06Z'/>\n",

Predicting housing prices can help an individual get the most out of their building, which can further help in affordability. Traditionally, appraising the value of a property entails visiting the site, valuing the features of the building, and quoting a price on the basis of prior sales, future development of the town, market knowledge, utilities, and various other things that contribute to an asset's value.</p><p> </p><p>In machine learning, housing prediction is considered a regression task. Many machine learning approaches have been used to get better results. However, as more methods continue to be developed, it has become difficult for an individual to keep track of which method to use. Fortunately, <code>AutoML</code> helps by providing the best fit model among all available methods.

      "@jyaistMap The new commit still opened in a 404 page for me. Will using `../../samples/` and `../../api-reference` work?",
      "Hi @CMPeng - based on discussions with the Developer Website team, we've learned when writing Guides, links to other guide pages work through relative paths (`../`), but links to the `samples` and `api-reference` must begin with (`/python/`). When I hover over `sample-notebooks` and `api reference` text and look at the url that shows up in the lower left hand corner, the syntax looks correct based on what @mohi9282 and I have learned about how the new website builds pages.\r\n\r\nAny additional thoughts, @mohi9282?"

There are many forecasting models, a few of which require explanatory variables like population, social distancing, etc. This notebook uses the deep learning <code>TimeSeriesModel</code> from <code>arcgis.learn</code> for data modeling and is helpful in the prediction of future trends.  </p><p>To demonstrate the utility of this method, this notebook will analyze confirmed cases for all counties in Alabama. The dataset contains the unique county FIPS ID, county Name, State ID, and cumulative confirmed cases datewise for each county. The dataset ranges from January 2020 to February 2022, with the data from January 2022 to&nbsp;February 2022 being used to validate the quality of the forecast. The approach utilized in this analysis for forecasting future COVID-19 cases involves: (a) Data Processing (calculating the seven day moving average for removing the noise and vertically stacking the county data), (b) creating functions for test-train splitting, tabular data preparation, model fitting using Inception Time for a sequence length of 60, and forecasting, and (c) validation and visualization of the predicted data and results.</p>\n<br/>\n\n \n\n<div class='ThreadMetadata-DoNotDelete' data-state='RESOLVED' data-cellIndex='3' data-originalCommitID='599c7cd84f383616bf1da704684c549bcbdafa03' data-path='samples/04_gis_analysts_data_scientists/covid_case_forecasting_for_alabama_state_using_timeseriesmodel_from_arcgis_learn.ipynb'/>\n\n<div id='951485' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='BP-Ent' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64601621?v=4' data-createdAt='2022-04-25T22:49:02Z'/>\n",

Such non-nadir \"oriented imagery\" includes oblique, bubble, 360-degree, street-side, and inspection imagery, among others. Through this sample, we will demonstrate the utility of an object detection model for detecting objects in an oriented imagery using ArcGIS API for Python.</p><p> </p><p>The arcgis.learn module supports number of object detection models such as SingleShotDetector, RetinaNet, FasterRCNN, YoloV3 and even more. In the notebook, we will be using YoloV3 model for detecting traffic lights in the oriented imagery. The biggest advantage of YOLOv3 in&nbsp;<code>arcgis.learn</code>&nbsp;is that it comes preloaded with weights pretrained on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/\" target=\"_blank\">COCO dataset</a>. This makes it ready-to-use for the 80 common objects (car, truck, person, etc.) that are part of the COCO dataset. </p>\n<br/>\n\n \n<div class='ThreadMetadata-DoNotDelete' data-state='OPEN' data-cellIndex='3' data-originalCommitID='6493559aea428a4c83b70c64a882bf0831700bdc' data-path='samples/04_gis_analysts_data_scientists/traffic_light_detection_on_oriented_imagery.ipynb'/>\n\n<div id='118450' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='priyankatuteja' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39754605?v=4' data-createdAt='2022-12-21T05:35:46Z'/>\n",

The images acquired have opened multiple doors for studies observing the earth. In 2015, Sentinel-2, with 10 m resolution imagery, further enhanced our ability to study and observe the earth. Now, with the advancements in deep learning techniques, there is a need to revisit historic images from the Landsat program and increase their resolution to perform studies at a higher resolution.     </p><p>In this sample notebook, we will see how we can make use of the Pix2Pix model to convert 30 meter resolution Landsat 8 imagery to 10 meter resolution Sentinel-2 imagery, thus allowing us to use Landsat 8 imagery for processes like precision agriculture.</p>\n<br/>\n\n \n\n\n<span id='743020' class='CommentSeparator-DoNotDelete'> _guneetmutreja commented on 2022-01-31T04:35:59Z_\n----------------------------------------------------------------</span>\n<p>Done</p>\n\n<div class='ThreadMetadata-DoNotDelete' data-state='RESOLVED' data-cellIndex='3' data-originalCommitID='8b7bf3d1d07e5a8a571ed22fd4dca9872e34a250' data-path='samples/04_gis_analysts_data_scientists/landsat8_to_sentinel2_pix2pix.ipynb'/>\n\n<div id='894091' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='BP-Ent' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64601621?v=4' data-createdAt='2022-01-21T20:13:29Z'/>\n\n<div id='743020' class='CommentFooter-DoNotDelete' data-authorLogin='guneetmutreja' data-authorAvatarURL='https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13011513?v=4' data-createdAt='2022-01-31T04:35:59Z'/>\n",

In doing such, users can determine the scale of super blooming and the area/percentage of improved vegetation coverage for the study sites.\r\n\r\nHi @AtmaMani ,\r\nCan you please review the sample and see if this is good by itself?\r\nI have kept the chapters for 6. training based on soil moisture index, and 7. maximum likelihood for classification in my local copy, thinking that these two can already make a long notebook by itself, and not necessarily for Poppy Fields (but for a general crop type classification topic).\r\nThanks!",
